New  Zealand citizens, businesses and the Government are readily  embracing the many advantages that these technologies offer.    Everyday activities such as banking, shopping and accessing  government services are increasingly being carried out online  whenever  and  wherever  it  is  convenient  for  people  to  do  so.    New  Zealand  businesses  are  using  the  Internet  and  other  digital  technologies  to  access  new  markets,  drive  process  efficiencies and improve their service delivery.                                                                                       The   Government’s   Ultra-Fast   Broadband   and   Rural   Broadband   initiatives   will   help   New  Zealanders maximise the benefits of the Internet by providing significantly faster broadband.  At the same time, our increasing use of the Internet and other digital technologies increases our  vulnerability to cyber threats.  Criminals are increasingly using cyber space to gain access to  personal  information,  steal  businesses’  intellectual  property,  and  gain  knowledge  of  sensitive  government-held information for financial or political gain or other malicious purposes.  National  borders present no barrier.    New  Zealand’s  Cyber  Security  Strategy  is  the  Government’s  response  to  the  growing  cyber  threat.  The Strategy builds on existing government and non-government efforts to improve New  Zealand’s cyber security.  It brings forward targeted initiatives aimed at improving cyber security  for individuals, businesses, critical national infrastructure and government.    The  Strategy  reflects  the  fact  that  an  improved  New  Zealand  cyber  security  response  is  a  shared responsibility.   Government will continue  to  partner  with industry  and non-government  organisations to ensure the initiatives outlined in the Strategy are delivered in the most effective  and efficient way.  Meeting  the  evolving  cyber  threat  requires  ongoing  vigilance  and  flexibility  to  respond  to  the  changing environment.  I am confident we can work together to meet this challenge.                                   Hon Steven Joyce  Minister for Communications and Information Technology                                                                                                              MED11    MED1186216                                                                                                                      1

The Internet and digital  technologies  enable  New  Zealanders  to  have  global  access   to   products   and   services   and   reduce   our  geographical isolation by connecting us with the rest of  the world.    Access  to  greater  internet  bandwidth  and  wireless  technology  –  in  particular  mobile  devices  such  as  smart phones – is transforming how New Zealanders  access the Internet and how business is transacted in  New   Zealand.   Convenient,   high-speed               access   to  information and services is increasingly in demand.                                                                              Our     critical    national     infrastructure      providers,      including     the     banking      and     finance,  telecommunications,  transportation  and  energy  sectors,  and  other  businesses,  are  more  and  more reliant on digital systems.  Government  agencies  utilise  the  Internet,  digital  document management  systems  and  shared  online  platforms  in  their  day-to-day  business.    Increasingly,  New  Zealanders  are  accessing  government  services  online,  to  complete  tasks  such  as  submitting  tax  returns  and  making  applications for passport renewals and student loans.       Internet Usage                                                                                           1   •  At least 75% of New Zealanders have access to the Internet at home.                                                                                                  2   •  Over 70% of New Zealand Internet subscribers have access to broadband.     •  77% of New Zealand businesses use Internet banking and 50% of rural businesses buy goods                               3      and services online.   With our ever-increasing  use of, and reliance  on, the Internet and  digital technologies comes  increased exposure, and vulnerability, to cyber threats.    Cyber      attacks     are   becoming        more     advanced       and     sophisticated.      Incidents     reported  internationally suggest that attacks are increasingly targeted at intellectual property and other  proprietary  information  held  by  businesses,  as  well  as  at  individuals.    Many  attackers  are  coordinated, well-funded, and investing heavily in new ways to exploit the digital environment.                                               1 Statistics New Zealand Household Use of ICT Survey – 2009.  2 As above.  3 MYOB Business Monitor Internet survey – 2011.

The Role of Government  New  Zealand  is  not  immune  from  cyber  attacks.    A  successful  targeted  cyber  attack  could  disrupt  our  critical  services,  negatively  impact  our  economy  and,  potentially,  threaten  our  national  security.    Cyber  attacks  can  interfere  with  the  production  and  delivery  of  essential  goods and services or result in the theft of intellectual property or personal information.   New Zealand’s cyber security response must meet the challenging nature of the increasing and  evolving cyber security threat.  New Zealand needs to ensure its cyber security activities are as  coordinated and effective as possible to be able to identify and mitigate emerging cyber threats.  The  Government  has  a  responsibility  to  protect  its  own  systems  and  assist  critical  national  infrastructure  providers  to  ensure  New  Zealanders  and  New  Zealand  businesses  can  access  government and other essential services.    The Government also has a role in helping to provide a safe digital environment for businesses  and individuals to operate in.  This includes helping New Zealanders and businesses to be more  aware  of  cyber  threats,  and  how  to  take  measures  to  protect  themselves,  and  establishing  appropriate organisational and legal frameworks.     Government units have already been established to tackle issues such as scams, spam, identity  theft,  electronic  crime  and  critical  national  infrastructure  protection.    The  Government  also  provides  support  to  NetSafe,  an  independent  non-profit  organisation,  to  deliver  cyber  safety  education and awareness programmes in schools.    The Government is actively working with New Zealand’s international security partners on cyber  security  issues  and  is  currently  reviewing  New  Zealand’s  legal  framework  in  relation  to  the  growing issue of international cyber crime.                                                  4 PandaLabs Annual Security Report – 2010.  5 IBM X-Force Trend and Risk Report – 2010.  6 As above.  7 As above.

New  Zealanders  are  already  targets  of  common  cyber  threats, such as malware, scams and identity theft.    Attackers  exploit  vulnerabilities  in  software,  hardware  and user behaviour.  They take advantage of people who  fail  to  follow  basic  cyber  security  practices,  such  as  regularly     updating      their    passwords,        updating      their  antivirus software and using protected wireless networks.                                                                                  Once attackers have access to a computer or network, they can steal or distort the information  stored on it, corrupt its operations or program it to attack other computers and systems.     Unprotected home computers that are infected with malware can be used as a resource to build  botnets.  Botnets  harness  the  computing  power  of  thousands  or  even  millions  of  individual  computers to launch remote attacks on information and communications networks, commercial  systems and government websites with the aim of denying the legitimate use of the service.       The Threat to New Zealand                                                                                                        8   •  70% of New Zealand adults have been the targets of some form of cyber crime  , with the most                                                                                               9      common complaints being computer scams, fraud and viruses/malware.     •  New Zealanders are frequently the targets of international scams and fraud attempts, losing up                                                      10      to $500 million due to scams annually.               •  International data suggests 133,000 New Zealanders per annum are victims of identity fraud       (the majority of cases having a cyber element), with around one third falling victim to identity       theft and two thirds falling victim to credit or bank card fraud.11    •  A recent survey showed that 54% of New Zealanders feel they know little or nothing at all about                                                     12      computer security risks and solutions.              •  59% of New Zealanders do not secure their mobile phones, PDAs or smart phones by using,       and regularly changing, a password or PIN.13                                                 8  Norton Cybercrime Report 2010: The Human Impact.  9  New Zealand Police – 2011.  10 Ministry of Consumer Affairs – 2010.   11 Department of Internal Affairs – 2010.  12 AVG/NetSafe Survey – March 2011.  13 Unisys Security Index – 2010.

They  are  constantly  targeting  home  users,  businesses  and  government  systems.    Organised  criminals  are  involved  in  activities  such  as  identity  theft,  selling  fake  goods  and  services  and  trading  information with other criminals such as stolen credit card details, passwords and malware.     Criminals are finding increasingly sophisticated ways to gain access to information online. For  example,  as  the  popularity  of  social  networking  sites  increases,  criminals  are  exploiting                                                                                                  14 opportunities  to  use  these  sites  to  access  individuals’  personal  information             .    In  addition  to  obtaining  personal  information,  cyber  criminals  also  seek  to  obtain  intellectual  property  and  government-held information for financial gain.     Social Networking Targets    •  Cyber criminals are increasingly using social networking sites to lure victims to websites that                                                                                        15     attempt to push malware or launch an attack on the victim’s computer.                   •  Attackers exploit the profile information available on social networking sites (e.g. birth dates,      phone numbers, employment details and other information) to mount targeted attacks.16  Cyber Espionage   Some  of  the  most  advanced  and   persistent  cyber  attacks  on  governments  and  critical  infrastructure worldwide are thought to originate from foreign military and intelligence services  or organised criminal groups.  Media organisations around the world are reporting attacks on  government  systems,  national  infrastructure  and  businesses  that  have  resulted  in  access  to  commercially sensitive information, intellectual property and state or trade secrets.    Hacktivism   There  has  also  been  a  global  increase  in  ‘hactivism’.    Hacktivists  seek  to  gain  control  over  computer  systems  or  websites  to  manipulate  them  to  promote  a  cause,  make  a  political  statement or disrupt services, for example, by overloading websites with botnet attacks, which  can deny or prevent the legitimate use of the service.   Terrorist use of the Internet  Terrorists  recognise  the  growing  worldwide  dependence  on  cyber  systems  and  may  seek  to  take advantage of the vulnerabilities that exist.  It is likely that terrorists will continue to develop  their cyber capability and use of the Internet to support recruitment and fundraising activities.                                                  14 Sophos Security Treat Report – 2010.  15 Symantec Internet Security Threat Report: Trends for 2010.  16 As above.

The Strategy highlights initiatives for individuals, businesses and government to  strengthen New Zealand’s cyber security position.     The key objectives of the Strategy are to:          raise   the   cyber   security   awareness   and   understanding   of   individuals   and   small           businesses;           improve the level of cyber security across government; and          build strategic relationships to improve cyber security for critical national infrastructure           and other businesses.  The  Government  has  appointed  the  Ministry  of  Economic  Development  as  the  lead  policy  agency responsible for coordinating cyber security policy and implementing this Strategy.  A Partnership Approach   Improving cyber security is a shared responsibility.  In developing this Strategy, the Government  has  sought  input  from  a  wide  range  of  stakeholders  across  government,  industry,  non- government organisations and academia.    The  Government  will  continue  to  build  partnerships  and  work  with  these  stakeholders  to  implement the initiatives outlined in the Strategy and to explore further opportunities to enhance  New Zealand’s cyber security response.    Internationally, the Government will continue to collaborate with security and trade partners to  ensure New Zealand contributes effectively to global cyber security initiatives.  Priority Areas and Key Initiatives  New Zealand’s Cyber Security Strategy has three priority areas:      1.   Increasing Awareness and Online Security      2.   Protecting Government Systems and Information      3.   Incident Response and Planning  The  Strategy  identifies  key  initiatives,  and  longer-term  initiatives,  under  these  priority  areas.   Implementation of the key initiatives will begin in 2011.    MED1186216                                                                                                              6
