Summary: 

 

The purpose of this document is to generate policy guidelines on cybersecurity1 and 
cyberdefense2 with the aim of developing a national strategy to counter the rise in cyber threats that 
have significant impact on the country. In addition, it examines past experiences, both within the 
country and abroad, as well as the country's legal framework on the subject. 

1. The state’s capacity to minimize the level of exposure of its citizens to cyber threats or incidents. 

2. The state’s capacity to prevent and counter any cyber threat or incident that undermines national 
sovereignty. 

 

The core issue hinges on the fact that the state’s current capacity to confront cyber threats is 
hampered by weaknesses and the lack of a national strategy in this area. Based on the foregoing the 
causes and effects have been identified from which to develop prevention and control policies against 
the increase in cyber threats. In order to enable the strategy's implementation, this document offers 
specific recommendations for entities directly and indirectly involved in this issue. This was the 
position that the Colombian government adopted when it included this issue in the Plan Vive Digital 
[Live Digital Plan] within the framework of the 2010-2014 National Development Plan “Prosperity 
for All.”

I. INTRODUCTION 

 

The use of information and communication technologies brings with it changes and 
permanent threats and has become one of the cornerstones of the globalized world. At the same time, 
the evolution of these technologies has brought an increase in the use of technological resources for 
criminal purposes all over the world. 

The continual evolution, spread, and sophistication of cyber attacks, as well as technological 
convergence,3 highlight the need to adopt measures and controls to protect the state from these new 
threats.4 The increased capacity to commit crime in cyberspace as well as the use of new technologies 
to generate cyber threats, constitute a common concern for all countries, given that they significantly 
impact information security in both public and private spheres, including civil society. 

3. Technological convergence is the tendency for different technological systems to evolve towards 
performing similar tasks. Convergence can refer to previously separate technologies such as voice 
(and telephony features), data (and productivity applications), and video that now share resources and 
interact with each other synergistically (Jenkins, Henry (2006) Convergence Culture, New York 
University Press, New York). 

4. A potential cause of an unwanted incident, which may result in harm to a system or organization. 
(ISO/IEC 13335-1:2004). 

Tackling the issues of cybersecurity and cyberdefense entails a commitment on the part of the 
national government to guarantee information security. Therefore, although this document aims to 
provide a policy framework for the issues of cybersecurity and cyberdefense in particular, the entities 
involved will be responsible for developing that framework and creating mechanisms by which to 
ensure information security nationwide. To achieve the foregoing, consideration will be given to 
technical rules and national and international standards, as well as international initiatives on 
protection of critical infrastructure and cybersecurity. 

Bearing in mind that the government needs to be aware of and act comprehensively against 
cyber threats, a strategy is needed that includes the creation of appropriate bodies to perform the task 
of providing cybersecurity and cyberdefense against any cyber threats or incident that could 


compromise information,5 impair the country's critical infrastructure, and jeopardize the security and 
defense of the state. The adoption of a national policy on cybersecurity and cyberdefense involving 
all sectors of society, under the leadership of the Ministry of Defense and in coordination with other 
state entities, is an imperative of the highest priority. 

5. Cyber threat: The appearance of a potential or actual situation in which an agent has the capacity to 
produce a cyber attack against the population, territory, and political organization of the state. 
(Ministry Of Defense Colombia) 

Cyber incident: One or a series of unexpected or unwanted cybersecurity events that have a significant 
probability of compromising the operations of an entity or threatening information security. (Ministry 
Of Defense Colombia) 

This document identifies as the overarching objective of this policy the strengthening of the 
state’s capacity to confront cyber threats to its security and defense. It also defines three specific 
objectives: 1) To implement appropriate mechanisms to prevent, provide assistance, control, and 
offer recommendations on cyber incidents and/or emergencies for protecting the country's critical 
infrastructure; 2) To design and execute specialized cybersecurity and cyberdefense training plans; 
and, 3) To strengthen the legal framework and law enforcement in this area. 

 

This document sets out a plan of action for putting into effect the policy on cybersecurity and 
cyberdefense, which will be entrusted to the entities involved. 

II. BACKGROUND 

In April 2007, the government of Estonia sustained what is generally regarded as the biggest 
cyber attack in history; it affected the office of the president, the parliament, most ministries, political 
parties, and two major banks. The attack triggered a crisis that necessitated the intervention of the 
international community and alerted NATO. As a result, in August 2008, NATO launched the 
Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence (CCD COE), whose mission is to protect the 
Organization's members from attacks of this type, provide training to military personnel, conduct 
research on electronic defense techniques, and develop a legal framework for pursuing this activity. 


There are two other significant cyber attacks that are also worth mentioning. The first was 
against the United States in July 2009, when a series of attacks affected the White House, the 
Department of Homeland Security (DHS), the Department of Defense, the Federal Aviation 
Administration, and the Federal Trade Commission.6 The other event was that reported by Spain's 
Guardia Civil in March 2010, when it dismantled one of the largest so-called zombie computer 
networks,7 known as the mariposa (or butterfly) botnet8, composed of more than 13 million infected 
IP addresses9 distributed across 190 countries. Colombia was the fifth worst-affected country by this 
network. 

6. Report to Congressional Requesters, United States Government Accountability Office, March 2010, 
http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d10338.pdf 

7. Term used to refer to personal computers which, after being infected by some type of malware, can be 
used by a third party to carry out hostile activities. This use occurs without the consent or knowledge 
of the machine's user. 

8. The name given to a network of computers that combines their resources to perform a common task 
and shares the workload among all the computers (FireEye – Arbornet). A botnet's originator can 
control the infected computers/servers remotely, usually through a means such as IRC: Newer 
versions of these botnets are focusing on control environments via HTTP, greatly simplifying control 
of these machines. Their purposes are usually nefarious. 

9. A numerical label assigned, logically and hierarchically, to the interface (communication/connection 
element) of a device (normally a computer) within a network that uses the IP protocol (Internet 
Protocol). www.iso.org

As regards the private sector, a study found that the average cost to each company that was a 
victim of cyber attacks was US$2 million a year.10 Of the organizations involved, 42% rated 
cybersecurity as their main priority, bearing in mind that 75% of them suffered some form of security 
breach in the 12 months prior to the study. Other factors that were identified as being critical to 
security were staff shortage, new information technology initiatives, and compliance problems with 
information technology standards.11

In Colombia use of information and communication technologies has increased significantly, 
raising the country's level of exposure to cyber threats. According to graph 1, the number of Internet 
users went up by 354% between 2005 and 2009. The number of Internet subscribers increased by 
101% between 2008 and 2010, reaching a total of 4,384,181 fixed and mobile Internet subscribers. 
Of those, 39% are fixed subscribers and 61% are mobile subscribers, as graph 2 shows.

The Internet has become an increasingly popular medium among users of banking services. 
According to the Financial Superintendency of Colombia, in 2010, 30% of financial and non-
financial transactions were carried out online, which, as graph 3 shows, represent an increase of 12% 
in the number of operations carried out using in this way compared with 2008.

The value of financial operations conducted online in 2010 came to 1.237 billion pesos, 
which amounts to a rise of 121% compared to 2008. 

As regards cybersecurity, Colombia has also been the target of attacks. One notable incident 
occurred in the first half of 2011 when the "hacktivist" group that calls itself Anonymous attacked the 
portals of the office of the president, the Senate, the online government portal, and the Ministries of 
the Interior and Justice, Culture, and Defense, leaving their websites off-line for several hours. The 
attack was launched in protest against a proposed law regulating responsibility for online 
infringements of copyright and related rights. This group has indiscriminately targeted public and 
private sector entities, including PayPal, the Swiss bank PostFinance, MasterCard, Visa, and Swiss 
government websites. 

Also worth mentioning are the complaints that have also been reported by private citizens to the 
Colombian police. From January to December 2009, the police dealt with 575 cyber offenses 
recognized by Law 1273 of 2009.12 These offenses included abusive access to a computer system 
(259), computer and related theft (247), data interception (17), violation of personal data (35), 
unauthorized assets transfer (8), website impersonation (5), computer damage (3), and unlawful 
obstruction of a computer system (1). In 2010, the number of offenses and infringements increased 
by 73%, to a total of 995 cyber offenses. The biggest increase came in the area of computer theft, 
where the number rose from 247 to 502,13 equivalent to 103%. 

12 Law 1273 criminalized behavior connected with cyber offenses and information and data protection.

A. National Framework 

In order to put Colombia's legal framework in perspective it is important to mention the 
country's lawmaking efforts in chronological order, as follows: 


 

LAW / 
RESOLUTION 

SUBJECT MATTER 

Law 527 of 1999 
- ELECTRONIC 
TRADE 

Defines and regulates access to and use of data messages, electronic trade, and digital 
signatures, as well as establishing the certification entities and introducing other 
provisions.” 

Law 599 of 2000 

Enacts the Criminal Code. The Law maintains the structure of the definition of the crime of 
"unlawful violation of communications," recognizes copyright as a legal interest, and includes a 
number of conducts indirectly connected with cybercrime, such as the offer, sale, or purchase of 
an instrument apt for use to intercept private communications between persons. The Law also 
defined "Improper access to a computer system" as follows “Art. 195. Anyone who gains 
improper access to a computer system protected with a security measure or remains within 
same against the will of someone entitled to exclude them shall be liable to a fine.” 



 

Law 962 of 2005 

Introduces provisions on streamlining of administrative formalities and procedures of 
government agencies and entities, as well as of private persons who perform public 
functions or provide a public service. Provides for the incentive of using integrated 
technological mechanisms to reduce the time and cost of procedures for those subject to 
administration. 

Law 1150 of 
2007 

Introduces measures to encourage efficiency and transparency in Law 80 of 1993, and 
issues other general provisions on procurement using public funds. In particular, the law 
establishes the possibility for the public administration to issue administrative decisions, 
documents, and notices by electronic means, to which end it provides for the development 
of the Electronic Government Procurement System (SECOP). 

Law 1273 of 
2009 

Amends the Criminal Code and creates a new legally protected interest called information 
and data protection. The Law comprehensively protects systems that use information and 
communication technologies, among other provisions. 

Law 1341 of 
2009 

Defines principles and concepts relating to the information society and the organization of 
information and communication technologies (ICTs). This law also creates the National 
Spectrum Agency as well as issuing other provisions. 




LAW / 
RESOLUTION 

SUBJECT MATTER 

Communications 
Regulation 
Commission 
resolution 2258 of 
2009 

On network security of network providers and telecommunications services. This resolution 
amends Articles 22 and 23 of CRT resolution 1732 of 2007 and Articles 1(8) and 2(4) of 
CRT resolution 1740 of 2007. This rule recognizes the obligation for network providers 
and/or telecommunications services that offer Internet access to implement security models 
in accordance with the specific characteristics and needs of their network, in order to help 
improve the security of their access networks in keeping with the security frameworks 
defined by the ITU, abiding by the principles of data confidentiality, data integrity, and 
availability of network elements, information, services, and applications, as well as 
measures for authentication, access, and non-repudiation. It also establishes obligations to 
be met by network providers and telecommunications services in the area of 
communications inviolability and information security. 

Circular 052 of 
2007 (Financial 
Superintendency 
of Colombia) 

Sets the minimum security and quality requirements on information management through 
goods and services distribution media and channels for clients and users.

personal information" and “credibility and trust in online 
government.” It establishes the following as fundamental 
elements of information security for government agencies: 1) 
Availability of information and services. 2) Information and 
data integrity. 3) Information confidentiality.

In this document the Communications Regulation 
Commission offers the national government 
recommendations for the establishment of a National 
Cybersecurity Strategy; puts suggests suitable public-private 
collaboration and cooperation mechanisms; identifies ways to 
deter cybercrime; recommends the implementation and 
development of cybersecurity legal frameworks consistent 
with international standards; offers recommendations for the 
development of response systems for network security 
incidents, including surveillance, analysis, and incident 
response; and proposes guidelines for introducing a national 
cybersecurity culture in order to improve protection of 
critical information infrastructure in Colombia. 

CSIRT- CCIT - 
Computer Security 
Incident Response Team 
for Internet service 
providers (ISPs). 

Colombian Chamber of 
Informatics and 
Telecommunications 
(CCIT) 

The Colombian Computer Security Incident Response Team, 
which is in direct contact with the security teams of its 
member companies (the largest Internet service providers in 
Colombia). It has the capacity to coordinate attention and 
response to any requests and complaints concerning 
computer security problems that it receives. 



 

Table 3: National initiatives 

 

Furthermore, Colombian government agencies have been raising awareness about the 
importance of developing a cybersecurity and cyberdefense policy since 2007. To that end, the 
national government, in partnership at the international level with the Organization of American 
States (OAS), through the Inter-American Committee against Terrorism (CICTE), organized a 
workshop on cybersecurity awareness in May 2008, followed by a national roundtable in October 
2009. As an upshot of the above activities, government agencies requested the Ministry of Defense to 
lead the way in implementing cybersecurity policies and establish mechanisms to respond to any 
cybercrimes and incidents that might affect the nation. This request arose as a result of the need for 
an in-depth analysis of the specific features of the national security scheme, the technical capabilities 
in place in the Ministry of Defense, and a study of the international context. In the final analysis it 
emerged that the Ministry of Defense had the greatest capacity for handling these issues in an 
efficient and coordinated manner. 

Accordingly, over the last two years, the Ministry of Defense has worked to position the 
issue of cybersecurity and cyberdefense on the national agenda. 


While Colombia does not yet have cyber incident response agencies, it does have capabilities 
and expertise that have allowed it to be a part of commissions that have assisted other governments in 
the region (Panama, Dominican Republic, and Mexico) in planning their respective Computer 
Security Incident Response Teams (CSIRTs). 

Finally, it is noteworthy that the issue of cybersecurity and cyberdefense was included in the 
2010-2014 National Development Plan “Prosperity for All,” as part of the Plan Vive Digital [Live 
Digital Plan] spearheaded by the Ministry of Information and Communication Technologies, the 
purpose of which is to encourage widespread Internet use with the aim of taking a leap toward 
democratic prosperity. 

B. International framework 

The principal international instruments on cybersecurity and cyberdefense are: 

INSTRUMENT 

SUBJECT MATTER 

Council of Europe Convention on 
Cybercrime14 (CCC), also known as 
the Budapest Convention on 
Cybercrime 

Adopted in November 2001; in force 
as of July 1, 2004. 

The main objective of the Convention is the adoption of legislation to 
facilitate the prevention of criminal conduct as well as to contribute 
efficient tools in the area of criminal law with which to detect, 
investigate, and punish unlawful behavior. 

The Convention, together with its additional protocol concerning the 
criminalization of acts of a racist and xenophobic nature committed 
through computer systems, is the only binding international instrument 
in this area. The Council considers that cybercrime requires a 
common criminal policy aimed at the protection of society against 
cybercrime15 , in particular by adopting appropriate legislation and 
strengthening international cooperation. It should be noted that 
although the CCC originated in the European region, it is an 
instrument that is open to all countries for accession. 



14. Any crime committed using a computer or a computer service (Ministry of Defense of Colombia). 

15. Hypothetical or imaginary environment or space of those immersed in the world of electronics, 
informatics, and cybernetics. (Free translation of the definition coined by the Academy of the Spanish 
Language)

AG/RES. 2004 (XXXIV-O/04). 

 

Adoption of a Comprehensive Inter-American Strategy to Combat 
Threats to Cybersecurity: A Multidimensional and Multidisciplinary 
Approach to Creating a Culture of Cybersecurity. 

The Strategy envisages three lines of action: 

. 
Creation of a Hemispheric Network of Computer Security Incident 
Response Teams (CSIRTs).16 This task was assigned to the Inter-
American Committee against Terrorism (CICTE). 
. 
Identification and adoption of technical standards for a secure 
Internet architecture. This task is being carried out by the Inter-
American Telecommunication Commission (CITEL). 
. 
Adoption and/or adaptation of the legal tools necessary to protect 
Internet users and information networks from criminals and 
organized crime groups that exploit these systems. This was 
assigned to the Meeting of Ministers of Justice or Other Ministers 
or Attorneys General of the Americas (REMJA). 


Andean Community Decision 587 
adopted on July 10, 2004 

Which establishes the guidelines of the Andean Common External 
Security Policy. Among others, the objectives of that policy are to 
prevent, combat, and eliminate new security threats and, as 
appropriate, their interactions, through cooperation and coordinated 
measures to confront the challenges that those threats pose to the 
Andean Community.

III. ANALYSIS 

A. Core Problem 

The agencies involved in the preparation of this document have concluded that the current 
capacity of the State to deal with cyber threats has major weaknesses. Despite the existence of 
governmental, private, and civil-society initiatives to counter the impact of such threats, an 
appropriate, coordinated, interagency approach is missing. 

At present, Colombia is one of a number of countries that do not have a national 
cybersecurity and cyberdefense strategy that includes an organizational system and a legal and 
institutional framework strong enough to confront the latest cybersecurity challenges. Unlike the 
majority of Latin American countries, Columbia has not yet implemented a national CSIRT or 
CERT.19 

19. Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT), equivalent to a CSIRT but registered with Carnegie 
Mellon University. 


The increasing number of Internet users, as well as the strong dependence of Colombia's 
critical infrastructure on electronic media and the considerable rise in the number of cybersecurity 
incidents and crimes have highlighted the country's high vulnerability to cyber threats, such as use of 
the Internet for terrorist purposes, sabotage of public services, espionage, and theft, among others. 

B. Effects of the core problem 

The main effects of the above problem are an increase in cybercrime and the risk of 
unauthorized access to information, impairment of the normal operation and continuity of services, 
and ongoing impunity in tackling offenses of this type. 

There are three (3) main problem areas: 

1. Cybersecurity and cyberdefense initiatives and operations are not adequately 
coordinated 

Although a number of institutional efforts exist (in both the private and the public 
sector), the study has found that no agencies have been established at the national 
level to coordinate and implement cybersecurity and cyberdefense operations. 
Accordingly, it has not been possible to establish enough adequate mechanisms to 
curb cyber attacks and protect state interests in cyberspace. Efforts to raise awareness 
and generate a culture of prevention and safety on the issue of cybersecurity in the 
public and private sectors as well as civil society have been weak. 

 

2. Insufficient availability and coverage of specialized training in cybersecurity 
and cyberdefense 

 

Expertise in the areas of cybersecurity and cyberdefense in both the public and the 
private sector is limited. Although a number of higher education institutions in the 
country offer specialty courses in computer security and computer law, the study 
noted that the availability of specialized academic programs in these areas is low. 
Accordingly, a significant number of students who embark on some form of 


education in the area of information security do so by enrolling in programs offered 
by foreign institutions that do not address the Colombian reality in any depth. 

The training and education offered to public- and private-sector employees to 
respond as the first line of defense to cybercrime is deficient. Very often, the chain of 
custody of digital evidence is lost, hampering forensic investigations. Furthermore, 
there are a limited number of training programs available for agencies that serve as 
judicial police in this area. 

3. Weak regulation and legislation on information and data protection. 

In spite of the existence of laws and regulations on information security, 
shortcomings persist that impede a timely response to cyber incidents and offenses. 

The Colombian Congress recently passed the Intelligence and Counterintelligence 
Law, which introduces monitoring and oversight mechanisms for these activities. 
However, this law needs to be made much more specific in terms of scope and 
operability, so that cybersecurity and cyberdefense can be adequately addressed. 

In terms of international standards, one of the instruments that would enable the 
country to draw level with the international community is the Council of Europe's 
Convention on Cybercrime, under which it would have to meet certain requirements, 
such as the establishment of judicial cooperation mechanisms, including extradition, 
points of contact available on a twenty-four hour, seven-day-a-week basis to 
facilitate investigation, and log-keeping20 by ISPs,21 for the requisite amount of time. 

20. A log is an official record of events over a particular period of time. For computer security 
professionals a log serves to keep a record of data or information as to the who, what, when, where, 
and why with regard to an event involving a particular device or an application. 

21. Internet service providers (Currently in Colombia these entities also provide telephony and television 
services, thus becoming providers of integrated telecommunications services.) 

In specific areas, such as ISP regulation, significant progress was made in terms of 
standards toward the end of 2009. The obligation was introduced for ISPs to 


implement security models in keeping with the particular features and needs of their 
networks, with the aim of helping to enhance the security of their access networks, 
complying with the rules on data confidentiality and integrity, as well as availability 
of network elements, information, services and applications, in addition to 
mechanisms for authentication, access and non-repudiation, and obligations in the 
area of in the area of communications inviolability and information security. . It was 
found, however, with regard to ISP network security, for example, that logs are not 
stored for a sufficient length of time, so that, at a given point, they can be used as 
evidence or contribute to cybercrime investigations. 

IV. OBJECTIVES 

A. Overarching Objective 

To strengthen the capabilities the state to confront threats that undermine its security 
and defense in cyberspace (cybersecurity and cyberdefense), creating the necessary 
environment and conditions to provide protection therein. 

This will require the involvement of all government sectors and institutions with 
responsibilities in the area of cybersecurity and cyberdefense, creating an environment of 
participation in which all stakeholders act with a common purpose under consensualized strategies 
and coordinated efforts. It is also vital to inform the public and raise awareness about all aspects of 
information security; strengthen levels of international cooperation and partnership in areas of 
cybersecurity and cyberdefense; support investigations of computer attacks, and protect the public 
from the consequences of those attacks. 

B. Specific objectives 

 

1. To implement appropriate bodies to prevent, provide assistance, control, 
produce recommendations, and issue rules on cyber incidents or emergencies, in 
order to confront threats and risks to national cybersecurity and cyberdefense. 

 


Through this objective, agencies will be established with the necessary technical and 
operating capacity to ensure the country's cybersecurity and cyberdefense. To that 
end, the national government will need to create the following bodies: 

 

Graph 5: Coordination Model 

Source: Ministry of Defense 

a. An Intersectoral Committee charged with devising a strategic vision for 
information management and with introducing policy guidelines for 
technology infrastructure management (hardware, software, and 
communications), public information, and cybersecurity and cyberdefense. 
This committee would be chaired by the President of the Republic and its 
members would include, as a minimum, the Chief Advisor on National 
Security, the Minister of Defense, the Minister of Information and 
Communication Technologies, the Director of the Department of Security 
Administration (DAS) or the entity serving as such, the Director of National 
Planning, and the Coordinator of ColCERT. 



 

Depending on the topics to be addressed, the Committee would also have the 
possibility to invite other national actors representing academia and the 
private sector, as well as international experts and representatives of other 
state institutions. 

 

b. Colombia's Cyber Emergency Response Team (ColCERT) will be the 
agency that coordinates cybersecurity and cyberdefense nationwide. It will 
provide assistance to and work in partnership with other national bodies, 
including the Police Cyber Center (CCP) and the Joint Cyber Command 
(CCOC). 


 

ColCERT will be a Ministry of Defense working group composed of civilian 
officials, military personnel and representatives of other entities. It will 
receive guidelines from the Intersectoral Committee. 

 

ColCERT’s central objective and mission will be to coordinate the necessary 
measures to protect the Colombian state's critical infrastructure against cyber 
emergencies that threaten or compromise national defense and security. 

 

ColCERT will have the following specific objectives: 

• To coordinate, together with the Intersectoral Committee, the 
development and promotion of policies, procedures, 
recommendations, protocols, and guidelines on cybersecurity and 
cyberdefense in concert with the relevant stakeholders, as well as 
ensuring their implementation and compliance. 
• To promote local/sectoral capacity building, as well as the creation 
of sectoral CSIRTs for the operational handling of cybersecurity 
incidents affecting the country's critical infrastructure, the private 
sector, and civil society 



• To coordinate and advise CSIRTs and other entities in the public and 
private sectors, as well as civil society, on computer incident 
response. 
• To offer, on demand, prevention services against cyber threats, 
responses to computer incidents,22 as well as information, 
awareness-building, and training to all entities. 
• To coordinate the implementation of public-private initiatives and 
policies on awareness raising and specialized skills development in 
the areas of cybersecurity and cyberdefense. 
• To provide assistance to government security and investigation 
agencies in prevention and investigation of crimes involving 
information and communication technologies. 
• To foster a knowledge management system in the area of 
cybersecurity and cyberdefense designed to improve the services 
rendered by ColCERT. 
• To provide the CCP and CCOC with computer intelligence 
whenever necessary. 
• To act as international point of contact with its counterparts in other 
countries, and with international agencies involved in this issue. 


22. An unwanted or unexpected event that occurs in cyberspace, which, in different circumstances, can 
harm individuals and affect or cause losses to processes and businesses 

ColCERT is due to start operating in the second half of 2011 within the 
following the relational scheme: 

 


ColCERT Relational Scheme 

 

Graph 6: ColCERT Relational Scheme 

Source: Ministry of Defense 

 

ColCERT will also lead and implement the National Network of CSIRTS 
and Investigation Agencies. The Network will comprise sectoral CSIRTs and 
state investigation bodies, and its purpose will be to facilitate and strengthen 
cooperation and support ties within the country with a view to resolving 
cybersecurity incidents, through a highly secure platform. 

 

c. The Armed Forces Joint Cyber Command (CCOC) will be headed by the 
General Command of the Armed Forces, who will have the authority to 
delegate his functions within the Armed Forces subject to the areas of 
expertise that exist in the sector. It will prevent and counter all cyber threats 
or attacks that affect the country's assets and interests. 



 

The CCOC will have the following general functions: 

 

• To strengthen the technical and operational capabilities of the 
country in order to enable it to confront computer threats and cyber 
attacks through implementation of protection measures at both the 
hardware and software level, as well as introduction of cyberdefense 
protocols. 
• To protect critical infrastructure and reduce the computer risks to the 
country's strategic information, as well as strengthen protection for 
the computer systems of Colombia's security forces. 
• To develop neutralization and response capabilities for dealing with 
computer incidents and attacks against the country's security and 
defense. 


 

The CCOC will follow national guidelines and work in coordination with 
ColCERT. 

 

d. The Police Cyber Center (CCP) will be in charge of cybersecurity in 
Colombian territory, offering information, assistance, and protection against 
cybercrime. Its activities will include prevention, assistance, investigation, 
and prosecution of computer crime in the country, as well as providing 
information about vulnerabilities to cyber attack on its website. It will 
receive and heed the national cybersecurity guidelines and work in 
coordination with ColCERT. 


 

The CCP will consist of a team appointed by the national police, which will 
be in charge of the operational response to cybercrime. The operational 
structure of the CCP will comprise the Virtual Immediate Assistance 
Command (CAI Virtual), a prevention group, an incident management 


group, and an investigation group. The task of CAI Virtual will be to receive 
information and reports of cybercrimes, and to classify the criminal conduct 
found. It may also receive requests for talks, training courses, or visits to 
raise awareness about security issues as it will be in charge of cybercrime 
prevention and awareness building, which will always be carried out in 
coordination with ColCERT. 

 

The CCP will investigate cybercrime and provide support in prosecuting 
cases classified as computer crimes. 

 

In general terms, its functions will be as follows: 

 

• To protect the citizenry from cyber threats/crimes. 
• To respond at the operational level to cybercrime, carrying out 
coordinated efforts in the areas of prevention, assistance, 
investigation, and support for prosecution of computer crime in the 
country. 
• To provide advisory services on vulnerabilities and threats in 
computer systems. 
• To inform the public to enable preventive steps against the loss of 
availability, integrity, and/or confidentiality of information. 
• To provide assistance and investigate, in coordination with 
ColCERT, cyber vulnerabilities, threats and incidents that undermine 
the country's critical computer infrastructure. 
• To foster awareness of cybersecurity policies in partnership with 
stakeholders. 


 

CCP is due to commence operations in 2011. 

 


2. Provide specialized training in information security and broaden lines of 
investigation in cybersecurity and cyberdefense. 

 

This objective will make it possible to generate -and strengthen existing- capacities 
in the area of cybersecurity, so as to be able to deal with threats that undermine the 
proposed aims. 

 

At first, training will be provided to staff directly involved in tackling and managing 
cyber incidents. This training will gradually be extended to all other government 
agencies. As part of its training plans, ColCERT, with support provided by the OAS 
Inter-American Committee against Terrorism (CICTE) and others, will carry out a 
training program for all other civil servants, in addition to implementing awareness 
raising programs for the general public. Similarly, the Ministry of Defense will 
endeavor to phase in theoretical and practical courses on information security, 
cybersecurity, and cyberdefense at officer and NCO training schools. 

 

In the same way, the CCP will seek the collaboration of programs that support the 
implementation of the accusatory oral criminal justice system, such as the 
International Criminal Investigative Training Assistance Program (ICITAP), ATA, 
OPDAT, together with national agencies, such as the School of Criminal 
Investigation, Criminalistics and Forensic Sciences of the Office of the Attorney 
General and the Rodrigo Lara Bonilla Judiciary School, among others, in order to 
introduce legal training programs on computer security for judicial police, 
prosecutors, and judges. 

 

3. Strengthen the cybersecurity and cyberdefense laws, bolster international 
cooperation, and move toward accession by Colombia of the various 
international instruments in this area 

 

The purpose of this objective is to develop the necessary legal tools to ensure 
effective and efficient prevention, investigation, and prosecution of cybercrime. 

 


Thus, moves will be made toward the enactment of the necessary legal framework to 
comply with international treaties in this regard as they are adopted into the 
constitutional body of laws. At the same time, efforts will be made to introduce the 
necessary regulations to implement the country's laws. The institutions responsible 
for cybersecurity and cyberdefense should seek and evaluate their participation in 
different international cooperation networks and mechanisms (Council of Europe, 
OAS, and FIRST), with a view to preparing the country to tackle the increasing 
cybersecurity challenges that exist on the international plane, as well as to respond 
more efficiently to cybersecurity incidents and offenses. 

 

Colombia will face the challenge of positioning itself as a regional leader in the area 
of cybersecurity through exchange of good practices, expertise, and experience, 
giving particular attention to promoting the country's experience in the cybersecurity 
and cyberdefense policy development process. To that end, decision-makers and 
experts on the subject will have to attend international conferences, seminars, and 
specialized meetings to discuss cybersecurity issues. 

 

In order to achieve all of the foregoing, ColCERT and the CCP will have to combine 
their initiatives with those of the private sector and civil society.

VI. FINANCING 

The cost of implementing the cybersecurity and cyberdefense guidelines that ColCERT will 
issue for public-sector entities will also be covered by the budget allocated to each entity. 

 

The initial implementation of ColCERT, the CCP, and the CCOC in the Ministry of Defense 
will entail the following appropriations from the Ministry: 

 

2011 

2012 

2013 

2014 

$ 1,428,444,328 

$ 5,400,000,000 

$ 5,000,000,000 

$ 4,600,000,000 



 

This budget also covers ColCERT operating with a staff of six (6) officials from the Ministry 
of Defense and other public-sector entities.23 Moving forward, ColCERT, with the endorsement of 
the cybersecurity intersectoral coordination mechanism adopted, may consider it necessary to 
increase the size of the group, which would require a revision of the budget included herein and the 
support provided by each entity. 

23. The staff from other public-sector entities will be assigned to the group under a temporary 
commission. 

 

It is important to point out that additional funds will be allocated for 2011 in order to assist 
the General Command of the Armed Forces in implementing the CCOC. 

 

In 2011, the funding for the three centers will be provided by the operating budget. From 
2012 onward, the funding will come from investment in three projects that have already been 
registered in the Investment Projects Bank.
