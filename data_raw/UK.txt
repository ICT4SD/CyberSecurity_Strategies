Introduction by the Rt Hon Francis Maude MP, 

Minister for the Cabinet Office

The growth of the internet has been the biggest
social and technological change of my lifetime. It is
a massive force for good in the world in the way
it drives growth, reduces barriers to trade, and
allows people across the world to communicate
and co-operate. As we saw this spring in the Arab
world, it can help give the unheard a voice and hold
governments to account. It will have a huge role
to play in supporting sustainable development in
poorer countries.
At the same time our increasing dependence on
cyberspace has brought new risks, risks that key
data and systems on which we now rely can be
compromised or damaged, in ways that are hard to
detect or defend against.
The UK Government takes these risks seriously.
That is why the 2010 National Security Strategy
rated cyber attacks as a ‘Tier 1’ threat and why,
despite a tight fiscal situation, we set £650 million
aside over four years to develop our response.
We are determined to tackle the threats, but in
a way which balances security with respect for
privacy and fundamental rights. At home and
internationally the UK Government will continue to
work to ensure that cyberspace remains an open
space – open to innovation and the free flow of
ideas, information and expression.

for UK cyber security firms to leverage strength
at home to sell their products overseas.

•	If you are an individual concerned about your

own personal security from crime, fraud and
identity theft this strategy outlines what we will
do to tackle these threats and ensure you have
the support needed to protect yourself.

In a domain where technology and change are
fast-moving, responding effectively will require
a consistent and extensive effort. By 2015, the
aspiration is that the measures outlined in this
strategy will mean the UK is in a position where:
law enforcement is tackling cyber criminals;
citizens know what to do to protect themselves;
effective cyber security is seen as a positive for
UK business; a thriving cyber security sector has
been established; public services online are secure
and resilient; and the threats to our national
infrastructure and national security have been
confronted.
We will report back next year on progress; in the
meantime I would welcome your feedback on this
strategy and the plan it sets out. Please send your
comments care of the Office of Cyber Security
and Information Assurance in the Cabinet Office
(ocsia@cabinet-office.x.gsi.gov.uk).

This strategy sets out the actions we will take to
reduce the risk and secure the benefits of a trusted
digital environment for businesses and individuals:

we will do to help ensure protection of your
company; to promote the UK as a good place to
do business online; and to foster opportunities

Executive summary


The internet is revolutionising our society by
driving economic growth and giving people
new ways to connect and co-operate with one
another. Falling costs mean accessing the internet
will become cheaper and easier, allowing more
people in the UK and around the world to use it,
‘democratising’ the use of technology and feeding
the flow of innovation and productivity. This will
drive the expansion of cyberspace further and as
it grows, so will the value of using it. Chapter 1
describes the background to the growth of the
networked world and the immense social and
economic benefits it is unlocking.
As with most change, increasing our reliance on
cyberspace brings new opportunities but also new
threats. While cyberspace fosters open markets
and open societies, this very openness can also
make us more vulnerable to those – criminals,
hackers, foreign intelligence services – who want to
harm us by compromising or damaging our critical

data and systems. Chapter 2 describes these
threats. The impacts are already being felt and will
grow as our reliance on cyberspace grows.
The networks on which we now rely for our
daily lives transcend organisational and national
boundaries. Events in cyberspace can happen at
immense speed, outstripping traditional responses
(for example, the exploitation of cyberspace can
mean crimes such as fraud can be committed
remotely, and on an industrial scale). Although we
have ways of managing risks in cyberspace, they do
not match this complex and dynamic environment.
So we need a new and transformative programme
to improve our game domestically, as well as
continuing to work with other countries on an
international response.
Chapter 3 sets out where we want to end up
– with the Government’s vision for UK cyber
security in 2015.

The UK Cyber Security Strategy: Protecting and promoting the UK in a digital world

Our vision is for the UK in 2015 to derive huge economic and social value from a
vibrant, resilient and secure cyberspace, where our actions, guided by our core
values of liberty, fairness, transparency and the rule of law, enhance prosperity,
national security and a strong society.
To achieve this vision by 2015 we want:
Objective 1:

Objective 2:

Objective 3:

The UK to tackle cyber
crime and be one of the
most secure places in the
world to do business in
cyberspace

The UK to be more
resilient to cyber attacks
and better able to
protect our interests
in cyberspace

The UK to have helped
shape an open, stable
and vibrant cyberspace
which the UK public
can use safely and that
supports open societies

Objective 4:
The UK to have the cross-cutting knowledge, skills and capability it needs to 

underpin all our cyber security objectives

That means a UK where:

•	Individuals know how to protect themselves
from crime online.

•	Businesses are aware of the threats they face,

their own vulnerabilities and are working with
Government, trade associations, and business
partners to tackle them. We want to see UK
companies building on our strengths to create
a thriving and vibrant market in cyber security
services around the world. In the current
economic climate the UK needs more than ever
to identify and exploit areas of international
competitive strength to drive growth. We
believe that being able to show the UK is a safe
place to do business in cyberspace can be one
such strength.

•	Government has: sharpened the law

enforcement response to cyber crime; helped
the UK take opportunities to provide the cyber
security services that will be needed across
the world; encouraged business to operate
securely in cyberspace; bolstered defences in
our critical national infrastructure against cyber
attack; strengthened our capabilities to detect
and defeat attacks in cyberspace; enhanced
education and skills; and established and
strengthened working relationships with other
countries, business and organisations around
the world to help shape an open and vibrant
cyberspace that supports strong societies here
and across the globe.

To achieve this we have set aside £650 million
of public funding for a four-year, National Cyber
Security Programme. Chapter 4 sets out what

1. Cyberspace: Driving growth and strengthening
society in the UK and around the world

A networked world...
1.1 The internet and digital technologies are
transforming our society by driving economic
growth, connecting people and providing new ways
to communicate and co-operate with one another.
The World Wide Web only began in 1991, but
today 2 billion people are online1 – almost a third
of the world’s population. Billions more are set to
join them over the next decade. There are over
5 billion internet-connected devices.2 $8 trillion
changed hands last year in online commerce.3
1.2 The internet is already having a profound
impact on the way we live our lives. This social
change will only grow and gather pace as the
number of users increases. Already it looks like
it will be on the scale of the very biggest shifts in
human history, such as the coming of the railways,
or even learning to smelt metals.
Real GDP per capita has risen by $500 over
the last 15 years in mature countries enabled
by the internet. By comparison, it took 50
years for the industrial revolution to have
the same effect.
McKinsey Global Institute, Internet Matters, 2011

...which feeds growth....
1.3 It is easy to see why the growth of the internet
has been so dramatic. Cyberspace is transforming
business, making it more efficient and effective.
It is opening up markets, allowing commerce to
take place at lower cost and enabling people to
do business on the move. It has promoted fresh
thinking, innovative business models and new

sources of growth. It enables companies to provide
better, cheaper and more convenient service to
customers. And it helps individuals to shop around,
compare prices and find what they want.
Cyberspace is an interactive domain made
up of digital networks that is used to store,
modify and communicate information. It
includes the internet, but also the other
information systems that support our
businesses, infrastructure and services.
Digital networks already underpin the supply
of electricity and water to our homes, help
organise the delivery of food and other
goods to shops, and act as an essential
tool for businesses across the UK. And
their reach is increasing as we connect
our TVs, games consoles, and even
domestic appliances.
1.4 Developing countries in particular stand
to benefit as increasing interconnectivity makes
commerce easier and allows access to information,
knowledge and education, enabling people to
innovate, collaborate and compete in global
marketplaces.
Some 52% of UK consumers with access 

to broadband use online shopping as an 

opportunity to save money.

Ofcom, Communications Market Report, 2010

1.5 The UK has positively adopted cyberspace as a
means of doing business. In 2009, 608 million card
payments were made online, with a total spend
of £47.2 billion,4 and in 2011 around 74% of UK

1.6 Recent research suggests that the internet
contributes an average of 3.4% of GDP in a range
of developed countries6. In the UK, the internet
accounts for around 6% of GDP: if it were a sector
in itself it would be larger than either utilities
or agriculture.
1.7 The same research shows that the internet
has also played a vital role in driving prosperity,
accounting for 21% of GDP growth in the last five
years in ‘mature’ countries. Often, small businesses
and traditional industries draw the biggest benefits.
This study also shows that overall moving trade
online has resulted in gains: for every job lost,
2.6 jobs have been created.
1.8 As it has developed, cyberspace has
enabled the automation and optimisation of the
infrastructure that supports many businesses; for
example, the SCADA7 systems that automatically
control and regulate industrial processes such as
manufacturing, water distribution, refining and
power generation.
1.9 Cost savings for governments resulting from
using online services instead of telephone or face­
to-face services are substantial.

... supports open, strong societies...
1.10 Cyberspace also strengthens open societies.
It acts as a vast repository for many forms of
knowledge. It allows individuals to connect with
one another, share ideas and express views,
and take new approaches to shared problems.
It provides new and more effective ways to
participate, allowing larger numbers of people
to solve problems, support each other and get
involved in the issues they care about. As more
people connect to the internet the flow of new
and innovative ideas increases. With a reach that
continues to expand, cyberspace is becoming
‘democratised’ and can now enable social change.
It is now being used to empower people by making
governments more transparent, accountable8 and
efficient in the way they provide public services.9
93% of children aged 12-15 now use the 

internet at home. This group are more 

likely to say they would miss the internet 

than television.

...and which will continue to grow
1.11 Since the 1970s, we have witnessed
remarkable transformational change that has
helped drive the growth of cyberspace. The
amount of information created or replicated using

1. Cyberspace: Driving growth and strengthening society in the UK and around the world

digital technology continues to grow. In 2010 it
was estimated to be 1.2 zetabytes and by 2011
it is predicted to grow to 1.8 zetabytes10 (enough
information to fill 380 billion DVDs). A zetabyte is
a staggeringly large number – a billion terabytes –
where a terabyte is typically the largest hard disk
available for home computers in 2011.
1.12 But in many ways the most exciting
developments in cyberspace are still to come. As
more people and organisations around the world
connect, it becomes more and more useful in a
variety of new and often unexpected ways. The
introduction of cloud computing and smart-grids,
the continued growth of mobile working and the
growth in the number of users of cyberspace each
demonstrate that the pace of change will not let
up: cyberspace will become increasingly valuable
and important to the UK, and to countries across
the world.

15

2. Changing threats


2.1 The internet will become increasingly central
to our economy and our society. But the growing
role of cyberspace has also opened up new threats
as well as new opportunities – we have no choice
but to find ways to confront and overcome these
threats if the UK is to flourish in an increasingly
competitive and globalised world.
2.2 The digital architecture on which we now rely
was built to be efficient and interoperable. When
the internet first started to grow, security was
less of a consideration. However, as we put more
of our lives online, this matters more and more.
People want to be confident that the networks
that support our national security, our economic
prosperity, and our own private lives as individuals
are safe and resilient.
2.3 Unfortunately a growing number of
adversaries are looking to use cyberspace to steal,
compromise or destroy critical data. The scale
of our dependence means that our prosperity,
our key infrastructure, our places of work and
our homes can all be affected. For this reason the
Government’s 2010 National Security Strategy
identified cyber attacks on the UK as a ‘Tier 1’
threat – that is, as one of our highest priorities
for action.

What are the threats?
2.4 Criminals from all corners of the globe
are already exploiting the internet to target the
UK in a variety of ways. There are crimes that
only exist in the digital world, in particular those
that target the integrity of computer networks
and online services. But cyberspace is also being
used as a platform for committing crimes such as

fraud, and on an industrial scale. Identity theft and
fraud online now dwarf their offline equivalents.
The internet has provided new opportunities
for those who seek to exploit children and the
vulnerable. Cyberspace allows criminals to target
the UK from other jurisdictions across the world,
making it harder to enforce the law. As businesses
and government services move more of their
operations online, the scope of potential targets
will continue to grow.
2.5 Some of the most sophisticated threats to
the UK in cyberspace come from other states
which seek to conduct espionage with the aim
of spying on or compromising our government,
military, industrial and economic assets, as well
as monitoring opponents of their own regimes.
‘Patriotic’ hackers can act upon states’ behalf, to
spread disinformation, disrupt critical services or
seek advantage during times of increased tension.
In times of conflict, vulnerabilities in cyberspace
could be exploited by an enemy to reduce our
military’s technological advantage, or to reach past
it to attack our critical infrastructure at home.
2.6 Cyberspace is already used by terrorists to
spread propaganda, radicalise potential supporters,
raise funds, communicate and plan. While
terrorists can be expected to continue to favour
high-profile physical attacks, the threat that they
might also use cyberspace to facilitate or to mount
attacks against the UK is growing. We judge that
it will continue to do so, especially if terrorists
believe that our national infrastructure may be
vulnerable (the recently published CONTEST11
strategy sets out our approach to terrorism).

The UK Cyber Security Strategy: Protecting and promoting the UK in a digital world

2.7 The threat to the UK from politicallymotivated activist groups operating in
cyberspace is real. Attacks on public and private
sector websites and online services in the UK
orchestrated by ‘hacktivists’ are becoming more
common, aimed at causing disruption, reputational
and financial damage, and gaining publicity.
2.8 All these different groups – criminals,
terrorists, foreign intelligence services and
militaries – are active today against the UK’s
interests in cyberspace. But with the borderless
and anonymous nature of the internet, precise
attribution is often difficult and the distinction
between adversaries is increasingly blurred.

Affecting businesses
2.9 Organisations are not always aware of the new
vulnerabilities that dependence on cyberspace can
bring. Intellectual property and other commercially
sensitive information (for example, business
strategies) can be attractive targets. This risks
undermining the strengths of the UK’s research
base and intellectual property as important drivers
of growth. Services relying on, or delivered via,
cyberspace can be taken offline by criminals or
others, damaging revenue and reputations.
In the spring of 2011, Sony announced
that criminals had successfully targeted
the PlayStation network, compromising
the personal details of up to 100 million
customers and resulting in the network
shutting down for several weeks. The costs
to Sony are expected to total $171 million.
2.10 As the digital connections between
organisations and individuals proliferate (for
example through shared or sub-contracted
services), incidents can affect larger numbers of
individuals and organisations. Recent research
suggests that the costs to the UK of cyber crime
could be in the order of £27 billion per year12.
A truly robust estimate will probably never be
established, but it is clear the costs are high and
rising. Cyber criminals have demonstrated their
ability to adjust quickly to new developments like
smart-phones (see graph above). The collective
impact of this threat now has the potential to
cause significant damage to online economies.

2.11 The chart below demonstrates the growing
impact of information security incidents on
businesses worldwide. Maintaining confidence
in e-commerce as a viable way of doing business
is crucial. Investors, businesses, government and
particularly customers each need to be confident
that networks are safe to use if the UK is to realise
its full potential for growth.

2.12 But staying secure in cyberspace can seem
complex, difficult and expensive. Without a clear
and shared understanding of the nature and scale
of threats and vulnerabilities, the case for investing
in protection and prevention can be undermined.

2. Changing threats

Affecting our security
2.13 Cyberspace has now grown to become a
domain where strategic advantage – industrial
or military – can be won or lost. It underpins the
complex systems used by commerce (for example,
banking, the delivery of food and the provision of
utilities such as power and water) and the military.
The growing use of cyberspace means that its
disruption can affect nations’ ability to function
effectively in a crisis.
Nearly two-thirds of critical infrastructure 

companies report regularly finding malware 

designed to sabotage their systems.

McAfee, Critical infrastructure protection report, 

March 2011


2.14 Some states regard cyberspace as providing
a way to commit hostile acts ‘deniably’. Alongside
our existing defence and security capabilities, the
UK must be capable of protecting our national
interests in cyberspace.
“There are over 20,000 malicious emails on
government networks each month, 1,000 of
which are deliberately targeting them.”
Iain Lobban, Director of Government Communications 

Headquarters, 2010


These kinds of attack are increasing; the 

number of emails with malicious content 

detected by government networks in the 

whole of 2010 was double the number 

seen in 2009.

Cabinet Office, 2011

Affecting individuals and societies
2.15 In order to get the most from the internet, it
is important that people feel confident that it can
be used safely. As all of us make more use of the
internet in our work and private lives it makes for a
more attractive target for criminals or others. Any
reduction in trust towards online communications
can now cause serious economic and social harm
to the UK.

2.16 Beyond the impact on individuals, the scale
of the use of cyberspace means that it can now
also affect society more broadly. We have a strong
tradition in the UK of protecting our citizens in
ways that are guided by core values of liberty,
fairness, transparency and the rule of law. These
values help define who we are, what we do and
what it means to be British. The interconnected
nature of cyberspace and its expansion mean that
it has developed to promote many of these values.
2.17 The conventions and norms covering
conduct within the cyber domain are still
developing. While this helps make it the vibrant
domain that it is today, it can also cause instability
and uncertainty about accountability. The blurring
of boundaries in cyberspace increases the risk of
actions affecting larger numbers of people and
organisations unintentionally. At its most serious,
this leads to the potential for unpredictable and
large-scale shocks.
2.18 Actions to strengthen our national security
must also be consistent with our obligations, such
as those concerning freedom of expression; the
right to seek, receive and impart ideas; and the
right to privacy. Defending security should be
consistent with our commitment to uphold civil
liberties. Of course, these are well-established and
ongoing debates, but cyberspace can bring them
into focus in new ways, and more quickly than in
other areas.
2.19 These changes do not affect the UK
alone. We believe that the global reach of the
internet and digital technologies can provide
an important means for the spread of ideas,
with profound implications for societies. But
like any communications medium, cyberspace
can also potentially be used to restrict liberty
and undermine freedoms. Some states and
organisations are already seeking to control and
restrict the future development of the cyber
domain. These attempts are ultimately doomed
to fail. But for as long as they last they are holding
back progress and reducing social benefit. The
UK will continue to work with like-minded states
around the world to maximise the extent to which
the world can fully realise and enjoy the benefits
that cyberspace will offer.

The UK Cyber Security Strategy: Protecting and promoting the UK in a digital world

A complex problem
2.20 The growing adoption of the internet and
new uses of digitally connected technologies make
for a fast moving and complex environment, which
brings its own challenges:

•	Cyberspace is largely commercially owned and
driven, and global in nature.

•	The systems that form cyberspace contain

a vast array of components, sourced from a
global and diverse range of suppliers. Multiple
sub-contractors produce, test, package and
assemble these components.

•	Predicting and understanding how cyberspace
will be used in future is difficult given the rate of
innovation and change.
•	New vulnerabilities and risks will emerge
suddenly.

•	The pace of events can make existing defences

and responses look slow and inadequate. Along
with the complexity of cyberspace, this makes
attributing hostile actions difficult.

•	The covert nature of the threat means that

the public and businesses can underestimate
the risks.

Existing capacity to meet the challenge
2.21 In tackling these problems we are not
starting from scratch. The UK is well placed to
respond to many of the challenges that cyberspace
presents. Our private sector, key government
agencies, and academia all have world-leading
strengths in cyberspace; we must bring these
together to capitalise on the opportunities and get
the most for the UK:

•	Some of the specific technical and specialist

expertise needed to help us achieve our cyber
security objectives already exists in the UK.

•	In particular GCHQ, the Government’s signals

intelligence agency, has some world-class skills at
its disposal.

•	We already have some businesses with strengths
in cyber security.

•	Information assurance already plays an

important role in reducing our vulnerabilities
in cyberspace.

2.22 But government capacity, though it includes
these real strengths, is not sufficient or sufficiently
scaled to meet the growing security challenges
of the digital age. Although government already
provides advice to organisations that run our
infrastructure on how to manage the risks in
cyberspace, the adoption of this approach needs
to be broader. Our current capacity to enforce the
law is too distributed, meaning that criminals still
regard exploiting cyberspace as a profitable and
low-risk option.
2.23 As for business, some firms recognise the
growing scale and impact of the risks. However,
some sectors of the economy, particularly small
and medium sized businesses, do not have access
to the skills and knowledge to protect themselves
online. We need to improve our understanding of
the threat across the board and manage it more
effectively. This can mean relying upon skills and
knowledge, not often found in the same place.

•	Our sound domestic legal framework and

2.24 We also recognise that there are challenges
in ensuring that the public has access to the
information and skills they require in order
to understand the threat and take actions to
operate safely online. More needs to be done to
ensure that the current provision of information
is coordinated across Government, and with the
private sector.

•	The UK already has ways to exchange information

2.25 We do have a body of internationally agreed
principles, behaviour and law which applies to
cyberspace. The International Covenant on Civil
and Political Rights sets out some of the key
obligations. But there remains more to be done

•	The UK has strong international alliances based
on shared values and common interests.

the basis to respond to cyber crime and similar
threats to the UK. We need to promote a
similar environment internationally.
with the private sector on the risks emerging
from cyberspace, and to tackle cyber crime.

2. Changing threats

with other countries to establish the practical
implications of applying existing principles to
cyberspace. At a practical level, not all countries
have appropriate legislation to allow them to
work together to tackle threats from crime in
cyberspace.
2.26 The technical capabilities that enable a
wide range of actions to protect the UK need
strengthening. But it is clear that our approach
to the risks in cyberspace must not rely on
technical measures alone. Changes in attitudes and
behaviours will also be crucial to operating safely
in cyberspace.
2.27 It is clear that cyberspace is changing the
world. The huge benefit that this brings also means
new vulnerabilities. This dynamic and changing
profile of risk demands a new approach.

3. A vision for UK cyber security in 2015


3.1 In order to secure the vast economic and
social benefits that cyberspace will offer the UK
we will transform our approach to cyber security.
This section sets out our vision for the UK in 2015

and identifies the principles that will shape our
work. The next chapter shows how we will use
our existing strengths and the new National Cyber
Security Programme to achieve our goals.

Our vision
Our vision is for the UK in 2015 to derive huge economic and social value from a
vibrant, resilient and secure cyberspace, where our actions, guided by our core values
of liberty, fairness, transparency and the rule of law, enhance prosperity, national
security and a strong society.
Our objectives
Our objectives are for:
Objective 1:

Objective 2:

Objective 3:

The UK to tackle cyber
crime and be one of the
most secure places in the
world to do business in
cyberspace

The UK to be more
resilient to cyber attacks
and better able to
protect our interests
in cyberspace

The UK to have helped
shape an open, stable
and vibrant cyberspace
which the UK public
can use safely and that
supports open societies

Objective 4:
The UK to have the cross-cutting knowledge, skills and capability it needs to
underpin all our cyber security objectives

22

The UK Cyber Security Strategy: Protecting and promoting the UK in a digital world

Our principles:
A risk-based approach....
3.2 In a globalised world where all networked
systems are potentially vulnerable and where cyber
attacks are difficult to detect, there can be no such
thing as absolute security. We will therefore apply a
risk-based approach to prioritising our response.
....working in partnership...
3.3 Though the scale of the challenge requires
strong national leadership, Government
cannot act alone. It must recognise the limits
of its competence in cyberspace. Much of the
infrastructure we need to protect is owned and
operated by the private sector. The expertise and
innovation required to keep pace with the threat
will be business-driven.
3.4 Similarly, though we can improve our defences
domestically, the internet is fundamentally
transnational. Threats are cross-border. Not all the
infrastructure on which we rely is UK-based. So
the UK cannot make all the progress it needs to
on its own. We will seek partnership with other
countries that share our views, and reach out
where we can to those who do not.
... balancing security with freedom and privacy
3.5 At home we will pursue cyber security policies
that enhance individual and collective security
while preserving UK citizens’ right to privacy and
other fundamental values and freedoms.
3.6 Internationally the UK will continue to
pursue the development of norms of acceptable
behaviour in cyberspace. We start from the
belief that behaviour which is unacceptable offline
should also be unacceptable online. Our position
will be guided by the principles proposed by the
Foreign Secretary in February 2011 and reiterated
at the London Conference on Cyberspace this
November:

•	The need for governments to act
proportionately in cyberspace and in accordance
with national and international law.
•	The need for everyone to have the ability – in
terms of skills, technology, confidence and
opportunity – to access cyberspace.

•	The need for users of cyberspace to show

tolerance and respect for diversity of language,
culture and ideas.

•	The need to ensure that cyberspace remains

open to innovation and the free flow of ideas,
information and expression.

•	The need to respect individual rights of privacy

and to provide proper protection to intellectual
property.

•	The need for us all to work collectively to tackle
the threat from criminals acting online.

•	The promotion of a competitive environment
which ensures a fair return on investment in
network, services and content.

Roles and responsibilities
3.7 Achieving this vision will require everybody,
the private sector, individuals and government to
work together. Just as we all benefit from the use
of cyberspace, so we all have a responsibility to
help protect it.
Individuals
3.8 Ordinary people have an important role to
play in keeping cyberspace as a safe place to do
business and live our lives. By 2015 we want a
UK where:

•	People know how to get themselves a basic level
of protection against threats online. They have
access to accurate and up to date information
on the online threats that they face, and the
techniques and practices they can employ to
guard against them.

•	Individuals are careful about putting personal or

sensitive information on the internet; are wary
of email attachments or links from unrecognised
senders; and are cautious about downloading
files from websites they know little about.

•	Everyone, at home and at work, can help

identify threats in cyberspace and report them –
for example, identifying fraudulent websites.

•	Individuals play their part in transacting safely
with businesses and Government, protecting
passwords, understanding the importance

3. A vision for UK cyber security in 2015

of updating software and operating systems
regularly and running anti-malware programs
to help prevent their computers being used by
others to increase the threat.

•	People are clear that, as in the offline world,
we are each responsible for our behaviour in
cyberspace (including those who harass others,
commit crime or ‘hack’ into systems for publicity
or to cause disruption).
The private sector
3.9 The private sector has a crucial role to play
in the UK’s cyber security. Much of cyberspace
is owned and used by private companies. It is
businesses that will drive the innovation required
to keep pace with security challenges. By 2015 we
want a UK where:

•	Companies are aware of the threat and use

cyberspace in a way that protects commercially
sensitive information, intellectual property and
customer data.

•	Private organisations work in partnerships with

each other, Government and law enforcement
agencies, sharing information and resources,
to transform the response to a common
challenge, and actively deter the threats we face
in cyberspace (the work of the UK Council for
Child Internet Safety offers a good example of
what can be achieved).

•	Companies capitalise on the growth in demand

in the UK and globally for vibrant and innovative
cyber security services.

•	The private sector has built upon the strengths

of the UK’s skills base in cyber security to invest
and create centres of excellence to provide the
cyber security skills we will need in future.

Government
3.10 Government will play its part in achieving
these aims. By 2015 we want a UK where we have:

•	Built up our capacity to detect and defeat
high-end threats.

•	Helped shape an international consensus on
‘norms of behaviour’ in cyberspace.

•	Reduced vulnerabilities in government systems
and our critical national infrastructure.

•	Grown the cadre of cyber security professionals.
•	Strengthened law enforcement and tackled
cyber crime.

•	Improved prevention and public awareness.
•	Raised business awareness.
•	Seized the business opportunities – working

with industry and academia to boost our share
of the cyber security market and cemented the
UK’s status as a safe place to do business online.

3.11 The next section sets out how we will work
with partners to achieve this vision.

4. Action: Meeting threats, taking opportunities


4.1 As one of the outcomes of its Strategic
Defence and Security Review13 in 2010 the
Government put in place a £650 million, four-year
National Cyber Security Programme (NCSP). This
funding is intended to transform the Government’s
response to cyber threats, and has been allocated
to those departments and agencies that have key
roles to play.
4.2 The intelligence agencies and Ministry
of Defence have a strong role in improving
our understanding of – and reducing – the
vulnerabilities and threats that the UK faces in
cyberspace. GCHQ in particular is central to this
effort. But the Home Office, the Cabinet Office
and BIS are also receiving funding to bolster
their specific individual capabilities. As set out in
Chapter 3, outreach to business and the public is

crucial. With the rise of cyber crime what was a
concern primarily for the defence and intelligence
elements of government is now something that
concerns us all.
4.3 The NCSP is managed and co-ordinated on
behalf of Government by the Office of Cyber
Security and Information Assurance in the Cabinet
Office, under the oversight of the Minister for the
Cabinet Office. Allocations to departments for
later years are provisional and can be adjusted if
experience suggests that a different mix of inputs
will produce better results.
4.4 Working through departments and their
partners in business, civil society and internationally
the NCSP will deliver on the following priorities.
We will report on progress in a year’s time.

The UK Cyber Security Strategy: Protecting and promoting the UK in a digital world

Priorities for action
4.5 We will build on the UK’s existing strengths as
follows:

•	We will continue to improve our detection and

analysis of sophisticated cyber threats, with a
focus on the UK’s critical national infrastructure,
and other systems of national interest.

•	As part of this we will pool knowledge and
situational awareness as appropriate with
partners across business to build a genuinely
national response.
•	We will enhance our capability to defend against

and deter high-end, state-sponsored threats, and
to prevent these techniques becoming available
to non-state actors.

•	We will work internationally to develop

international principles or ‘rules of the road’ for
behaviour in cyberspace. We will work with
other countries on practical confidence-building
measures to reduce the risk of escalation and
avoid misunderstandings.

•	The UK has ratified the Budapest Convention

on cyber crime and will work to persuade other
countries to develop compatible laws, so that
cyber crimes can be prosecuted across borders
and cyber criminals are denied safe havens.

•	At home we will maintain an effective legal

framework and enforcement capabilities to
disrupt and prosecute cyber crime. We will
make it easier to report cyber crime and ensure
that the intelligence from reporting is fed back
into effective action and advice to the public.
Where appropriate we will use cyber-relevant
sanctions to tackle cyber crimes like online
bullying or internet scams.

•	We will model best practice on cyber security

in the Government’s own systems, setting strong
standards for suppliers to government to ensure
we raise the bar.

•	We will promote the development of a cadre

of skilled cyber security professionals so that
the UK continues to retain an edge in this area,
together with the underlying research and
development to keep producing innovative
solutions.

•	Because prevention is key, we will work to raise

awareness and to educate and empower people
and firms to protect themselves online. 80%
or more of currently successful attacks exploit
weakness that can be avoided by following
simple best practice, such as updating anti­
malware software regularly.

•	We will create a thriving market in cyber

security products and services that can win the
UK business abroad and contribute to growth. It
will also enable us to promote the UK as a good
place to do business in cyberspace.

Building capacity to deter and defend against
high-end threats
4.6 The 2010 NATO Lisbon Summit highlighted
the cyber domain as an area of significant new
risk and opportunity for the Alliance. The new
Strategic Concept committed the Alliance to:
“develop further our ability to prevent, detect,
defend against and recover from cyber-attacks,
including by using the NATO planning process
to enhance and coordinate national cyberdefence capabilities, bringing all NATO bodies
under centralized cyber protection, and better
integrating NATO cyber awareness, warning and
response with member nations”.
4.7 In keeping with the NATO Strategic Concept,
and with the agreement of the National Security
Council, the NCSP is investing to ensure we take a
more proactive approach to tackling cyber threats
and exploiting the cyber environment for our own
national security needs.
4.8 In the Ministry of Defence, investment in
ensuring military networks and equipment are
protected against cyber attack is already underway.
The new Joint Forces Command will take the lead
in the development and integration of defence
cyber capabilities from April 2012.
4.9 As part of this we are creating a new Defence
Cyber Operations Group to bring together cyber
capabilities from across defence. The group will
include a Joint Cyber Unit hosted by GCHQ at
Cheltenham whose role will be to develop new
tactics, techniques and plans to deliver military
effects, including enhanced security, through

4. Action: Meeting threats, taking opportunities

operations in cyberspace. We will also consider
the future contribution of reservists in bringing in
specialist cyber knowledge and skills.
4.10 The Ministry of Defence has recently opened
a new Global Operations and Security Control
Centre, located at Corsham, to act as a focus for
cyber defence for the armed forces. A second
Joint Cyber Unit embedded within the centre at
Corsham will develop and use a range of new
techniques, including proactive measures, to
disrupt threats to our information security.
4.11 The Ministry of Defence is also strengthening
relations with key allies and with industry to
improve our collective awareness of and response
to cyber threats, vulnerabilities and incidents.
4.12 Around half of the £650 million funding will
go towards enhancing the UK’s core capability,
based mainly at GCHQ at Cheltenham, to detect
and counter cyber attacks. The details of this work
are necessarily classified, but it will strengthen and
upgrade the sovereign capability the UK needs to
confront the high-end threat.
Working to build international consensus on
proportionality in cyberspace
4.13 At the same time we will work internationally
to develop international principles or ‘rules of the
road’ for behaviour in cyberspace.
4.14 As a start, the UK believes that all
governments must act proportionately in
cyberspace and in accordance with national
and international law. This includes respect for
intellectual property and for fundamental human
rights to freedom of expression and association.
4.15 The UK has already set a lead in this area
with the London Conference on Cyberspace in
November 2011. It will continue to work in the
UN and other international fora on the agenda set
out in London, to develop norms of acceptable
behaviour. We are clear that the debate must
involve all those with a stake in an open, trusted
and stable cyberspace, including industry, business
and representatives of civil society.
4.16 Meanwhile the UK will work actively in
the UN and with organisations such as the
Organisation for Security and Cooperation in
Europe (OSCE) to develop practical confidence­

building measures to reduce the risk of escalation
and avoid misunderstandings between states
arising from unexpected incidents in cyberspace.
In February 2011 the Foreign Secretary 

called for ‘rules of the road’ for behaviour 

in cyberspace, and for a more focussed and 

inclusive dialogue between all those with 

a stake in the internet – civil society and 

industry as well as governments – on how 

we might implement them.

On 1-2 November that more focussed 

debate was begun at the London Conference 

on Cyberspace. This brought together 

Ministers, senior government officials, 

industry leaders, and representatives of 

the internet technical community and civil 

society. In all, more than 700 participants 

from 60 countries took part. There was 

also a lively online debate around the 

Conference, with citizens from across 

the world following the debate in real 

time through livestreaming, and feeding 

in questions and issues through the Web. 

The agenda set out in London will now 

go forward over the next 24 months with 

conferences in 2012 and 2013, hosted by 

Hungary and South Korea respectively, to 

take stock.

Reducing vulnerabilities in government systems
and our critical infrastructure
4.17 The Government ICT Strategy sets out how
Government is working to make its own critical
data and systems secure and resilient. We will
work with industry to develop rigorous cyber
security and IA standards for ICT products and
services supplied to Government and its Public
Services Network. In particular we will raise
the standard of cyber security we expect from
suppliers for sensitive defence equipment. Just
as we already place certain requirements on
contractors’ physical security, it now also makes
sense to look again at our requirements on cyber
security, as the means through which attempts
to steal data are now most likely to come. The
Ministry of Defence is leading on the approach
to managing risks to Government information
through the ICT Strategy, strengthening risk

27

28

The UK Cyber Security Strategy: Protecting and promoting the UK in a digital world

management governance and building on the
progress Government has already made in the
oversight of Information Assurance.
4.18 The UK is about to see a big expansion of
public services online as the Government rolls
out its ‘digital by default’ agenda. Many of these
services will migrate to cloud computing in due
course, and Government recently published a
Cloud Computing Strategy14 setting out how
this shift will be effected without compromising
security. This is the right thing to do to improve
efficiency and service delivery to customers.
But we need to make sure that these services
are safe and resilient against fraud and cyber
attack. Government is rationalising the numerous
technology platforms used to deliver Government
services. This will also enable increased protection
and improve protective monitoring. We will set
targets for the speed with which systems apply
security patches to all of their supported software
and machines. To ensure that service users can
be identified and fraud prevented, the NCSP is
funding work on a trusted and resilient approach
to identity assurance and other supporting
measures.
4.19 Of course much of the UK’s critical
infrastructure is not in Government hands but is
owned and managed by the private sector. CPNI
(see box) is already working with a network of
critical national infrastructure companies to ensure
that they take the necessary steps to protect key
systems and data.
The Centre for the Protection of National
Infrastructure delivers advice that aims to
reduce the vulnerability of organisations
in the national infrastructure to terrorism
and other threats such as espionage,
including those from cyberspace. It
has built up strong partnerships with
private sector organisations across the
national infrastructure, creating a trusted
environment where information can
be shared for mutual benefit. Direct
relationships are augmented by an extended
network, which includes other Government
departments and professional service
organisations.

4.20 Government will now work to scale up this
approach to reach a wider group of companies
not currently deemed part of the critical
infrastructure, but where the threat to revenues
and intellectual property is capable of causing
significant economic damage to the UK. CPNI will
be critical to this effort through the NCSP-funded
Cyber Protection Priorities outreach work.
4.21 A cyber security ‘hub’ (see below) is being
established to make sure this wider group can
draw on actionable information on threats and
what can be done to counter them.

Responding in partnership: the cyber
security ‘hub’
In February 2011 the Prime Minister met the
heads of some of the largest companies from
all sectors of the UK economy to discuss
the cyber threat and our shared interest in
getting the response right.
In the months since, the private sector
and Government have come together to
design and build an innovative new approach
focused on:
•  exchanging actionable information on cyber
threats and strengthening our response to
incidents
•  analysing new trends and identifying new
and emerging threats and opportunities
•  working to strengthen and link up our
collective cyber security capabilities.
A joint public/private sector ‘hub’ will pool
government and private threat information
and pass that out to ‘nodes’ in key business
sectors, helping them identify what needs
to be done and providing a framework for
sharing best practice. A pilot will commence
in December involving five business sectors:
defence, finance, telecommunication,
pharmaceuticals, and energy. Lessons from
this will be used to inform roll-out of the
initiative to other sectors from March 2012.
We will also establish the best way to make
sure that SMEs are also aware of the threats
and benefit from the cyber security ‘hub’.

4. Action: Meeting threats, taking opportunities

Encouraging a cadre of cyber security professionals
4.22 The pace of technological change is
relentless. Keeping pace will require people who
have a deep understanding of cyberspace and how
it is developing. But these people are currently
a scarce resource across Government and in
business. There are clear and authoritative voices
warning that cyber security skills and expertise
in the private sector will be increasingly sought
after, and that business and providers of education
and training need to respond. To help boost
and maintain the pool of experts in the UK and
encourage the development of a community of
‘ethical’ hackers in the UK who can help ensure our
networks are well protected, the National Cyber
Security Programme will:

•	Drive up the skill levels of information assurance
and cyber security professionals by establishing
programmes of certified specialist training by
March 2012.

•	Continue to support the Cyber Security

Challenge (see below) as a way of bringing new
talent into the profession.

•	Strengthen postgraduate education to expand

the pool of experts with in-depth knowledge of
cyber.

•	Strengthen the UK’s academic base by

developing a coherent cross-sector research
agenda on cyber, building on work done by the
Government Office for Science.

•	Establish, with GCHQ’s help, a research institute
in cyber security, with an indicative budget of
£2 million over 3.5 years.

•	Commissioning research clarifying the extent,
pattern and nature of the demand for cyber
security skills across the private sector.

From postman to cyber expert
The UK will need cyber security experts
with technical skills and an aptitude for
problem solving and investigation. Cyber
Security Challenge runs challenging
competitions with a diverse range of
entrants to help identify talented individuals.
A recent winner was working as a postman,
but now works as an information security
professional for the Royal Mail.
Cyber crime and law enforcement
4.23 What is illegal offline is illegal online. We
will ensure the UK has a robust legal framework
that enables law enforcement agencies to tackle
cyber crime.
4.24 Because cyberspace allows criminals to
operate from around the world, we are working
to encourage wider adoption of the Budapest
Convention on cyber crime, putting in place
compatible frameworks of law that enable
effective cross-border law enforcement and
deny safe havens to cyber criminals. We will
make progress on this a key element of the UK’s
chairmanship of the Council of Europe over the
next 12 months.
4.25 While having the right legislation in place
is essential, this must also be supported by a
willingness to act when called upon. We need
practical collaboration and capacity development
on cross-border law enforcement, to take place
at a rapid pace that reflects the reality of the
networked world. The UK is a strong supporter
of the network of law enforcement contact points
known as the ‘24/7 Network’ as the best means to
make sure that when urgent assistance is required,
partner countries are able to obtain it. The UK
will work with other countries to encourage
them to join the 24/7 Network and to put in the
commitment to make it a success. The Serious
Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) already has
liaison officers around the world.
4.26 We also need to make sure that we are able
to respond robustly here in the UK. At home we
are reviewing the UK’s own Computer Misuse
Act to ensure it is fit for purpose in an area of

29

30

The UK Cyber Security Strategy: Protecting and promoting the UK in a digital world

fast-moving technological change. If amendments
are needed, proposals for these will be brought
forward as soon as possible.
4.27 The Government will also work to ensure
that law enforcement agencies and the judiciary are
aware of the additional powers the courts already
have to protect the public when there is strong
reason to believe someone is likely to commit
further serious cyber crime offences. Computer
use may be monitored or restricted under licence
conditions when an offender is released, or through
a Serious Crime Prevention Order (under the
Serious Crime Act 2007). For example an internet
fraudster can be prevented from offering goods
for sale online. Other orders which may include
restrictions on internet use are used to protect
the public or victims in cases of sexual offences,
harassment and anti-social behaviour. Through
guidance we will encourage the judicial system to
consider these cyber-relevant sanctions for cyber
offences wherever appropriate.
4.28 In addition, the Ministry of Justice and
the Home Office will consider and scope the
development of a new way of enforcing these
orders, using ‘cyber-tags’ which are triggered by
the offender breaching the conditions that have
been put on their internet use, and which will
automatically inform the police or probation
service. If the approach shows promise we will
look at expanding cyber-sanctions to a wider
group of offenders.
4.29 As well as broadening the powers at their
disposal, we are also helping law enforcement
agencies tighten up its operational response.
As part of the creation of the National Crime
Agency (NCA), we will create a new national
cyber crime capability, drawing together the
work currently carried out by the e-crime unit
in SOCA and the Metropolitan Police’s Central
E-Crime Unit. The new unit will underpin the
work of all four operational commands of the
NCA (borders, organised crime, economic crime
and Child Exploitation and Online Protection –
CEOP) by providing specialist support, intelligence
and guidance.
4.30 The unit will act as the national capability to
deal with the most serious national-level cyber

crime, and to be part of the response to major
national incidents. The NCA will continue the
good work of SOCA and the Metropolitan Police
in finding ways to disrupt criminal activity even
where – because of cross-border jurisdictional
issues – convictions are unlikely. We will also
use cyber techniques to disrupt other types of
organised crime.
4.31 The NCA will also support police forces
across England and Wales to drive up wider
national capability on cyber crime, including
through shaping the training for mainstream law
enforcement on cyber issues, and making sure
the links to related issues such as bullying or child
exploitation are made. A key area will be ensuring
the best possible flow of information between
police forces and the NCA. The Government will
look closely at the way intelligence (for example,
on threats to children provided by CEOP) is used
by forces and how the outcome of action by forces
and the courts is fed back to develop the best
possible picture on threats. As part of our work
to build strong relationships between the police,
business and communities, we will encourage
the transfer of skills between these sectors. The
Metropolitan Police’s Police Central E-crime Unit
has made groundbreaking use of Police Specials
with relevant specialist skills to help tackle cyber
crime: we will encourage all police forces to make
use of such ‘cyber-specials’. We will involve people
from outside law enforcement to help tackle cyber
crime as part of the NCA cyber crime unit.
4.32 The increase in e-commerce, and use of
networked technologies to underpin all elements
of business make it an increasingly attractive
target for criminals. Businesses have a key role in
combating this kind of crime. We will learn from
the success we have had in tackling online threats
to children by bringing industry, law enforcement
and government in the UK Council for Child
Internet Safety (UKCCIS). We will introduce a
similar forum, led by Ministers, to bring together
a wide range of groups to develop cross-sector
working on cyber crime. This forum will help
drive forward work on designing out crime online,
developing best practice for security, and effective
crime prevention advice for all levels of business.

4. Action: Meeting threats, taking opportunities

4.33 In parallel we are taking action to make sure
that it is simple and straightforward for members
of the public to report cyber crimes. Of course
this should include being able to do so online.
4.34 Over half of all police forces already provide
a facility for the public to report crime online,
though these range from basic systems for certain
crime types to fully integrated crime reporting
tools. We will support forces to move to full
online crime reporting by helping them identify
good practice.
4.35 People are already encouraged to report
fraud, including cyber fraud, through the internet,
using the Action Fraud tool. We will make it easier
for people to do this by improving its accessibility
and functionality. Crime reports can currently take
up to 30 minutes to complete online. We will aim
to reduce that time by a half.
4.36 As well as allowing the police to follow up
directly on individual crimes, better reporting will
help build our intelligence picture through the
National Fraud Intelligence Bureau, improving the
targeting of enforcement resources and feeding
into crime prevention advice.
Prevention and public awareness
4.37 Prevention is key. Most common cyber
incidents could be prevented by quite simple
‘cyber hygiene’. GCHQ estimates that 80% or
more of currently successful attacks are defeatable
by simple best practice, such as updating anti-virus
software regularly.
4.38 In order to help people protect themselves
we will:

•	Help consumers respond to the cyber threats
that will be the ‘new normal’ by using social
media to provide warnings about scams or
other online threats.

•	Look at the best ways to improve cyber security
education at all levels so that people are better
equipped to use cyberspace safely.

•	Work with internet companies to explore

the potential for online sanctions for online
offences.

•	Work with Internet Service Providers (ISPs)

to help individuals identify whether their
computers have been compromised and what
they can do to resolve the compromise and
protect themselves from future attacks.

•	Provide clear cyber security advice for use

by anyone using the internet so that people
can decide how they want to use cyberspace,
informed of the risks.

•	Improve the information available to people

buying security products by encouraging the
development of security ‘kitemarks’. BIS will
work with domestic, European and global and
commercial standards organisations to stimulate
the development of industry-led standards
and guidance that help customers to navigate
the market and differentiate companies with
appropriate levels of protection and good cyber
security products.

4.39 Get Safe Online (see below) already exists
as a platform around which this effort will be
built. We are talking to funding partners, internet
companies, retailers and ISPs about how we
improve it and make it more interactive; develop
more sustained awareness activity; signpost the
public to further sources of support; and through
‘kitemarks’ help consumers distinguish between
genuinely helpful products and advice and the
purveyors of ‘scareware’. A joint action plan will be
launched in the New Year.
Get Safe Online is a joint public/private 

sector campaign to raise awareness of

The UK Cyber Security Strategy: Protecting and promoting the UK in a digital world

Raising business awareness
4.40 As well as working with consumers, we need
to raise awareness in business of the potential
threat to reputation, revenues and intellectual
property from cyber attack.
4.41 Business is the largest victim of crime
and economic espionage perpetrated through
cyberspace. Responsibility for the issue must be
shared by Government and the private sector.
Ultimately it is the private sector that owns the
assets and makes the business decisions about
investing in improved cyber security. We have
already begun to do more to raise awareness of
the threat and what businesses can do to protect
their assets. However, raising awareness will only
take us so far and we need to do more to bring
about behavioural change.
4.42 The joint public/private sector cyber security
‘hub’ (see page 28) has a key role to play in
helping to identify and manage threats by sharing
information.
4.43 Get Safe Online increases awareness and
provides advice for consumers and small and
medium sized companies. But we need other
measures to reach these businesses that are not
already acting – and have lots of other competing
demands on their time. We will use digital channels
and online media to raise awareness of threats to
information assets and reputation, and encourage
more cyber-aware behaviour by SMEs, including
using online tutorials.
4.44 In order to improve the protection of
business critical information and assets the
Government believes it is important to find
ways to improve the profile and transparency
of information about breaches of cyber security.
BIS will publish in 2013 comprehensive research
into cyber security breaches including research
into security breach disclosure in UK business.
In the meantime BIS will work through existing
and ongoing research in this area (the 2012
Information Security Breaches Survey produced by
PricewaterhouseCoopers and Reed Exhibitions) to
improve understanding of the risks.
4.45 The market for security products can be
hard to navigate for small businesses, just as it is for
individual consumers. So BIS will work to stimulate

the development of industry-led standards and
guidance that help customers to differentiate good
cyber security products and services. BIS is also
exploring ways in which industry-led standards
for firms’ performance on cyber security might
be used as a market differentiator more generally.
BIS will work with users, industry and appropriate
standards organisations (domestic, and European
and international) to stimulate the development of
appropriate standards.
4.46 The suppliers of business services have an
important role to play in raising awareness. As
well as mainstreaming cyber security messages in
its own outreach to business, BIS will work with
professional business services and the insurance
market on how we can together ensure that cyber
security is effectively managed as a business risk.
BIS will hold a strategic summit with professional
business services providers (including insurers,
lawyers and auditors) to discuss how they can
develop the services they offer to businesses to
help them manage and reduce the risks.
4.47 Government will work specifically with the
retail industry to address challenges there. The UK
has one of the largest online retail economies in
the world, with transactions estimated to be worth
more than £100 billion in 2009; UK shoppers
spend more on average online than in any other
major economy. In order to protect this thriving
online retail sector, the Government is establishing
a Retail Cyber Security Forum to address the
specific key issues for this sector, including effective
reporting and information sharing. Government
will work with the British Retail Consortium and its
members to help consumers stay safe online.
4.48 Through their relationship with their
customers, ISPs can make an important
contribution to identifying and preventing cyber
attacks on UK networks. Building on the existing
relationships between Government and ISPs, we
will work together to co-design a set of guiding
principles that could be adopted on a voluntary
basis. These principles might include agreement for
ISPs to offer support to internet users to deal with
malicious activity on their systems, agreement to
establish a collaborative means of identifying and
sharing threat information between Government
and ISPs, or for ISPs to offer customers the means

4. Action: Meeting threats, taking opportunities

to address compromises to their computers or to
protect themselves from cyber attacks in future.
Fostering business opportunity
4.49 In order to support the private sector in
taking the opportunities that cyberspace offers we
will aim to foster a vibrant and innovative cyber
security sector in the UK, with global reach.
4.50 GCHQ is home to world-class expertise
in cyber security. Government will explore
ways in which that expertise can more directly
benefit economic growth and support the
development of the UK cyber security sector
without compromising the agency’s core security
and intelligence mission. For example, options
examined might include:

•	Working with private sector partners to explore
the potential commercial applications for
GCHQ’s unique expertise.

•	GCHQ working with BIS, the Technology

Strategy Board and the Engineering and Physical
Sciences Research Council to explore strategic
vehicles for bringing together industry, academia
and Government to develop and exploit
innovations in cyber security.

•	A government-sponsored venture capital model
to unlock innovation on cyber security in SMEs.

4.51 As we have said, we plan to require higher
cyber security standards for ICT products supplied
into the Public Services Network. To ensure
smaller companies can play their part as drivers
of new ideas and innovation we will bring forward
proposals as part of the Growth Review to help
small and medium sized enterprises fully access
the value of public procurement. For cyber
security, Government is setting an expectation
that at least 25% of the value of Government
cyber security contracts go to SMEs, either
by breaking contracts into lots or by including
SME sub-contracting arrangements in contracts
awarded to larger suppliers (providing these
arrangements are proportionate to the market
conditions for the particular requirements of
the contract). The Cabinet Office will work with
departments to ensure the transparency of SME
arrangements in all new contracts, in line with the

Prime Minster’s commitments on transparency in
procurement and contracting.
4.52 We are also raising the standard of cyber
security we expect from suppliers of sensitive
defence equipment. We are doing this on national
security grounds: for example to prevent key data
on equipment performance being compromised
by a foreign intelligence service before the kit
even enters service. But the Government hopes
these rising standards for public procurement will
also help drive forward the wider market in cyber
security in the UK.
4.53 Better data on the extent of the problem,
a developing insurance market and clearer
signposts on what good cyber security looks
like should between them help remove factors
dampening demand within the UK. UK Trade and
Investment (UKTI) will work with the security
sector’s trade associations to make sure that this
increasing domestic strength is leveraged to help
UK firms sell abroad. We will turn the threat into
opportunity and make strong cyber security a
positive for all UK businesses and part of the UK’s
competitive advantage.
4.54 Further information on the National Cyber
Security Programme and the Government’s
approach can be found in Annex A.
