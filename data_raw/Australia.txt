PRIME MINISTER’S 
FOREWORD

Prime Minister The Hon Malcolm Turnbull MP


This Cyber Security Strategy sets out my 
Government’s philosophy and program for 
meeting the dual challenges of the digital 
age—advancing and protecting our interests 
online. 

The maintenance of our security online and 
the protection of freedom online are not only 
compatible but reinforce each other. A secure 
cyberspace provides trust and confidence for 
individuals, business and the public sector to 
share ideas, collaborate and innovate. 

The Internet is transforming how we socialise 
and do business in ways its founders could 
not have imagined. It is changing how we are 
entertained and informed, affecting almost 
every aspect of our lives. 

The need for an open, free and secure Internet 
goes far beyond economics. 

It is important for ensuring public and 
financial accountability and strengthening 
democratic institutions. It underpins freedom 
of expression and reinforces safe and vibrant 
communities. 

If we are to fully realise the social, economic 
and strategic benefits of being online, we 
must ensure the administration of the Internet 
continues to be governed by those who use 
it—not dominated by governments. 

Equally, cyberspace cannot be allowed to 
become a lawless domain. Both Government 
and the private sector have vital roles to play. 
While governments can take the lead in 
facilitating innovation and providing security, 
businesses need to ensure their cyber security 
practices are robust and up to date. 

Australia and Australians are targets for 
malicious actors—including serious and 
organised criminal syndicates and foreign 
adversaries—who are all using cyberspace to 
further their aims and attack our interests. 
The scale and reach of malicious cyber 
activity affecting Australian public and 
private sector organisations and individuals 
is unprecedented. The rate of compromise 
is increasing and the methods used by 
malicious actors are rapidly evolving.

The Australian Government has a duty to 
protect our nation from cyber attack and 
to ensure that we can defend our interests 
in cyberspace. We must safeguard against 
criminality, espionage, sabotage and unfair 
competition online. 

Australia and its allies will work together 
internationally to promote norms of behaviour 
that are consistent with a free, open and 
secure Internet. These norms include that 
states should not knowingly conduct or 
support cyber-enabled intellectual property 
theft for commercial advantage. We need to 
do this while redoubling our efforts to counter 



the spread of propaganda online which incites 
extremist and terrorist violence. 

As the Snowden disclosures demonstrate, 
often the most damaging risk to government 
or business online security is not ‘malware’ 
but ‘warmware’; the ability of a trusted insider 
to cause massive disruption to a network or 
to use legitimate access to obtain classified 
material and then illegally disclose it. 

Technical solutions are important but cultural 
change will be most effective in mitigating 
this form of cyber attack. 

As businesses and governments we must 
better educate and empower our employees 
to use sound practices online. This Strategy 
seeks to promote an improved institutional 
cyber culture and raise awareness of cyber 
practice across government and business to 
enable all Australians to be secure online. 

The Strategy complements the key elements 
of my Government’s Economic Plan—helping 
the transition to a new and more diverse 
economy which is fuelled by innovation, the 
opening of new markets and more investment 
in Australian enterprise. The cyber security 
industry is in its relative infancy but undergoing 
rapid growth. Australia is well placed to 
be a leader in cyber security. We can use 
technology as a means to manage the threats 
and risks that come with being online and 
interconnected—and to grow our true potential.

With the Innovation and Science Agenda 
and the Defence Industry Plan, this Strategy 
will help bring more Australian technologies 
to market, prepare our children for the 
jobs of the future by boosting science, 
technology, engineering and mathematics 
(STEM) participation and support and create 
innovative Australian companies. 

Most importantly, this Strategy will play a key 
role in securing Australia in the 21st Century. 
It also represents a significant investment in 
cyber security. The Government will invest 
more than $230 million over four years to 
enhance Australia’s cyber security capability 
and deliver new initiatives. This complements 
the significant investment in cyber security 
outlined in the 2016 Defence White Paper, 
boosting Defence cyber capabilities by up to 
$400 million over the next decade.

The Government will show leadership locally, 
regionally and globally. I will designate a 
Minister Assisting the Prime Minister on 
cyber security and appoint a Special Adviser 
on Cyber Security in my Department, the 
Government’s lead on cyber security policy. 
The Minister for Foreign Affairs will also 
appoint Australia’s first Cyber Ambassador 
and the Department of Defence will continue 
to lead the co-location of the Government’s 
operational cyber security capabilities in the 
Australian Cyber Security Centre.

This new structure will ensure cyber security 
is given the attention it demands in an 
age where cyber opportunities and threats 
must be considered together and must be 
addressed proactively, not simply as a reaction 
to the inevitability of future cyber events. This 
Strategy will develop partnerships between the 
Australian public and private sectors, support 
home-grown cyber security capabilities and 
promote international cyber cooperation. We 
will change and adapt when needed to stay 
competitive and influential in the constantly 
changing technology landscape.

I look forward to working with governments 
both at home and abroad, the private sector 
and the community to strengthen trust online 
and together better realise Australia’s digital 
potential.

EXECUTIVE 
SUMMARY

Strong cyber security is a fundamental element of our growth and 
prosperity in a global economy. It is also vital for our national security. 
It requires partnership involving governments, the private sector and 
the community.

Being connected is now essential, creating 
new opportunities for innovation and 
growth for all Australians. To be competitive, 
businesses need to be online. But this also 
brings risks. Australia is increasingly a target 
for cybercrime and espionage. All of us—
governments, businesses and individuals—
need to work together to build resilience to 
cyber security threats and to make the most of 
opportunities online. 

To grow, Australia needs to innovate and 
further diversify its economy—to access new 
markets and new forms of wealth creation. We 
must embrace disruptive technologies; those 
that have the potential to fundamentally 
change traditional business models and the 
way people live and work. They will open up 
new possibilities for agile businesses in ways 
as yet unimagined. 

But the potential of digital technologies 
depends on the extent to which we can trust 
the Internet and cyberspace. Getting cyber 
security right will mean we capture more of 
the opportunities the connected world offers. 
It will also make Australia a preferred place to 
do business. This in turn will boost our national 
prosperity. We can also expand our cyber 
security businesses and export capability.

Australia’s cyber security is built on a solid 
foundation. Our past investment has been 
strong. Recent Government initiatives such 
as the Australian Cyber Security Centre have 
lifted Government capabilities to a new level. 
Many of our larger businesses, particularly 
banks and telecommunications companies, 
have strong cyber security capabilities. Our 
future work will build on this platform.

We must also do more. If an organisation is 
connected to the Internet, it is vulnerable 
to compromise. As people and systems 
become ever more interconnected, the 
quantity and value of information held 
online has increased. So have efforts to steal 
and exploit that information, harming our 
economy, privacy and safety. Cyberspace, and 
the dynamic opportunities it offers, is under 
persistent threat.

Malicious cyber activity is a security challenge 
for all Australians. Australian organisations 
across the public and private sectors have 
been compromised by state-sponsored or 
non-state actors. Overseas, large multinational 
companies and government organisations 
have been targeted, losing substantial 
amounts of sensitive commercial and personal 
information or incurring major damage to 
their business and reputation.

To grow our cyber security capabilities to 
anticipate and respond to cyber threats, we 
must address our shortage of cyber security 
professionals. It is critical that we build our 
nation’s stock of cyber security skills, which are 
becoming increasingly essential for life and 
work in our connected world.

Ultimately, to deal with all these challenges 
we must elevate cyber security as an issue 
of national importance. Leadership will be 
critical to achieving this goal. 



The Australian Government will take a 
lead role and in partnership with others, 
promote action to protect our online 
security. Much of our digital infrastructure 
is owned by the private sector, so securing 
Australia’s cyberspace must also be a shared 
responsibility. It will be important that 
businesses and the research community work 
with governments and other stakeholders 
to improve our cyber defences and create 
solutions to shared problems.

A STRATEGY TO SECURE 
OUR PROSPERITY IN A 
CONNECTED WORLD

The Government is committed to enabling 
innovation, growth and prosperity for all 
Australians through strong cyber security. This 
is in line with the Australian Government’s 
broader National Innovation and Science 
Agenda to help to create a modern, dynamic, 
21st Century economy for Australia.

This Strategy establishes five themes of action 
for Australia’s cyber security over the next four 
years to 2020:

1. A national cyber partnership
2. Strong cyber defences
3. Global responsibility and influence
4. Growth and innovation
5. A cyber smart nation


Each theme is supported by actions the 
Government will take to improve our cyber 
security and ensure Australia can continue 
to grow and prosper today and to seize 
opportunities for tomorrow. Recognising 
that cyberspace is dynamic, the Strategy’s 
initiatives will be reviewed and updated 
annually and the Strategy reviewed and 
updated every four years. 

Some actions are already underway and will 
be ongoing. Others are new and will be co-
designed with stakeholders from the private 
sector, research community and international 
partners. Many of these actions also rely on 
working with all Australians—because we all 
have a part to play in enhancing our security 
and confidence in Australia as a modern 
economy and trusted place to do business.

The ideas that underpin this Strategy were 
drawn from a classified Cyber Security Review 
led by the Department of the Prime Minister 
and Cabinet. The Department, through the 
new position of a Special Adviser on Cyber 
Security, will lead implementation of this 
Strategy for the Government, in its central 
responsibility for cyber security policy.

Ultimately, all of us—governments, businesses, 
communities and individuals—need to tackle 
cyber security threats to make the most of 
online opportunities. This Strategy charts 
a new way forward for Australia’s cyber 
future, one that is creative, collaborative 
and adaptable.



National cyber partnership icon
A NATIONAL CYBER PARTNERSHIP

Together, the Australian Government and business leaders will jointly 
drive Australia’s cyber security, setting the strategic agenda through 
annual Cyber Security meetings. Hosted by the Prime Minister and 
comprising leaders from business and the research community, 
the meetings will align the key initiatives in this Strategy and tackle 
emerging cyber security issues. A Minister Assisting the Prime 
Minister on cyber security will also underpin this effort.

We will streamline the cyber security governance for 
Commonwealth Government agencies and clearly identify lead 
responsibilities. Further, the Australian Cyber Security Centre will be 
relocated to a facility that allows the centre to grow and enables the 
Government and the private sector to work more effectively together.

We will also sponsor research to better understand the costs of 
malicious cyber activity to the Australian economy to ensure 
organisations have local information to inform their investment and 
risk management decisions for cyber security.Strong cyber defences icon


STRONG CYBER DEFENCES

Australia’s networks and systems will be increasingly resilient to 
attack and hard to compromise. We will better detect, deter and 
respond to cyber security threats and better anticipate risks. 

Australian governments and the private sector will work together 
to share more information, including from classified sources, 
exchanging information on threats and responses through joint 
cyber threat sharing centres in key capital cities and an online cyber 
threat sharing portal. 

We will jointly exercise our response to be better prepared for cyber 
attacks. The Government will invest in agencies in the Australian 
Cyber Security Centre. We will increase the capacity of the national 
Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) Australia to work with 
Australian businesses, in particular those providing national critical 
services. We will also improve the Australian Signals Directorate’s 
ability to detect cyber security vulnerabilities. This will complement 
the investment in cyber capabilities being made through the 2016 
Defence White Paper.



The Government will improve its capacity to tackle cybercrime by 
increasing the number of specialists conducting threat detection and 
awareness, technical analysis and forensic assessments of cybercrime 
in the Australian Crime Commission and the Australian Federal 
Police.

Australia will raise the bar on cyber security performance. 
Organisations in both the public and private sectors need to better 
understand cyber risks and have stronger cyber defences. Cyber 
security is too often viewed as simply an IT issue—it belongs at the 
centre of business strategy, for organisations across the public 
and private sectors. Governments, businesses and the research 
community will co-design national voluntary cyber security 
guidelines to promote good practice that all organisations can 
use. These will be based on world class strategies developed by 
the Australian Signals Directorate and aligned with international 
standards where possible. Voluntary cyber security governance 
‘health checks’ will also help organisations understand their cyber 
security strengths and gaps.Global responsibility and influence icon


GLOBAL RESPONSIBILITY AND INFLUENCE

Australia will work with its international partners to champion an 
open, free and secure Internet. We will work together to address 
cyber security threats and highlight the opportunities a free Internet 
presents for the global economy. This work will be enhanced 
through the appointment of a Cyber Ambassador who will identify 
opportunities for practical international cooperation and ensure 
Australia has a coordinated, consistent and influential voice on 
international cyber issues.

Australia supports a cyberspace in which states abide by 
international law and their behaviour is supported and reinforced by 
agreed norms—or standards for appropriate conduct—and practical 
confidence building measures that reduce the risk of conflict. 

Most cybercrime targeting Australians originates overseas, so the 
Government will partner with international law enforcement, 
intelligence agencies and other computer emergency response 
teams. This will build cyber capacity to prevent and shut down safe 
havens for cyber criminals. Australia’s capacity building assistance 
will also enable our international partners, particularly in the Indo-
Pacific region, to develop their institutional capacity to tackle cyber 
security threats. 



Growth and innovation icon
GROWTH AND INNOVATION

Cyberspace presents enormous opportunities for all Australian 
organisations. The Internet is an essential tool for businesses of all 
sizes. As a platform, it delivers existing services and products, as 
well as enabling the development of innovative technologies and 
new commercial opportunities. Equally, it underpins transformative 
change in the public, research and non-profit sectors.

In the Asia-Pacific region, disruptive business models and the 
technologies that enable them—such as big data analytics, mobile 
Internet, the Internet of Things and cloud computing—could 
create up to US$625 billion in economic activity per year by 2030, 
representing 12 per cent of the region’s total projected GDP. 

The Government’s commitment to cyber security will help 
businesses to diversify and develop new markets, laying the 
foundations for a prosperous future. To take advantage of the 
growing global market for cyber security services, the Government 
will also support Australia’s cyber security sector to expand and 
promote their capabilities to the global market. Domestically, 
strong cyber security services will encourage trust and confidence in 
Australian businesses operating online. 

With better focused cyber security research and development 
that responds to the needs of industry and governments, Australia 
will generate investment and jobs and enhance our national cyber 
security. It will also make Australia a more attractive destination for 
business investment. 

Australia will position itself as a location for cyber security 
innovation by establishing a Cyber Security Growth Centre, 
through the National Innovation and Science Agenda. Creating a 
national network of research and innovation, the Growth Centre 
will bring together Australian governments, businesses, start-ups 
and the research community to define and prioritise cyber security 
challenges that are both critical to national success and those for 
which Australia has a leading ability to build globally competitive 
solutions. The Growth Centre will also link to existing cyber security 
innovation hubs overseas. The Growth Centre and its network will 
help strengthen our cyber defences as well as growing business 
opportunities and creating jobs. This includes through its connection 
with other initiatives in this Strategy such as the joint cyber threat 
sharing centres.

Also through the National Innovation and Science Agenda, the 
Government is boosting the capacity of Data61—the Commonwealth 
Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation’s (CSIRO) digital 
powerhouse—to propel cyber security innovation, with a particular 
focus on support for cyber security start-ups and technical capability 



development internally and through Data61’s partnerships with 
universities. This will include a cyber specific PhD scholarship 
program, with recipients spending time with Data61. 

These initiatives complement other initiatives in the Government’s 
National Innovation and Science Agenda which will also support 
cyber security businesses to grow and prosper. Similarly, all Australian 
innovations will benefit from improved protection from cyber-
enabled intellectual property theft.Cyber smart nation icon


A CYBER SMART NATION

Underpinning the success of the other four themes in this Strategy is 
Australia’s commitment to addressing the critical shortage of skilled 
cyber security professionals. Building on the Government’s existing 
science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) related 
initiatives, we will tackle this major problem through all levels of the 
education system, starting with the most urgent need in the tertiary 
sector. 

The Government, together with the academic and research 
community and businesses, will co-design a model and then 
establish academic centres of cyber security excellence in universities 
to ensure graduates have the right skills and expertise. The centres of 
excellence will link with others around the world and also link with 
other initiatives in this Strategy such as the joint cyber threat sharing 
centres and the Cyber Security Growth Centre.

Australian governments, businesses and the research community will 
also work together to fix the cyber security skills pipeline to ensure 
more children at school study relevant subjects and to enable people 
at all stages of their careers to develop cyber security skills.

The Government will also further improve national cyber security 
awareness and work to ensure all Australians understand the risks 
and benefits of the Internet and how to protect themselves online, 
through sustained joint public-private awareness initiatives and 
education campaigns.

cyber phenomenon. That 
potential revolves not just 
around Australia’s national 
security, but equally around 
its economic wellbeing: it is 
unlocked by tackling these 
issues square on; by getting to 
grips with them in partnership 
across government, industry,

THE CYBER 
LANDSCAPE



CYBERSPACE IS A WORLD OF OPPORTUNITY...

The Internet based economy is growing twice 
as fast as the rest of the global economy. This 
is driven by a combination of surging business 
innovation and increased connectivity. 
Eight in ten Australians access the Internet 
daily. If poor cyber security erodes trust and 
confidence in cyberspace, the economic 
opportunity of a connected Australian 
economy will suffer. On the other hand, 
Australia stands to prosper significantly with 
reliable cyber security.

Australians have quickly embraced economic 
opportunities in cyberspace. In 2014 alone, 
the Internet based economy contributed $79 
billion to the Australian economy (or 5.1 per 
cent of GDP). 

This amount could grow to $139 billion 
annually (7.3 per cent of GDP) by 2020 as more 
devices, services and people are connected 
online. 

Businesses and governments are also 
benefiting from improved online and mobile 
technology. They are using information 
gathered online to tailor products and services 
to individual needs. The rate of development 
of new commercial opportunities will 
accelerate as more and more of the things 
we own and use, such as fridges, cars, even 
pacemakers, are connected to the Internet 
and to each other. Once referred to as the 
‘Internet of Things’, this phenomenum is now 
the ‘Internet of Everything’.

… BUT CYBER SECURITY THREATS ARE SERIOUS AND 
GROWING

As people and systems become increasingly 
interconnected, the quantity and value of 
information held online has increased. So have 
efforts to steal and exploit that information. 
Cyberspace, and the dynamic opportunities it 
offers, is under persistent threat.

Malicious cyber activity is a security challenge 
for all Australians. Australian organisations 
across the public and private sectors have 
been compromised by state-sponsored or 
non-state actors. Overseas, large multinational 
companies and government organisations 
have been targeted, losing substantial 
amounts of sensitive commercial and personal 
information or incurring major damage to 
their business and reputation.

Figures vary, but cybercrime is estimated 
to cost Australians over $1 billion each year. 
Worldwide, losses from cyber security attacks 
are estimated to cost economies around 
one per cent of GDP per year. On this basis, 
the real impact of cybercrime to Australia 
could be around $17 billion annually. These 
costs are expected to rise. Government, 
telecommunications, resources, energy, 
defence, banking and finance sectors are likely 
to remain key targets for cyber criminals and 
malicious state actors alike.

The Australian Cyber Security Centre 
Threat Report 2015 says the cyber threat is 
undeniable, unrelenting and continues to 
grow. If an organisation is connected to the 
Internet, it is vulnerable to compromise—and 
the malicious cyber activities in the public eye 
are just the tip of the iceberg.

TYPES OF MALICIOUS CYBER ACTIVITY

Malicious cyber activities are wide ranging. They include activities designed to compromise 
the confidentiality, integrity or availability of computer networks or ICT systems or 
the information on them. The term ‘cyber espionage’ refers to theft of information for 
intelligence purposes. ‘Cybercrime’ refers to crimes directed at computers, such as 
illegally modifying electronic data or seeking a ransom to unlock a computer affected by 
malicious software. It also includes crimes where computers are part of an offence, such as 
online fraud.

In this Strategy, the term ‘cyber attack’ refers to deliberate acts that seriously compromise 
national security, stability or prosperity by manipulating, denying access to, degrading 
or destroying computers or networks or the information resident on them. Other serious 
compromises are simply referred to as ‘malicious cyber activity’.



Cyber adversaries are aggressive and 
persistent in their efforts to compromise 
Australian networks and information. They are 
constantly improving their tradecraft in an 
attempt to defeat our network defences and 
exploit new technologies. 

They will also target the weakest link; if the 
network security of their primary target 
is robust, they will move to more easily 
compromised connected networks that could 
provide access to the primary target.

Further, the differences between some 
malicious cyber actors—such as organised 
criminal networks, state-sponsored actors and 
issue motivated groups—are becoming less 
distinct. For example, activity by some cyber 
criminals can be more sophisticated than 
those conducted by many nation states. This 
growing network of malicious actors is having 
a global impact.

Drivers of the rising cost of malicious cyber activity in Australia

Greater number of cyber security incidents

Almost one million Australians were estimated to be victims of identity theft online 
in 2014. Over 9,500 cyber crimes were reported to the Australian Cybercrime Online 
Reporting Network in its first three months of operation. The Australian Signals 
Directorate responded to 37% more government cyber security incidents in 2014 
compared to previous years.

Greater number of targets

The range of possible targets is expanding from computers and phones to other 
devices connected to the Internet of Things, such as cars, fridges and medical 
equipment. There will be at least 50 billion connected devices by 2020.

Greater sophistication

Cyber attacks are becoming more sophisticated and previously unseen malicious 
activity, including infections to the firmware of hard dirves, can now leave almost 
no trace. This saw software developers taking an average of 59 days to roll out 
patches for software vulnerabilities in 2014, compared to just four days in 2013.



INTRUSION VECTORS

An intrusion vector is the path or means an actor uses to gain access to a target. Common 
intrusion vectors include emails sent with malicious links and attachments; fake or 
manipulated websites that download viruses; removable media such as USB drives; 
unsecured wireless hotspots; and access through weak passwords. 

Malicious actors can also use intrusion vectors to exploit human behaviour. Crafting an 
email containing malicious software based on a person’s interests to entice them to 
open it is a vector, know as ‘spearphishing’. These types of vectors are often referred to as 
social engineering: manipulating a person, overtly or otherwise, into performing actions 
or divulging confidential information. It can be in person or through cyberspace, such as 
grooming targets on social media.

WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE

Australia has an opportunity to be a leader 
in the global cyber solution. As a stable and 
creative nation, Australia will help ensure 
the Internet is open, free and secure. In 
partnership with other countries, we can 
strengthen the foundations of international 
stability in cyberspace, enhance cooperative 
partnerships and build cyber security capacity. 

Modelling in the US suggests the costs of 
managing cyber security risks for businesses 
are set to increase by 38 per cent over the next 
ten years, as further investment is required 
for cyber training and security tools. It is 
estimated that spending on cyber security of 
critical infrastructure in the Asia-Pacific region 
will reach US$22 billion by 2020, presenting 
a growing opportunity for Australia’s cyber 
security industry.

This will deliver domestic dividends. 
Businesses are looking to invest in places with 
skilled workforces, engaged online consumers 
and simple regulatory environments that 
support innovation and security. Confidence in 
doing business online is critical. Getting cyber 
security right will mean Australia becomes 
a location of innovation and investment, a 
place where businesses start and grow, where 
organisations diversify and export and where 
all individuals can protect themselves online.



CYBER SECURITY ENABLES DISRUPTIVE TECHNOLOGY

In combination, many ‘disruptive’ technologies 
have significant potential to drive economic 
growth. In Southeast Asia alone, McKinsey 
has estimated that between mobile Internet, 
big data, the Internet of Things, automation 
of knowledge work and cloud technology, 
there is the potential to unleash some US$220 
billion to US$625 billion in annual economic 
impact by 2030. But to fully realise these and 
other opportunities, these technologies and 
the infrastructure on which they operate 
must be trusted. Strong cyber security will 
enable this.

INTERNET OF EVERYTHING 

It is estimated that by 2020 there will be at least 50 billion devices connected to the 
Internet globally. This explosion of connectivity will accelerate innovation in products and 
services, providing new business opportunities and new jobs.

However, the more connected ‘things’ are, the more targets there are for malicious actors. 
Part of the problem is that online security has not been considered in the design of many 
of the devices connected to the Internet. This has made it easier for malicious actors to 
disrupt and damage networks.

As an example of how vulnerable Internet connected devices can be, in 2015 the popular 
technology website reported that security researchers had hacked into the 
electronics of a US car through its online entertainment system, changing its speed and 
braking capability before shutting the car engine down remotely. This demonstration led 
to the manufacturer having to provide software updates for 1.4 million US cars and trucks 
Wired.comfitted with the same entertainment system. 

Increased connectivity is also changing the relationship between consumers and 
businesses; it is fragmenting supply chains and business models. In turn, this will affect 
how people live and work, and how industries and economies perform. 



CLOUD COMPUTING 

Cloud Computing is a key feature of Australia’s increasingly networked society. It provides 
individuals and businesses with greater data storage capacity, cost savings, convenience 
and flexibility. However, there are risks associated with cloud computing, including loss of 
control of data and problems recovering data.

The Government launched its Cloud Computing Policy in 2014, requiring Government 
agencies to adopt a ‘cloud first’ approach—where it is fit for purpose, provides adequate 
protection of data and delivers value for money. With the right measures, cloud computing 
can be used in both the public and private sector to improve cyber security, particularly for 
small organisations and businesses. 

The Australian Cyber Security Centre has also provided guidance on secure cloud 
computing, including a list of Certified Cloud Services.



“Cyber security cannot be left to the 
Government alone to solve. Organisations 
and individuals play an essential role in 
effectively reducing cyber security risk.”

National cyber partnership icon
A NATIONAL 
CYBER 
PARTNERSHIP

GOVERNMENTS, BUSINESSES 
AND THE RESEARCH COMMUNITY 
TOGETHER ADVANCE 
AUSTRALIA’S CYBER SECURITY

To achieve our goal, the Government will:

• host annual cyber security leaders’ meetings, where the Prime Minister 
and business leaders set the strategic cyber security agenda and drive this 
Strategy’s implementation.
• streamline its cyber security governance and structures to improve 
interaction between the private and public sectors and will relocate the 
Australian Cyber Security Centre to allow for its growth and to enable the 
Government and the private sector to work more effectively together.
• work with the private sector and academic community to better understand 
the cost of malicious cyber activity to the Australian economy. 




National co-leadership and cross-sectoral 
partnerships are essential for strong 
cyber security.

Cyber security needs to be driven from 
the top. Economic and national security 
imperatives mean that cyber security is a 
strategic issue for leaders—ministers, senior 
executives and boards—not just for IT and 
security staff. More strategic discussions 
between public and private sector leaders 
will focus on practical outcomes and elevate 
cyber security, both as a business risk and as 
a strategic opportunity rather than just as an 
operational matter.

Government and business leaders can do 
more to raise cyber security’s prominence 
within their organisations, teams and peer 
groups. Including cyber security as a priority 
for corporate boards and international leaders 
will demonstrate that cyber security is a 
strategic priority for Australia.

ACTIONS SO FAR:

• The national Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) Australia partners 
with over 500 businesses and advises on cyber security threats to the owners 
and operators of Australia’s critical infrastructure. CERT Australia also works 
directly with other computer emergency response teams around the world. 
As part of their partnership arrangements, CERT Australia regularly convenes 
National and Regional Information Exchanges with businesses. 
• The Cyber Security Challenge Australia is an annual cyber security competition 
for Australian tertiary students run by an alliance comprising Australian 
Government, business, academic and research professionals who are committed 
to supporting the next generation of Australian cyber security talent. The 
competition runs over 24 hours and tests the technical and communications 
skills of participants while promoting cyber security careers. 
• Australian businesses and our research community are partnering to improve 
cyber security information sharing and innovation. Boards are increasingly 
considering cyber security issues. Some businesses share their data on malicious 
software with the Government while others are investing in research and 
development in cyber security technologies.




We are all responsible for our own activities in 
cyberspace, including being aware of the risks 
and how to protect ourselves and those who 
we are connected to. 

More senior leaders of Australian organisations 
need to better understand cyber risk. 
Strengthened cyber security partnerships 
across the public and private sectors will give 
us a competitive advantage and increase 
Australia’s potential as a modern, connected 
and innovative economy.

Under this Strategy, Government and business 
leaders will co-design national cyber security 
initiatives, including the Prime Minister 
holding annual cyber security meetings 
with business leaders. The meetings will 
bring together leaders from many sectors 
of the Australian economy to discuss how 
Government and business can collaborate 
to strengthen our economy and national 
security by building greater resilience to 
cyber security threats.

It is vital the public and private sectors work 
together to ensure individual and collective 
security, across the spectrum of cyber 
security challenges and opportunities that 
Australia faces.

CLEAR ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES

Organisations need easy and consistent 
interfaces with Government agencies on cyber 
security. A new streamlined Government 
cyber security structure will bring together 
disparate elements of both the policy and 
operational areas. 

The Prime Minister will be supported by a 
Minister Assisting the Prime Minister for cyber 
security to lead the Government’s work with 
business leaders to implement the initiatives.

In addition to the appointment of a Minister 
Assisting the Prime Minister on cyber security, 
the nation’s cyber security governance will 
have three coordinated, strategic-level pillars.

First, the Department of the Prime Minister 
and Cabinet will strengthen its current lead 
role on cyber security policy and be the central 
point for policy issues to ensure a simplified 
Government policy interface for stakeholders. 
The Department will provide integrated 
oversight of the Government’s cyber security 
policy and implementation of this Strategy. It 
will also prioritise the Government’s activities 
against the Strategy’s national cyber security 
objectives.

Leadership and advocacy of this work will be 
driven by a new position in the Department, 
the Prime Minister’s Special Adviser on 
Cyber Security. The Special Adviser will lead 
the development of cyber security strategy 
and policy, provide clear objectives and 
priorities to operational agencies and oversee 
agencies’ implementation of those priorities. 
The Special Adviser will also ensure the 
Government is partnering effectively with 
Australian governments, the private sector, 
non governmental organisations, the research 
community and international partners.

Second, the Australian Cyber Security Centre 
(ACSC), better guided by whole-of-nation 
cyber security priorities, will continue to 
bring together the Government’s operational 
cyber security capabilities and build on its 
world renowned cyber expertise to support 
a broader range of organisations at the 
operational level. In addition, ACSC outreach 
will be further improved and streamlined to 
make it easier for the private sector to interact. 
Recognising that Defence, in particular the 
Australian Signals Directorate, does much of 
the heavy lifting for the Government’s role in 
defending Australia against malicious cyber 
activity, it will continue to lead the ACSC. 



The ACSC will move to a new location. This 
will enable a more integrated partnership 
between the Government and its operational 
stakeholders, including businesses, the 
research and academic community and 
foreign partners collaborating with the ACSC. 

Relocation may improve the ability of 
relevant ACSC agencies to quickly recruit 
new people and offer more flexible 
arrangements to continue to attract 
and retain a highly skilled workforce. It 
will enable the ACSC to accommodate 
new staff recruited as a result of the 
Strategy’s implementation.

Third, the Minister for Foreign Affairs will 
appoint a Cyber Ambassador to lead 
Australia’s international cyber effort. The 
Ambassador, working closely with and 
guided by the work of the Special Adviser 
on Cyber Security, will advocate for an open, 
free and secure Internet based on our values 
of free speech, privacy and the rule of law. 
This role will include ensuring Australia has 
a coordinated approach to cyber capacity 
building in our region, continuing to advocate 
against state censorship of the Internet and 
promoting our view that the opportunities 
provided by the Internet should be available 
to all people.

BETTER UNDERSTANDING COSTS AND BENEFITS

Statistical data on the national impact of 
cyber security compromises will enable 
Australian businesses and governments to 
make informed decisions when managing 
cyber risks. Data collection measures will help 
Australian governments and the private sector 
alike to make evidence based investment 
decisions that address the reality of cyber 
security threats to Australia’s economy 
and security.

To help organisations better understand 
the impacts of malicious cyber activities, 
the Government will also sponsor research 
to better understand the cost of malicious 
cyber activity to the Australian economy.



“Fighting cyber threats needs 
shared action so decision-
makers in governments, 
businesses and the 
community broadly have

Strong cyber defences icon
STRONG 
CYBER 
DEFENCES

AUSTRALIA’S NETWORKS 
AND SYSTEMS ARE HARD TO 
COMPROMISE AND RESILIENT TO 
CYBER ATTACK

To achieve our goal, the Government will:

• establish a layered approach for sharing real time public–private cyber threat 
information through joint cyber threat sharing centres, initially piloted in a 
capital city, and an online cyber threat sharing portal.
• co-design national voluntary Cyber Security Guidelines with the private 
sector to specify good practice.
• update the Strategies to Mitigate Targeted Cyber Intrusions, published by 
the Australian Signals Directorate.


continued...



• introduce national voluntary Cyber Security 
Governance ‘health checks’ to enable 
boards and senior management to better 
understand their cyber security status.
• support small businesses to have their 
cyber security tested.
• boost the capacity of the Australian Cyber 
Security Centre to respond to cyber security 
threats and cybercrime. 
• update and align our cyber incident 
management arrangements with 
international partners and jointly exercise 
responses to malicious cyber activity with 
the private sector.
• support Government agencies to improve 
their cyber security, including guidance for 
Government agencies to manage supply 
chain security risks for ICT equipment and 
services.


Connected systems are complex and only as 
secure as the weakest link. This means that all 
Australians must work together to make sure 
our systems and information are among the 
hardest to compromise and that we have the 
best possible defences.

To better detect, deter and respond to 
malicious cyber activities, cyber threat 
information should be shared in real time 
between and within Australia’s public and 
private sectors. Both have unique information 
to contribute to the threat picture. It is only 
by combining our knowledge that we can 
comprehensively understand cyber security 
threats to Australia and how to counter them.

It is equally important to deter malicious 
cyber activities by better understanding the 
threat and bringing the perpetrators to justice. 
Due to the global nature of malicious online 
activities, tackling cybercrime will involve both 
increasing the numbers and improving the 
criminal intelligence capacity and skillsets of 
law enforcement officers at home, as well as 
partnering with law enforcement and other 
agencies abroad.

Australia’s defensive and offensive cyber 
capabilities enable us to deter and respond to 
the threat of cyber attack. Any measure used 
by Australia in deterring and responding to 
malicious cyber activities would be consistent 
with our support for the international rules-
based order and our obligations under 
international law.



ACTIONS SO FAR:

• The Australian Cyber Security Centre, opened in 2014, brings together cyber 
security capabilities across the Australian Government to collaborate and share 
threat information. 
• Under the National Plan to Combat Cybercrime, Australian governments 
committed to taking concrete steps to tackle cybercrime in six priority areas, 
including community education.
• The Australian Cybercrime Online Reporting Network (ACORN) provides advice 
on how to recognise and avoid cybercrime. ACORN allows individuals to report 
cybercrimes that breach Australian law. 
• The Australian Signals Directorate maintains world-leading cyber security 
advice in its Strategies to Mitigate Targeted Cyber Intrusions. The strategies are 
based on the Directorate’s analysis of reported security incidents and identified 
vulnerabilities.
• The Australian Media and Communications Authority facilitates the Australian 
Internet Security Initiative, a voluntary public-private partnership helping to 
reduce malicious software and service vulnerabilities occurring on Australian 
Internet protocol (IP) address ranges. 
• Recognising the particular importance of secure telecommunications networks, 
the Government is working with telecommunications companies to manage 
supply chain risks by providing advice on protecting their networks and the 
information stored and carried across them. This includes work the Government 
is doing on Telecommunications Sector Security Reform to establish more 
formal and comprehensive arrangements to better manage national security 
risks of espionage, sabotage and interference




DETECT, DETER AND RESPOND

Cyber adversaries are aggressive and 
persistent in their efforts to compromise 
Australian networks and information. They 
are constantly improving their methods in an 
attempt to defeat our network defences and 
exploit new technologies. Cyber adversaries 
will target the weakest link if the network 
security of their primary target is robust.

Strong cyber security ensures organisations 
can better detect malicious cyber activity. 
It can also be an effective deterrent by 
increasing the effort necessary for an 
attacker to succeed. Further, it can ensure 
that when malicious activity does occur, the 
consequences are reduced and the extent of 
the activity contained effectively.

Businesses own and operate most of the 
infrastructure in cyberspace. They have 
information about malicious cyber activities 
on their networks and systems that is not 
readily available to Government agencies. On 
the other hand, the Government has access to 
intelligence and other restricted information 
about cyber security threats that is not readily 
available to businesses. Equally, businesses 
want to share information with each other 
using the Government as the honest broker.

Organisations, public and private, must work 
together to build a collective understanding 
of cyber threats and risks through a layered 
approach to cyber threat sharing. By securely 
sharing sensitive information and working 
together—in real time where possible—we can 
build a stronger collective understanding and 
ability to analyse and predict cyber security 
threats. This includes detection of patterns of 
malicious cyber activity and implementing 
adaptive and behavioural analysis to enable 
an epidemiological approach to responding 
to cyber threats. Pooling our resources is also 
more efficient and will help develop quicker 
responses to compromises and build national 
resilience. We can draw from the positive 
lessons learned from other successful cyber 
security partnerships, such as AusCERT.

AUSCERT

AusCERT has helped its members prevent, detect and respond to cyber attacks since 
1993. As a membership based, independent, self-funded, not-for-profit security team 
based at The University of Queensland, AusCERT has a national focus across industry 
and government and a national and global reach. AusCERT maintains a large network 
of trusted contacts with computer emergency response teams in Australia and overseas, 
including CERT Australia, Australia’s national CERT. AusCERT contributes to initiatives to 
help improve cyber security through its services to members, assistance to international 
CERTs, partnerships, submissions to government and participation in Australian and 
international cyber security forums. 



The Australian Cyber Security Centre already 
shares threat information with the private 
sector and is improving its links to critical 
infrastructure providers. To share sensitive 
information quickly with a broader range of 
businesses, the Government will establish 
joint cyber threat sharing centres, co-designed 
with the private sector, in key capital cities 
to co-locate businesses and the research 
community together with state, territory and 
commonwealth agencies.

The joint cyber threat sharing centres will 
produce advice that organisations can use 
to take practical steps to improve their cyber 
security. The first step will be piloting the 
operating model for centres. Business and 
government partners will co-design principles 
on how information is shared. Based on the 
outcomes of the pilot, further centres will be 
opened in key capital cities.

THE AUSTRALIAN CYBER SECURITY CENTRE (ACSC)

The ACSC, opened in 2014, is a world-leading collaborative initiative. The ACSC brings 
together the Australian Government’s operational cyber security capabilities in one location 
to share threat information and combat sophisticated cyber security threats. The ACSC’s 
partner agencies include:

• Australian Crime Commission
• Australian Federal Police
• Australian Security Intelligence Organisation
• Australian Signals Directorate
• Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) Australia
• Defence Intelligence Organisation


In July 2015, the ACSC released its first public Cyber Security Threat Report outlining the 
range of cyber adversaries targeting Australian networks, their motivations, the nature of 
the attacks and their impact. This was an important first step in sharing more information 
on cyber security threats. These reports will be updated and published at least annually 
as part of the approach to cyber threat sharing. The ACSC also provides advice on how 
organisations can defend themselves online and undertakes customer surveys to assess the 
maturity of cyber security practices.



To meet the needs of an even broader set 
of businesses and organisations, including 
small to medium businesses, the Government 
will also co-design with the private sector 
an online cyber threat sharing portal. It will 
enable participants in joint cyber threat 
sharing centres to quickly publish threat 
information and practical advice that 
Australian organisations can use to strengthen 
their cyber defences. Members of the portal 
will be able to collaborate online and share 
threat information and response options.

As part of the co-design of the cyber threat 
sharing model, linkages to global cyber 
security threat sharing initiatives and 
incentives for businesses to share information 
and improve cyber security will also be 
explored. This includes examining legislative 
impediments to sharing.

The Government is committed to equipping 
the Australian Cyber Security Centre with the 
resources and tools it needs to fight the rising 
tide of malicious cyber activity and keep our 
cyberspace safe. The Government will boost 
the capacity of the ACSC agencies to tackle 
cyber security threats by:

• increasing the capacity of the national 
Computer Emergency Response Team 
(CERT) Australia to scale up their work 
with Australian businesses, in particular 
those providing critical services. The 
additional capacity will also improve CERT 
Australia’s technical capability to support 
businesses and to partner internationally 
to prevent and shut down malicious cyber 
activity; and
• funding new specialist officers for the 
Australian Crime Commission and 
the Australian Federal Police to tackle 
cybercrime. There will also be new training, 
including new modules in entry colleges 
and eLearning for existing personnel, 
which will boost the digital investigation 
skills of specialist officers to create a cyber 
smart law enforcement and criminal 
intelligence workforce. 


The Government will also explore with states 
and territories how best to ensure that law 
enforcement officers receive the training they 
need to fight cybercrime across the nation.

The technical environment is becoming more 
complex. Technologies that underpin and are 
used within cyberspace rapidly evolve and 
more traditional technologies are being used 
for new purposes. For example, as encryption 
technology becomes cheaper and more 
widely available, there is an opportunity for 
all users to access this technology to secure 
information and improve their cyber security. 
However, there is also a growing trend for 
groups and individuals to use encryption to 
hide illegal activity and motivate others to join 
their cause.

The Government supports the use of 
encryption to protect sensitive personal, 
commercial and government information. 
However, encryption presents challenges 
for Australian law enforcement and security 
agencies in continuing to access data essential 
for investigations to keep all Australians safe 
and secure. Government agencies are working 
to address these challenges.

While new cyber security vulnerabilities are 
emerging every day, many are becoming 
increasingly difficult to identify. The 
Government will increase the capacity of 
the Australian Signals Directorate to identify 
new and emerging threats to Australia’s 
cyber security and improve intrusion analysis 
capabilities. Through the 2016 Defence White 
Paper, the Government is also boosting 
Defence’s cyber security capacity and 
capability—this includes new resources to 
strengthen Defence’s cyber capabilities to 
protect itself and other critical Australian 
government systems from malicious cyber 
intrusion and disruption. 



WHAT IF MY SYSTEM HAS BEEN COMPROMISED? 

Businesses are encouraged to contact the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) 
Australia through the Australian Cyber Security Centre if they think they have been the 
target of a malicious cyber intrusion, particularly if there has been a threat to infrastructure. 
Faster identification may help to minimise the extent of potential damage. In time, the 
layered approach to threat sharing will help streamline reporting of incidents and build a 
more detailed picture of cyber threats to Australia.

The Government must also be ready to 
respond to incidents when they occur. Cyber 
incidents do not necessarily need a cyber 
response and the Government can draw on a 
range of options, including law enforcement, 
diplomatic, economic or even—as a last 
resort—military responses to a cyber attack. In 
order to ensure we are prepared to respond 
to a significant cyber security event and 
to improve our existing exercise practices, 
the Government will work with other 
governments, businesses and international 
partners to expand our existing cyber incident 
management arrangements and exercise 
program to ensure we can operate together in 
a crisis.

CYBERSTORM EXERCISE 

CyberStorm is an international cyber security exercise program led by the United States. 
Each successive CyberStorm has grown in size and complexity, with over 1000 players 
participating globally in CyberStorm V in 2016. Participating in CyberStorm allows Australia 
to assess its own capabilities using real world scenarios. It also strengthens our relations 
with international peers and tests these operational relationships in real time. Cyber 
security exercises are one of the most effective tools businesses can employ to demonstrate 
potential whole-of-business impacts of a cyber attack,



RAISE THE BAR

While detecting and responding to cyber 
intrusions is important, even more important 
is to harden our networks and systems and 
make them less vulnerable to intrusions. In 
this case, prevention is definitely better than 
the cure.

Although some organisations may be 
implementing international cyber security 
standards that all organisations can achieve, 
others are not doing so. In our interconnected 
world, a solid baseline of cyber security 
practice is critical to achieving confidence 
online.

Self-regulation and a national set of simple, 
voluntary guidelines co-designed with the 
private sector will help organisations improve 
their cyber security resilience. As suggested 
by the private sector, these guidelines will be 
based on the Australian Signals Directorate’s 
Strategies to Mitigate Targeted Cyber 
Intrusions. These strategies will continue 
to be updated to keep pace with evolving 
technologies and innovative responses to 
cyber security challenges. 

While in its infancy in Australia, the rapidly 
growing cyber insurance market may help 
enforce improved cyber security performance.

ASX 100 listed businesses will have the 
opportunity to improve their cyber security 
governance by participating in voluntary 
governance ‘health checks’. The governance 
health checks will enable boards and senior 
management to better understand their 
cyber security status and how they compare 
to similar organisations. In time, these health 
checks (similar to the United Kingdom’s 
FTSE 350 governance health checks) will be 
available for public and private organisations, 
tailored to size and sector.

Small businesses often find it challenging to 
allocate resources to do cyber security well. 
Without adequate cyber security they can 
become the soft underbelly or back door into 
connected organisations. The Government 
will provide support for small businesses to 
have their cyber security tested by certified 
practitioners.

The Government will also support the 
Council of Registered Ethical Security Testers 
(CREST) Australia New Zealand to expand its 
certification of information security testing 
services.

CREST AUSTRALIA NEW ZEALAND 

The Council of Registered Ethical Security Testers (CREST) Australia New Zealand is a 
not-for-profit cyber security standards organisation where member companies become 
CREST Approved if they meet appropriate governance standards. CREST Australia New 
Zealand then provides accreditation and certification for employees and contractors of 
CREST Approved Member Companies through practical exams in penetration testing 
and soon other in-demand areas of cyber security. CREST certified practitioners, while 
being attached to CREST Approved Companies with good governance, give businesses in 
Australia and the region the confidence that testing of the cyber security of their networks 
and systems is done by skilled cyber security professionals.



Cyber espionage activities target Australian 
Government networks almost daily and as 
a result Government systems have been 
compromised. In 2013, the Australian National 
Audit Office completed an audit of seven 
agencies’ compliance with the Government’s 
cyber security policies and found most fell 
well short. These Government agencies are 
responding to the audit in order to continue 
to improve security.

To take action to better protect itself, the 
Government will:

• undertake a rolling program of 
independent assessments of Government 
agencies’ implementation of the Australian 
Signals Directorate’s Strategies to Mitigate 
Targeted Cyber Intrusions; 
• fund independent cyber security 
assessments of Government agencies at 
higher risk of malicious cyber activity and 
develop a framework that helps those 
agencies address findings; and
• increase the capacity of the Australian 
Signals Directorate to conduct vulnerability 
assessments of Government agencies 
and provide technical security advice on 
emerging technologies and vulnerabilities.


These assessments will help ensure 
appropriate action is being taken to 
manage cyber risks and that agencies have 
the right measures in place to respond to 
malicious cyber activity. The results from 
these assessments will inform further action 
to ensure all Government agencies are a 
harder target for cyber attack. The work on 
emerging technologies will also help inform 
the Australian Cyber Security Centre’s advice 
to the public and private sectors.

ICT supply chains have evolved with a diversity 
of ICT products and services being provided 
by a broad range of vendors. Products are 
routinely deployed and serviced globally. 
This has increased competition and lowered 
costs. As a nation with limited local ICT 
manufacturing, Australia has little control 
over the manufacture of these products and 
relies on services from a range of domestic 
and international organisations. A diverse and 
global supply chain can introduce risk. 

The Government will develop guidance for its 
agencies to consistently manage supply chain 
security risks for ICT equipment and services. 
In time, this work will be used to help inform 
the private sector.

GLOBAL 
RESPONSIBILITY 
AND INFLUENCE

AUSTRALIA ACTIVELY 
PROMOTES AN OPEN, FREE 
AND SECURE CYBERSPACE

To achieve our goal, the Government will:

• appoint Australia’s first Cyber Ambassador.
• publish an international cyber engagement strategy.
• champion an open, free and secure Internet that enables all countries to 
generate growth and opportunity online.
• partner internationally to shut down safe havens and prevent malicious 
cyber activity, with a particular focus on the Indo-Pacific region.
• build cyber capacity in the Indo-Pacific region and elsewhere, including 
through public–private partnerships.




Cyber security is a critical issue for Australia’s 
international cooperation. Cyberspace is 
already a core foreign policy issue and a 
central theme of Australia’s diplomatic efforts. 
Developing norms of state behaviour, the 
application of international law, Internet 
governance and cyber innovation are regularly 
discussed at multilateral forums and by 
Presidents and Prime Ministers. 

Australia needs to partner internationally to 
ensure our cyber engagement advances our 
security and economic interests, as well as 
our values. The Government will publish an 
international engagement strategy to help 
guide our bilateral and regional cooperation 
on cyber security.

But the private sector and research 
community can and must be part of the 
international cyber agenda—only then 
can we promote all Australians’ interests 
in cyberspace. 

Australia advocates for an open, free and 
secure Internet based on our values of free 
speech, privacy and the rule of law. We will 
continue to promote that opportunities 
provided by the Internet be available to all 
people, advocating against state censorship 
of the Internet. The newly appointed Cyber 
Ambassador will lead Australia’s efforts on this 
front together with a coordinated approach to 
cyber capacity building in our region.

ACTIONS SO FAR

• Australia chaired the United Nations Group of Governmental Experts in 2012–13 
that found existing obligations under international law are applicable when 
operating in cyberspace.
• Australia has played an important role in advancing risk reduction and conflict 
prevention through leading on the ASEAN Regional Forum cyber work plan 
adopted by Ministers in August 2015. 
• In 2015, Australia joined the Freedom Online Coalition—a partnership of 29 
governments working to advance Internet freedom. 
• The Australian Federal Police works with policing agencies throughout the 
Indo-Pacific region on training and capacity building initiatives to counter 
cybercrime. For example, the Cyber Safety Pasifika initiative is a collaborative 
project between the Pacific Islands Chiefs of Police and the Australian Federal 
Police. It has now been launched in 14 Pacific Island countries and has trained 
40 Pacific Island instructors to deliver cyber safety education in their own 
countries and mentoring support in other Pacific Island countries. Over 72,000 
children and young people in the Pacific have now attended its education and 
awareness workshops.




• In 2013, Australia joined the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime, 
otherwise known as the Budapest Convention. The Convention codifies what 
constitutes a criminal offence in cyberspace and streamlines international 
cybercrime cooperation between signatory states.
• The national Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) Australia presently 
chairs the steering committee of the Asia Pacific Computer Emergency 
Response Team (comprising 28 teams from 20 economies across the region) 
and shares threat information with other response teams around the world. 
• The Australian Attorney-General’s Department provides assistance to Pacific 
Island countries to reform their criminal justice frameworks to address 
cybercrime.
• In parallel to our cyber security partnerships, the Government is enhancing 
cooperation with international partners to detect and prevent terrorists’ use of 
the Internet and counter violent extremism online. This includes Australia being 
a lead partner in the East Asia Summit and Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation’s 
efforts to counter online extremism and combat online terrorist propaganda.


AN OPEN, FREE AND SECURE INTERNET

Several countries currently remain determined 
to impose constraints on the open nature of 
the Internet. 

Australia has consistently advocated for an 
open, free and secure Internet based on our 
values of freedom of speech, right to privacy 
and rule of law. Australia will continue to 
promote the opportunities provided by the 
Internet to be available to all, advocating 
against state censorship of the Internet.

Three core principles guide Australia’s 
international cyber engagement:

• The current way the Internet is governed, 
involving the private sector and the 
community as equal partners with 
governments, is the most effective model. 
This multi-stakeholder model of Internet 
governance delivers economic benefit 
and social opportunity while balancing 
fundamental human rights, such as 
freedom of expression and privacy. 
• State behaviour in cyberspace is governed 
by international law and reinforced by 
agreed norms of state behaviour and 
practical confidence building measures to 
reduce the risk of conflict. 
• Developing cyber capacity internationally 
helps to close the digital and economic 
divide between developed and developing 
nations and, in doing so, enhances 
Australia’s national security and export 
opportunities. 




By increasing mutual understanding, we can 
also help to reduce tension between states 
and the risk of miscalculation. Australia will 
continue to promote peacetime norms for 
acceptable state behaviour in cyberspace, 
which include that states should: 

• prevent and refrain from online activity that 
damages or impairs critical infrastructure; 
• facilitate (and not hinder) the critical 
work of other national Computer 
Emergency Response Teams in protecting 
online security; 
• live up to their responsibilities in 
investigating and policing malicious activity 
online emanating from their national 
territory and responding to requests for 
cooperative action; and
• not conduct or knowingly support 
cyber-enabled theft of intellectual 
property, with the intent of providing 
competitive advantage to companies or 
commercial sectors. 


CYBER POLICY DIALOGUES

In 2014-15 Australia opened formal multi-agency cyber policy dialogues with China, India, 
Japan and the Republic of Korea to strengthen our partnerships in Asia. Australia also has a 
longstanding cyber policy dialogue with New Zealand since 2012.

These dialogues provide a foundation for practical cooperation, allowing us to strengthen 
existing bilateral ties, share valuable cyber threat information, exchange views and 
advocate for Australia’s interests. For example, the Government uses the dialogues to 
promote an open, free and secure Internet and emphasise the importance of norms of 
behaviour for stability in cyberspace.

SHUT DOWN SAFE HAVENS

Partnerships between Australia and other 
countries are critical to developing mutual 
confidence and ensuring there are no safe 
havens for cyber criminals and other malicious 
cyber actors. They also allow us to work 
internationally to stop cyber attacks and track 
down perpetrators. Australia will continue to 
invest in these relationships and in raising the 
cyber security capacity of our region.

Most cybercrime originates from overseas. 
Partnering internationally to prevent and shut 
down malicious cyber activity and build 

capacity helps target cyber security risks at 
their source and spreads resilience, paying 
dividends for Australia’s cyber security. 

It also helps protect Australian businesses. 

Australia will work even more closely with and, 
where necessary, support our international 
partners in preventing cyber attacks and 
shutting down safe havens for cybercrime. 



BUILD CYBER CAPACITY NEAR AND FAR

Practical action and partnership are critical to 
tackling cyber criminals and to prevent them 
from proliferating, particularly in our region. A 
comprehensive, joined-up approach on cyber 
security by Australia and our partners must 
also be grounded in mutual trust.

The Government will increase the extent of our 
activity and partner internationally, particularly 
in the Indo-Pacific region, to help build 
capacity against malicious cyber activities. 

This will include sharing techniques to combat 
cybercrime, and enabling close collaboration 
between national computer emergency 
response teams.

SHARING AUSTRALIA’S EXPERTISE IN CYBER SECURITY 

In 2015 at the Global Conference on CyberSpace in The Hague, Australia became a 
founding partner of the Global Forum on Cyber Expertise to improve cyber capacity 
building (e.g. sharing our skills with and learning from other countries). Through the Forum, 
Australia will bring its expertise and strengths to partner with countries in our region to 
mitigate cyber attacks.

capability is crucial for 
Australia to be a global leader

GROWTH AND 
INNOVATION

AUSTRALIAN BUSINESSES GROW 
AND PROSPER THROUGH CYBER 
SECURITY INNOVATION

To achieve our goal, the Government will:

• establish a Cyber Security Growth Centre with the private sector to 
coordinate a national cyber security innovation network that pioneers 
cutting edge cyber security research and innovation.
• promote Australian cyber security products and services for development 
and export, with a particular focus on the Indo-Pacific region.
• work with business and the research community to better target cyber 
security research and development to Australia’s cyber security challenges.




Future economic growth in Australia will 
be boosted by access to new markets and 
the development of new forms of wealth 
creation. Disruptive technologies will open 
up new business opportunities, but many of 
these depend on trust and confidence in the 
security of cyberspace. Getting cyber security 
right will mean Australia is a secure and 
dynamic location for business diversification 
and investment.

Cyber security is one of the fastest growing 
sectors in many national economies and 
Australia is well placed to use our home-grown 
capabilities to develop business opportunities 
in this increasingly connected world. 

Our domestic cyber security sector, though 
small, has a good reputation internationally. 
To ensure we capitalise on these assets, 
the Government will help create the right 
environment to incubate cyber security 
research, development and start-ups.

RECENT ACHIEVEMENTS

Australia’s domestic innovation and research industry is well regarded, supported by 
targeted efforts from both government and the private sector. 

• Cyber security is one of nine Government National Science and Research Priorities. 
• Australian businesses are taking advantage of cyber opportunities. In recent years, 
home-grown cyber security online businesses have won Australian Export and 
Innovation awards for their export success and their unique products and services.
• Cyber security innovators are winning international acclaim—and out-competing 
overseas counterparts for venture capital to commercialise solutions to complex cyber 
security challenges.


ENABLE CYBER SECURITY BUSINESSES TO DEVELOP AND 
PROSPER

Cyberspace presents enormous opportunities 
for Australian businesses. We bring technical 
innovation, a skilled workforce and the 
experience gained from early adoption of 
technology across our economy. We need 
to harness this expertise and achieve scaled 
success for Australia’s economy and security 
to benefit from our strong cyber security 
R&D foundations.

More broadly, focused cyber security 
services will support trust and confidence in 
Australian businesses operating online. The 
Government’s commitment to cyber security 
will help businesses diversify and foster 
new markets, laying the foundations for a 
prosperous future. The Government will also 
promote Australia’s cyber security sector to 
the expanding global market for trusted cyber 
security services, which at around eight per 
cent a year, is expanding twice as fast as global 
economic growth. 



SUPPORT FOR ENTREPRENEURS

The National Innovation and Science Agenda is helping innovators commercialise good 
ideas. A number of the initiatives support start-ups and entrepreneurs, including:

• enhancing the visa system to attract the best and brightest entrepreneurial talent and 
skills to Australia
• making changes to the tax treatment of Early Stage Venture Capital Limited 
Partnerships to attract more investment into our high potential start-ups
• promoting investment in innovative, high-growth potential start-ups by providing 
concessional tax treatment for investors
• the Incubator Support Program, growing the next generation of innovative and high 
performing Australian businesses
• investing $36 million over five years in a Global Innovation Strategy to improve Australia’s 
international innovation and science collaboration
• supporting commercialisation of research from CSIRO, other research organisations and 
universities through an early stage innovation fund.


ENABLE CYBER SECURITY R&D AND INNOVATION

The Government is investing over $30 million 
to establish an industry-led Cyber Security 
Growth Centre to create business 
opportunities for Australia’s cyber security 
sector and improve Australian businesses’ 
cyber security.

The Cyber Security Growth Centre was 
announced in December 2015 as part of 
the Government’s National Innovation and 
Science Agenda and will develop a national 
plan to grow Australia’s cyber security sector. 
It is part of the Government’s Industry Growth 
Centres initiative and will coordinate cyber 
security research and innovation for national 
benefit and enable Australia to become a 
global leader in cyber security solutions and 
services. This will generate investment and 
jobs for the economy.

In addition, the Cyber Security Growth 
Centre will provide strategic coordination of 
a national cyber security innovation network 
that links cyber security innovation hubs 
and cyber security R&D around Australia and 
early-adopter businesses and government 
agencies. It will provide the national 
mechanism for cross-sector collaboration 
and investment in nationally-significant cyber 
security infrastructure and frameworks that 
are not singularly commercially-viable. To take 
advantage of the ‘fourth industrial revolution’ 
generated by cyberspace, governments, 
businesses and the research community will 
come together to link Australian research 
and start-up incubation with commercial 
opportunities. The Growth Centre will also 
work to improve the workforce skills of 
the sector and seek opportunities for the 
Australian cyber security sector to access 
global markets. This will help grow Australia’s 
cyber security sector and help all Australians 
and businesses be more secure online.



Data61, CSIRO’s digital powerhouse, will also 
contribute to the national cyber security 
innovation network through its cyber security 
research and collaboration with the private 
sector and by connecting the network 
internationally through initiatives such as the 
Security Innovation Network (SINET). 

The industry-led Growth Centre and its 
innovation network will support and inform 
the Government’s National Science and 
Research Priority on cyber security by guiding 
and leveraging existing government measures 
at the federal, state and local levels to 
improve research commercialisation, business 
innovation and competitiveness. 

For example, the Growth Centre will identify 
cyber research and technology gaps or 
priorities for industry, and inform the science 
and research community of industry needs 
and commercial opportunities. It will also 
work with other Growth Centres to identify 
cyber security challenges in other sectors.

The Growth Centre will also complement 
other initiatives under this Strategy, including 
the joint cyber threat sharing centres, to 
support solutions to emerging cyber security 
threats; and academic centres of cyber 
security excellence (discussed in the next 
chapter), by providing tertiary students with 
hands on experience in solving cyber security 
challenges before they graduate.

DATA61—AUSTRALIA’S LARGEST DATA 
INNOVATION GROUP

Formed in 2015, Data61 has already established an impressive network of partnerships 
across industry, government and academia, quickly becoming Australia’s largest data 
innovation group. 

To capitalise on the emerging data-driven economy, Data61 is developing ‘leap ahead’ 
technologies to enable industry and government to be at the cutting edge of cyber 
security. The strategic objectives for Data61 are closely aligned with this Strategy, reiterating 
the importance of cyber security in a data-driven future.

Data61’s mission is to help Australia create new technology-based industries. Cyber security 
is one of those industries and underpins all others. To achieve this, Data61 is focused on 
national alignment with global context, fostering a global innovation network—connecting 
academia, corporations, start-ups, governments, investors and entrepreneurs around the 
world. In 2016, Data61 will also bring the Security Innovation Network, SINET, to Australia, 
a ‘super-connector’ for cyber security innovation based in the US. The Australian network, 
to be known as SINET61, will connect to a series of global activities and will build on 
SINET’s existing annual events in Silicon Valley, New York, Washington DC and London that 
bring together cyber security entrepreneurs and start-ups with venture capitalists and 
angel investors.
