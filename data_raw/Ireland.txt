Executive Summary
The National Cyber Security Strategy (2015-2017) sets out how Ireland will engage with a
dynamic and challenging aspect of developments in digital technology, setting out the
Government's approach to facilitating the resilient, safe and secure operation of
computer networks and associated infrastructure used by Irish citizens and businesses.
The development and proliferation of Information and Communications Technology
(ICTs) has resulted in dramatic improvements in quality of life, the delivery of new and
innovative services, and sweeping changes in the way in which businesses operate.
However the growing use of these technologies has resulted in society becoming, to a
degree, dependent on the ongoing operation and resilience of these systems. A range of
threats have emerged to the safe and secure operation of ICT networks, emanating from
a diverse set of sources. These threats can be loosely categorised as hacking, cybercrime, hacktivism and cyber espionage. Equally, reliance on these networks and systems
has led to risks engendered by human error, software and equipment failures and even
extreme weather events. This document engages with these various threats and hazards,
sets out the high level strategic goals that form the basis of national policy in this area
and establishes the measures that will be taken in respect of each.

In particular, the Strategy includes the establishment of the National Cyber Security
Centre within the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and
details how that body will engage with its three primary areas of responsibility;
government networks, personal and business systems, and the protection of critical
national infrastructure. This will build on the existing Computer Security Incident
Response Team (CSIRT-IE), established in late 2011.

1. Introduction
1.1 Background
The National Cyber Security Strategy (2015-2017) sets out how Ireland will engage with a
dynamic and challenging aspect of developments in digital technology. The use of
internet technologies and ICT more generally to enable government, business and
individuals to deliver, participate and inform themselves has been transformative, but
has also opened up vectors for new types of attack. The fact that the digital domain
encompasses all information infrastructures accessible via the Internet (or otherwise),
and transcends territorial boundaries makes this arena far more complex and potentially
dangerous than would otherwise be the case.

In 2013 the World Economic Forum identified cyber-related threats as one of the highest
of all global risks from both the perspective of impact and likelihood1, a finding mirrored
at a national level in the 2014 National Risk Assessment2. The State, critical
infrastructure, businesses and citizens depend upon the reliable functioning of
information and communication technologies and of the Internet. Disruption to these
systems, regardless of the source, poses a direct threat to the functioning of the State
and the economy, and can have profound effects on the daily life of millions of citizens.
The Internet is already critical to the economic and social well-being of the State.
Moreover, it possesses enormous potential to make an even greater contribution to
economic and social development. Any threat to its resilience and security therefore
requires a robust and coherent response, both nationally and at an EU and international
level.

This Strategy presents a cross-government framework for ensuring cyberspace remains
safe, secure and reliable, with an emphasis on task-sharing and building trust
relationships between the State, public and private partners, academia and civil society.

2. Context - People, Economy, and State
2.1 Citizens
Cyber security is not limited to the application of technical solutions to improve the
security of networks, devices or data. Rather, the nature of the challenge is such that a
diverse range of measures are required, including the delivery of timely and appropriate
regulatory responses by governments, inducting an ongoing process of technological
adaptation and improvement and fostering a cultural understanding of the importance
of the issue. Ensuring that each of these tasks are delivered is a prerequisite for open,
free and safe access to cyberspace, and confidence that their personal data will be
processed in accordance with data protection principles enshrined in law, notably
national legislation, the European Union Treaties and the European Convention on
Human Rights. The Internet is a resource to which all citizens can and should have
access. As an information-led society, Irish citizens socialise, entertain, communicate,
learn, transact, and to varying degrees, live, online. Protecting this lifestyle and
individuals’ personal data is a prerequisite for prosperity, social development and the
protection of human rights.

2.2 Economy
Ireland’s economy depends on effective and secure digital infrastructures for sustained
growth and development. The digital economy contributes 5% of national GDP and is
growing at approximately 20% annually. There are few sectors that do not rely on ICTs
for their operations, including a wide range of critical economic infrastructure such as
electricity, gas, financial services and water supply. Nine out of the top ten global
software companies, all of the top ten global ICT companies, and the top ten “born on
the Internet” companies possess significant operations in Ireland. Protecting and
sustaining this investment, which provides employment for over 100,000 people, is a
vital priority for Ireland. Securing the long term future of this sector is of crucial
importance to the economy, and within this sector information security represents a
particular growth opportunity for Ireland. There is a real potential for Ireland to become
a cyber-security hub on the basis of the nascent cloud computing and big data sector
developing in the State.

2.3 Risks
The diverse ways in which network connected technologies are used, together with the
extremely widespread proliferation of devices, means that a very wide range of risks
have already arisen, both in terms of the type of threat and in terms of origin. The type
of threat ranges from relatively low level attempts to generate publicity, to extract
banking or other information, through to large scale data exfiltration and even sabotage
of ICT systems. In some cases, attacks have resulted in physical damage to equipment
and infrastructure. The origins of such attacks range from lone individuals to criminal
groups, and in some cases likely include Nation States seeking to gather intelligence or to
damage or degrade infrastructure. Incidents arising through extreme weather, human
error and hardware or software failure also pose significant risks to individuals,
businesses and public administration.

In a great number of cases, the risks to individuals, companies and the State are similar,
and can be mitigated by the application of the same responses, including good practice
such as business continuity planning, keeping software up to date or ensuring that
individuals are aware of risks that arise online, and trained to deal with them. In some
cases however, more specific and complex threats arise, such as in those cases where
businesses control large amounts of data or operate critical infrastructure; in these
instances more severe risks arise and a more involved set of responses is required. On a
national level, Ireland faces a more complex set of risks than many other countries. The
presence of a large number of data centric international companies here, and the
growing number of data centres present in the State mean that the potential for
reputational damage is an important consideration.

2.4 Government
A number of initiatives have been introduced by the Irish Government which optimise
and promote use of information systems for economic and social growth.


The Government’s National Broadband Plan aims to ensure that all citizens
and businesses have access to reliable high speed broadband, opening up
new business, economic and social opportunities.

National Cyber Security Strategy: Securing our Digital Future



Ireland’s National Digital Strategy “Doing More with Digital”, published in
June 2013, is focused on increasing the extent and quality of online
engagement.



The eGovernment Strategy 2012-2015 report (April 2012), describes a
reformed public administration which is moving towards online channels for
public engagement and service delivery.



The national “Action Plan for Jobs” (2013), aims to provide sustainable
employment and seeks to improve economic infrastructures, encompassing
secure ICT, to make Ireland a more environmentally-friendly, safer and more
pleasant place in which to live and work.



The Public Service ICT Strategy published in January 2015 focuses on
leveraging improved efficiencies from innovative use of new and emerging
digital technologies for citizens and businesses.

The developing national and EU research agenda has also placed an emphasis on
research, both through the Digital Agenda and the Horizon 2020 Programme (which
includes a specific strand on Digital Security).

The majority of the services provided by the State rely, to some extent or other, on ICT
systems. These include basic but essential email and telephony services and a wide range
of databases containing the personal data of millions of citizens and the business data of
companies operating in the State. These systems also include a wide range of online
platform services, including those run by the likes of the Revenue Commissioners and
the Department of Agriculture, which are central to the business operations of these
bodies and of customers.

2.5 Critical National Infrastructure
Critical National Infrastructure (CNI) comprises essential services such as electricity,
water, transportation, telecommunications, commerce and health. The convergence of
networks and information systems now means that the provisioning of these services
substantially relies on the seamless operation of Information and Communication
Technologies. The systems, services, networks and infrastructures that underpin other

National Cyber Security Strategy: Securing our Digital Future

-6-

Critical Infrastructure, or provide essential services themselves, are called Critical
Information Infrastructure (or CII) and include telecommunications networks, the
Internet, terrestrial and satellite wireless networks.

While all infrastructure is at risk from damage or destruction by natural or manmade
events, damage to either CNI and CII could have negative consequences for national
security, the economy, or the well-being of citizens of the State. While measures have
long been in place to ensure the security of such infrastructure against damage from
conventional sources, there is a growing awareness of the risks posed to infrastructure
by cyber attack. However, there is a substantive difference between the traditional
realm, where kinetic attacks require a physical proximity and which are generally easily
attributed, and cyber attacks, where neither of these factors are necessarily present. The
growing sophistication and apparent proliferation of cyber attacks on infrastructure
means that this cannot be ignored. This Strategy contains a series of measures to
strengthen capacity in this area.

The extant Computer Security and Incident Response Team (CSIRT-IE) within the
Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources have been engaged in
general emergency planning processes in the State with the Principal Response Agencies
(including An Garda Síochána, the Health Service Executive and the Local Authorities),
Government Departments and other agencies overseen by the Office of Emergency
Planning (OEP) within the Department of Defence and the Government Task Force on
Emergency Planning, chaired by the Minister for Defence. This includes contributing to
the development of a National Framework for Emergency and Crisis Management in
Ireland, which aims to foster national resilience in the face of emergencies/crises, thus
minimising or mitigating the disruption of national life and achieving the optimum
outcome when an emergency occurs. The Government’s Cyber Security Strategy sets
out how Ireland will protect and improve the cybersecurity of Critical National
Infrastructure in the context of national emergency planning.

2.6 European and International Developments
Since 2001 there have been a number of EU and international measures aimed at
improving Network and Information Security. These have included the establishment of
the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) in 2005, the facilitation

-7-

of awareness raising events, training, cyber security exercises and the development of
policy proposals and platforms such as the 2009 Communication on Critical Information
Infrastructure Protection3. The 2010 Digital Agenda for Europe4 included a range of
actions designed to ensure greater trust and security online, including that Member
States would establish “… a well-functioning network of CERTs at national level covering
all of Europe” by the end of 2012. The EU Telecommunications Framework Directive
(2009/140/EC) already provides for mandatory and security requirements for
telecommunications operators. In 2013, the EU published a Cyber Security Strategy
focusing on 5 key pillars; namely improving cyber resilience, addressing cyber-crime,
facilitating improved cyber defence capabilities, research and industrial development
initiatives for industry and diplomatic initiatives focused on developing the rule of law
and norms of behaviour for States.

However, the increased threat level has led to a persistent concern that the EU was
losing ground in this area, and as such the Commission published a proposed Directive in
2013. This draft Directive, termed the Network and Information Security (NIS) Directive
has been the subject of intensive discussions at European Council and Parliament, and
will likely be agreed later in 2015. It sets out obligations for all Member States
concerning the prevention, handling of and response to cyber incidents and attacks
affecting information communications technology systems in some online businesses,
energy, transport, banking and financial services and health sectors. The draft Directive
also has a number of specific requirements, including:


the development of a strategy at national level;



the designation of a national competent authority or authorities;



the establishment and resourcing of one or more national computer security
incident response teams (CSIRTs);



the development of co-operation arrangements between Member States at
strategic and operational levels; and

the reporting of network and information security incidents and
conformance with risk management and security requirements for specific
undertakings providing information society services or operating critical
infrastructure in the energy, transport, banking and financial services and
health sectors.

3. Guiding Principles
The role of the State is to create a robust, stable and coherent regulatory framework for
protecting networks and infrastructure enterprises and private persons and to support
self-regulation in the private sphere. The principles that will be followed in this are set
out below.

3.1 Rule of Law
We will focus on applying the rule of law, and will work to ensure that Irish citizens’
rights under the Constitution and under the European Convention on Human Rights are
preserved at all times.

3.2 Subsidiarity
Because of the diverse ownership and operation of various ICT systems, the State cannot
assume sole responsibility for protecting cyberspace and the rights of citizens online. The
owners and operators of information and communication technology are primarily
responsible for protecting their systems and the information of their customers.

3.3 Risk Based Approach & Proportionality
Measures to increase the level of protection need to be informed by an assessment of
the risks and threats facing us, as individuals, businesses, public sector bodies and the
State as a collective whole. Furthermore such measures will need to be proportionate to
the respective risks and threats that we face.

4. Objectives


To improve the resilience and robustness of critical information infrastructure in
crucial economic sectors, and particularly in the public sector.



To continue to engage with international partners and international
organisations to ensure that cyber space remains open, secure, unitary and free
and able to facilitate economic and social development.



To raise awareness of the responsibilities of businesses and of private individuals
around securing their networks, devices and information and to support them in
this by means of information, training and voluntary codes of practice.



To ensure that the State has a comprehensive and flexible legal and regulatory
framework to combat cyber crime by An Garda Síochána that is robust,
proportionate and fair, and that accords due regard to the protection of
sensitive or personal data.



To ensure that the regulatory framework that applies to the holders of data,
personal or otherwise, is robust, proportionate and fair.



To build capacity across public administration and the private sector to engage
fully in the emergency management of cyber incidents.

5. Measures
5.1 Establish the National Cyber Security Centre
We will formally establish the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC) within the
Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. The NCSC will engage in
a comprehensive set of tasks around cyber security, with primary focus on securing
government networks, assisting industry and individuals in protecting their own systems,
and securing critical national infrastructure.

The process of developing a Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT-IE)
commenced in the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in
late 2011, on foot of a Government Decision. To date, CSIRT-IE has focussed on assisting
public sector organisations in their response to computer security incidents and
providing advice to reduce threat exposure. Some initial work has also been completed
on the two other core future aspects of the work of NCSC.

Over the life of this Strategy, the skillset and constituency base of the NCSC will be
developed as follows:


The NCSC will seek formal accreditation for the Government CSIRT (g/CSIRT),
which is critical in terms of peer recognition. This accreditation is expected in
early 2016;



Accreditation will be sought for a formal National CSIRT (n/CSIRT), while also
developing a limited capacity in the area of Industrial Control and SCADA
systems.

The mandate for the NCSC will include:


activities to reduce the vulnerability of critical systems and networks within the
State to incidents and cyber-attacks;



effective response when such attacks occur;



responsibility for the protection of critical information infrastructure (CIIP);

National Cyber Security Strategy: Securing our Digital Future

- 12 -



establishing and maintaining cooperative relationships with national and
international partners.

5.2 Network and Information Security for Public Bodies
We will introduce a series of measures to improve the network and information security
used by Government Departments and Agencies, including a comprehensive incident
reporting and escalation policy.

This will build on work already in progress involving an improved ability to detect and
respond to threats and attacks. The evolution of attack vectors and threats has resulted
in previous network security technologies becoming less effective and the adoption of a
defence in depth approach. This involves the use of a wider range of devices and
infrastructure in the service of network security. The NCSC's projects will ultimately yield
such a system: a constituency wide, federated, Security Incident and Event Management
(SIEM) system.

5.3 Fully implement the NISD by means of primary legislation
We will introduce primary legislation to give effect to the national cyber security
arrangements and to transpose the proposed European Union Directive on network and
information security. This process will be undertaken in a transparent and consultative
manner, involving regulatory impact analysis and legislative scrutiny by the Oireachtas.

5.4 Coherent international engagement
We will continue to engage in European and global discussions on network and
information security, including in the context of the global debate on the future of
internet governance. We continue to emphasise the ongoing need for a secure, resilient
internet architecture that fully encompasses the protection of fundamental rights online
and which continues to facilitate economic and social development.

We will also engage at European and international levels with key partners in delivering
policy measures to improve cyber security.

5.5 National Security and Policing
In recognition of its responsibilities for providing policing and security services to the
State, it is envisaged that An Garda Síochána will be in a position to offer appropriate
advice and guidance concerning preventative and investigative strategies. It will also be
in a position to draw on its liaison relationships with other security services in identifying
emerging threats, vulnerabilities and best practice preventative measures.

5.6 Cybercrime
The Minister for Justice and Equality will shortly bring forward legislation to give effect to
the provisions of the Budapest Convention on Cybercrime and Directive 2013/40/EU on
attacks against information systems. We will continue to work closely with that
Department and the recognised legal and regulatory agencies including An Garda
Síochána on the implementation of that legislation. This association will be formalised by
means of a Memorandum of Understanding, setting out the respective roles and duties
of each body.

5.7 Civil-Military Cooperation
The Defence Forces maintains a capability in the area of cyber security for the purpose of
protecting its own networks and users. There is already a strong culture of cooperation
between the NCSC and DF in areas such as development of technical skill sets, technical
information sharing and exercise participation. These arrangements will be formalised by
means of a Service Level Agreement with the Department of Defence, which will also
include a mechanism for sharing technical expertise in the event of a national cyber
incident or emergency.

5.8 Critical Infrastructure
We will continue to play a central role in the protection of critical national infrastructure,
including through the national emergency management system overseen by the
Government Taskforce on Emergency Planning and the Office of Emergency Planning in
the Department of Defence. As such, the Department of Communications, Energy and

National Cyber Security Strategy: Securing our Digital Future

- 14 -

Natural Resources will operate as Lead Government Department for emergency
situations relating to failures of, or attacks on, ICTs, and will operate in a secondary role
to other Departments in cases where incidents may have a cyber-security dimension.

5.9 Information Sharing
The dynamic nature of the threat environment means that clear, open and rapid access
and sharing of information across the full range of stakeholders is critical. CSIRT-IE has
been developing strong bilateral relationships with similar organisations in other
countries, and with ENISA, the European Network and Information Security Agency.
Equally, the unit has a formal and active information sharing role with other public sector
bodies, and with industry (including IRISS-CERT, a voluntary CERT).

The NCSC will expand its information sharing arrangements with national and
international stakeholders, and will focus particularly on making information on
developing issues public in a timely and relevant manner. In particular, the NCSC will
engage with Internet Service Providers on a protocol that might be implemented to
identify threats to the data and devices of their customers.

5.10 Education and training for Industry/SMEs
We will develop a programme of education and training, beginning with a revised Make
IT Secure website to help citizens and Small to Medium Enterprises (SME) better protect
themselves online. We will also develop a programme of structured exercises for critical
national infrastructure owners and for public sector bodies, in partnership with
international peers and the academic sector.

5.11 Public Awareness
We will work to foster a culture of cyber security across society, including through
cooperation with the education system, with industry and through the promotion of
events like European Cyber Security Month.

- 15 -

5.12 Relationships with Third Level Institutions
The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources has a long standing
relationship with the Centre for Cyber-crime Investigation in University College Dublin.
We will continue to develop and deepen such partnerships with third level institutions
through the use of Memoranda of Understanding to aid the sharing of knowledge,
experience and best practice, and to support the developing research agenda in this
sector.
