Cyber Security Strategy of Georgia
2012-2015

1

1. Introduction
The Government of Georgia publishes its Cyber Security Strategy for the first time. Large-scale cyber
attacks launched by Russia against Georgia in August 2008 have clearly demonstrated that the
national security of Georgia cannot be achieved without ensuring security of its cyberspace.
In the course of the Russian-Georgian war, Russian Federation engaged in targeted and massive cyber
attacks against Georgia alongside land, aerial and naval assault. These attacks showed that the
protection of cyberspace is as important for national security as land, maritime, and air defenses.
The Georgian Cyber Security Strategy is a principal document outlining state policy in the area of
cyber-security, reflecting strategic goals and guiding principles, and laying down action plans and
tasks. Based on this Strategy, the Government of Georgia will undertake actions facilitating safe
operation of state agencies, private sector and the public in cyberspace, secure electronic transactions
and unhindered functioning of Georgian economy and business.
The Georgian Cyber Security Strategy represents a part of the package of conceptual and strategic
documents developed in the framework of the National Security Review process. Consequently, the
Strategy is based upon the Threat Assessment Document for 2010-2013 and the National Security
Concept of Georgia.
The Strategy has been developed by the Permanent Inter-agency Commission under the auspices of
the National Security Council tasked to coordinate drafting national security strategic documents.

2. Basic Principles of Implementing the Georgian Cyber Security Policy
The National Security Concept of Georgia defines cyber security as one of the principal directions of
its security policy. Georgia aims to set up a system of cyber security that will facilitate resilience of
cyber infrastructure against cyber threats as well as will represent additional factor in the economic
growth and social development of the country. In this regard, it is necessary to adhere to the
following principles of cooperation:
 Whole-of-Government Approach. The Government of Georgia attaches great importance to
the security policy as well as institutionalization of mechanisms for implementation of the
policy components. In this regard, development of cooperation modalities between state
agencies is essential for ensuring cyber security, where such modalities facilitate whole-ofgovernment approach and unhindered, coordinated work of different state agencies in
planning and implementing cyber security policy.
 Public-private cooperation. Development of mechanisms for cooperation extending beyond
governmental agencies to public-private partnership is essential for ensuring cyber security.
Larger part of critical information systems of Georgia is owned by private businesses and
relevant experience and knowledge is mainly available in private companies. Consequently, it
is important to develop cooperation modalities that facilitate proper operation of critical
information systems as well as will offer additional incentives for economic growth.
 Active international cooperation. The Government of Georgia acknowledges that the no
single government can solely rely on its own resources in overcoming current challenges and
threats to cyber security. Georgia is a part of the global democratic community and therefore
is vulnerable to threats against this community. Accordingly, Georgia aims to actively
cooperate with its partners on cyber security issues in bilateral and multilateral formats.

3. Cyber Threats and Challenges
Georgia aims to develop a system of information security that is able to minimize harmful effects of
any cyber attack and allows rapid recovery of information infrastructure to being fully operational in
the aftermath of such attacks.
Establishment of electronic government leads to increased threats and challenges to critical
information systems of Georgia. At the same time, Georgia faces global threats and challenges that
endanger democratic societies in the international community. Therefore, planning and
implementation of the Georgian security policy should pay significant attention to the following
threats and challenges in cyberspace:
 Cyber war. In 2008, parallel to the military attacks, Georgian cyber space was exposed to the
Russian aggression. Potential adversaries of Georgia possess significant capabilities for
conducting new types of warfare in cyberspace. At the same time, Georgia faces recurrent
risk of massive cyber attacks.
 Cyber terrorism. Growing dependence of important areas of Georgian state management and
business on critical information systems leads to elevated cyber terrorism threats. Attacks
launched in cyberspace against the objects of critical information systems can significantly
affect state security.
 Cybercrime and other security threats. Security challenges for Georgia include categories of
cybercrime directed against critical information systems of Georgia and/or for the purpose of
obtaining secret information, economic sabotage and other politically motivated means. Also
lower-level acts against information/cyber security that jeopardize access to information and
proper operation of information systems.

4. Major Directions of the Georgian Cyber Security Policy
The main directions of the Georgian Cyber Security policy are as follows:


Research and analysis;



New legislative and regulatory framework;



Institutional coordination for ensuring cyber security;



Public awareness and education;



International cooperation.

4.1. Research and analysis
It is important to ensure that the legislative drafts, by-laws, guidelines, recommendations and actions
undertaken by Georgia in the area of cyber security are based upon research and analysis as a
prerequisite for efficiency of the cyber security policy.
In this regard, the following directions of research and analysis are necessary to implement state
policy in cyber security:


Study of other states' best practices and sharing experience;



Research the criteria and standards to identify objects of critical information systems;
 Resilience analysis of critical information systems;
 Analysis of the problems in the region regarding the cyber security.

4.2. New legislative framework
As of 2012, Georgia has not yet introduced specialized national cyber security laws. It is important to
establish legislative framework of cyber security that would facilitate development of effective and
efficient security mechanisms.
To improve legislative framework in the field cyber security, it is necessary to undertake the
following steps:

5



Introduction of legislative acts on information security;



Development of the regulatory framework to identify the critical information systems and
actions necessary for ensuring cyber security;



Introduction of the legal basis for Computer Emergency Response Team operations;



Ratification of the 2001 Council of Europe Convention Against Cybercrime;



Legal identification of an agency or agencies responsible for designation of information
security policies and undertaking coordinating functions;



Development of the contingency plans and recovery procedures.

4.3 Institutional coordination for ensuring cyber security
Ensuring cyber security requires clear definition of functions of the state agencies, establishment of
the inter-agency coordination mechanism to implement whole-of-government approach, and publicprivate cooperation.
The following actions are necessary to ensure the coordination in cyber security field:


Further development of the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT.GOV.GE);



Establishment of the 24/7 high-tech crime (cybercrime) international contact point as
required by the 2001Convention against Cybercrime;



Designation of the expert support team/unit in cybercrime cases;



Establishment of the format and modalities for public-private cooperation.

4.4. Public awareness and education
An important part of the Cyber Security Strategy of Georgia is to raise the public awareness and
increase relevant professional capacity.
In this regard, it is important to undertake the following actions:
 Establishment of the public awareness and educational programs on cyber security;

6

 Training of the staff and technical personnel of the critical information system subjects and
other interested organizations in order to learn international and local standards of
information security;
 Training of the specialized cybercrime experts in the area of handling electronic evidence
(cyber forensics);
 Support the science and research projects in cyber security;
 Creation of the research lab.

4.5. International cooperation
To develop the international cooperation in cyber security Georgia undertakes the following actions:


Strengthening relations on cyber security issues with international organizations (OECD,
EU, OSCE, NATO, UN, ITU) working in cyber security field as well as relevant national
authorities;



Active participation in international activities related to cyber security and support of the
relevant initiatives on a regional scale;



5. Mechanisms and Time-frames for Strategy Implementation
The Strategy will be implemented in 2012-2015. Agencies responsible for implementation of the
Strategy will take into account actions necessary for implementing this Strategy within relevant
policy areas.
Results of the Strategy implementation will be assessed annually and the annual assessment report
will be presented to the Permanent Inter-agency Commission for coordination of drafting national
security strategic documents at the National Security Council of Georgia.
