EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This National Information Security Strategy (NISS) for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA /
Kingdom) is in response to a Request for Proposal (RFP) issued by the Ministry of Communications
and Information Technology (MCIT), dated Muharram 1432H, January 2011 as an initiative from
Cabinet Resolution 82.
MCIT's NISS Objectives [1]:
1) Enable information to be used and shared freely and securely.
2) Increase the security, safety, and integrity of online information, while promoting the increased
use of information technology.
3) Develop resilience in information systems.
4) Increase awareness and education of security risks and responsibility of information protection.
5) Create a set of national guidelines for Information Security Management, Risk Management and
Business Continuity based on international standards and best practices.
The need for the National Information Security Strategy (NISS) is dictated by the complexity of
today's interconnected computer networks. Government agencies are no longer solely responsible for
the security of their information and Information Communications Technology (ICT) systems. In fact,
their networks have no boundaries because of the remote connectivity that extends them throughout
the world.
ICT security is now a primary driver that supports the Kingdom’s growth in new areas. The NISS is a
foundational element for this growth. While most countries recognize the need to better align
information security with the goals of their nations, many are still struggling to translate this
recognition into concrete plans of action. This NISS is a strategy for guiding the Kingdom to the
needed state of information protection with secure and resilient ICT infrastructures.
The ICT changes in our increasingly interdependent world are complex and rapid. National and
international interconnectivity create significant new vulnerabilities and present new types of threats
to the Kingdom's economic and cultural activities. These new threats could in some cases shutdown,
corrupt or even destroy critical ICT systems. In certain cases, an adversary might be able to seize
control and use an ICT system to directly harm or go against the Kingdom's interests. The potential
risk incurred by use of ICT systems must be adequately managed to achieve the productivity and
collaborative benefits such systems provide.
The NISS priority is Information Security (IS) for all government agencies and business sector. IS
requires the integration of people, processes, and technology. Each of these three (3) components
should be carefully managed, considering the capabilities and limitations of the other components.




People - This strategy suggests among other groups of people leveraging women and the Saudi
youth as a key element to a successful IS deployment.
Processes – By utilizing some of the key points here and leveraging the Kingdom’s existing laws,
Saudi Arabia is well positioned to implement the NISS.
Technology – Newer and better technology will always be available. The key is to utilize the
proper tools at the proper time.

When people, processes and technology are considered in total, they should provide for adequate
overall IS risk mitigation.

National Information Security Strategy

It is widely accepted that cyber-terrorism, cyber-war, and cyber-espionage are successful due to the
vulnerability of computer networks and critical infrastructures. These vulnerabilities have the
potential to place the Kingdom at significant additional risk, in part because of the rapidly growing
dependence of economic and financial activity on the ICT. A closer look at the relationships between
computer networks and critical infrastructures, their vulnerability to attack and the subsequent effect
on national security strongly suggest that the Kingdom needs to employ increased cyber and critical
infrastructure protection. A full assessment of those two (2) areas is outside the scope of the NISS. A
recommendation of the NISS is that separate strategies be developed for Cybersecurity and Critical
Infrastructure Protection (CIP), as they are important complements to the NISS and necessary for
comprehensive protection of the Kingdom’s vital national interests and assets.

NISS Vision
The NISS is an integrated strategy designed to meet the Kingdom's national information and ICT
security objectives. These objectives in turn support the achievement of the Kingdom's long-term
plans and strategy, which depend upon a secure, reliable and resilient information infrastructure. The
NISS is designed to bridge the gap from the Kingdom's current state of information security (IS) to its
future IS vision, which is:
The Saudi Arabian information society will have a secure, resilient foundation
whose information security is supported by world-class practices and highly
qualified Saudi practitioners.
The NISS vision includes the following successes:
1) A secure, reliable and resilient national ICT infrastructure
2) A highly capable human information security resource
3) A national information security environment and management structure built upon trust,
confidence, transparency and cooperation
4) A secure and dependable set of e-government services and supporting infrastructure throughout
the Kingdom that meet the security objectives of the Kingdom's ICT plans and strategies
5) A flourishing and continuing IS economic sector of research, innovation and entrepreneurial
activities

NISS General Objectives
The ten (10) NISS General Objectives are the guideposts for the Kingdom’s on-going and future
information security efforts. They were established to enable the Kingdom's information security
foundation and posture to improve in a coordinated and effective manner and support national ICT
goals and objectives. They also represent a top level statement of the NISS Elements and were
generated using the NISS objectives set by the Kingdom, as well as various objectives in the
Kingdom's national plans related to information and information security. The NISS General
Objectives are listed below:
O-1 ‒ Effective and Secure Information Security Environment
Work towards assuring that appropriate and consistent information security policies, directives,
guidance, practices and oversight are achieved within the Kingdom. This process shall be responsible
for the detailed implementation of the NISS objectives, and recommendations..
O-2 ‒ Information Systems and ICT Infrastructure Enhancement
Enhance the security, reliability, availability and resilience of the Kingdom’s ICT infrastructure and
information systems.

National Information Security Strategy

O-3 ‒ Human Resource
Improve the IS human resource and expand the capability of Saudi information security practitioners,
researchers, innovators and entrepreneurs, both men and women; and establish special programs for
training and awareness especially directed towards women and youth of all ages.
O-4 ‒ IS Threat Analysis and Mitigation
Establish an IS function and analysis capability to collect and analyze vulnerabilities, all-source
threats and risks to the Kingdom's ICT resources.
O-5 ‒ Reduction of On-going ICT Exploitation
Reduce and prevent exploitation of weak points in the Kingdom's information security (IS) by
employing the best international mitigation practices in local and national areas of highest IS risk.
O-6 ‒ IS Compliance and Tracking Processes
Maximize progress toward national improvement benchmarks and goals by implementing a
comprehensive compliance and tracking process, which ensures compliance with IS policies and
standards and measures the progress and status of the Kingdom's information security initiatives.
O-7 ‒ Research, Innovation and Entrepreneurship
Meet future IS needs by stimulating and directing the Kingdom's IS research and innovation programs
that have high potential for commercialization and IS breakthroughs, including cryptographic
interoperability, supply chain integrity, computer security and rapid and effective access control.
O-8 ‒ Maintenance of Information Security
Ensure adequate IS protection for the Kingdom by maintaining a continuous process that supports the
IS defensive posture for essential ICT infrastructures and information systems, and addresses new IS
threats and vulnerabilities.
O-9 ‒ National and International Cooperation
Achieve greater security for the Kingdom's information and ICT infrastructures by implementing new
domestic ICT security coordination and information sharing processes among stakeholders and by
leveraging international collaboration efforts.
O-10 ‒ Information Security Awareness and Responsibilities
Increase in all people their awareness of IS threats and vulnerabilities, as well as their understanding
of personal responsibilities to improve information security in their work environments and daily
lives.

NISS Elements
The objectives of each NISS Element were independently established and compared to the NISS
General Objectives for compatibility. The nine (9) Elements that compose the NISS are listed below.
NISS Elements
 Information Security Environment
 Policy and Regulation
 Risk Management and Assessment
 National ICT Infrastructure
 Human Resource
 Re-assessment and Audit
 National Cooperation and Sharing for Information Security
 International Cooperation and Sharing for Information Security
 Research and Innovation

The recommendations related to each NISS Element are as follows:

National Information Security Strategy

Information Security Environment
The first step is consideration of, and agreement by, the Kingdom on a secure and effective
information security environment. International research from Asia, Europe and North America
showed that a centrally-managed information security is the most effective and efficient way to
protect their respective nations. Because of domestic political factors, few countries are able to
implement an effective national organization that covers all government agencies, as well as the
business sector. The current ICT environment with borderless infrastructure connectivity makes the
threat, vulnerabilities and risk that one organization faces heavily dependent upon actions (or lack of
actions) of other entities inside and outside the Kingdom. Such interconnection makes all systems of
the government susceptible to compromise. A central national information security environment for
managing information security is recommended to provide better coordination and security across the
Kingdom’s information and ICT infrastructure.

Policy and Regulation
This strategy recommends forming agreements, and the development and adoption of a set of national
information security policies that form the IS framework for the Kingdom. This, in turn, will lead to
national standards and best practices.
In addition, based upon a gap analysis, a periodic review and updating of the Kingdom's regulations
and laws is recommended to take into account the constantly evolving legal challenges and situations
presented by the globally interconnected internet.

Risk Management and Assessment
This strategy recommends a national framework of information security risk assessment processes
and management tools to enable comparison of assessments using the same basic criteria. Managing
risk is essential, as there is no longer an absolute defense against adverse events and attacks affecting
information and ICT systems.

National ICT Infrastructure
This strategy recommends updating and hardening the ICT infrastructure of the Kingdom to a state of
acceptable resilience. Doing so requires evolutionary security architecture and is a longer-term but
vital element of the NISS.

Human Resource
The Kingdom has long recognized and supported extensive vocational, educational and professional
development of Saudi citizens. The NISS extends this recognition with a specific focus on the areas of
IT, ICT and ICT security. A key recommendation in this section is to identify work-ready Saudis
(Male/Female) with computer skills and employ them in the near future to improve the information
security of the Kingdom.

Re-assessment and Audit
The recommendation is to develop a comprehensive national assessment, re-assessment and audit
framework, based upon best international practices. An Information Security Assessment is a formal,
systematic process of data gathering, regarding information security measures that are in place,
compared to an established set of criteria (ISO 27001), in order to determine what needs exist.
The audit portion of the framework is a review of an organization's IT systems management operation
and technical controls, and the related processes, from a security viewpoint. The ultimate goal of an
Information Security Audit is to assist management in understanding the relationship between the
technical controls and the risks to the organization that they affect. The Information Security Audit
also results in the determination of regulatory compliance, in the wake of legislation (such as the KSA
privacy and crime laws) that specifies how organizations must deal with information security.

National Information Security Strategy

National and International Cooperation
The NISS recommends expanding internal cooperation and communication processes regarding
information system attacks, threats, vulnerabilities, mitigation techniques and best practices between
the Kingdom's organizations. Increased national coordination is required at all levels of the
government, as well as between the government and private industry and the people. The NISS
outlines several methods to enhance information sharing at the national level to include creating a
centralized operations center for the collection and analysis of new ICT threats, information loss, theft
and penetrations, and attempted theft and penetrations of ICT systems. The operations center should
be connected to existing technical capabilities dispersed throughout the government and private
industry.
There are additional benefits in having official Saudi representation in various international
organizations involved with information security and cybersecurity. Topics that would benefit the
Kingdom include international standards development, global ICT security policy, cybercrime
initiatives and research. In addition, international strategic engagements and partnerships can
strengthen the Kingdoms ICT and cyber defenses through collaboration and information sharing on
emerging threats and vulnerabilities and appropriate mitigation technologies.

Research and Innovation
Research and innovation take longer to bear fruit, but the NISS has identified some initial projects,
which are valuable and designed to expand the capability and success rate of researchers, innovators
and entrepreneurs. These include encouragement and support through special workshops and a virtual
support staff for translating ideas and research into patents. In addition, national coordination of the
Kingdom’s important information security needs, and the success of designs that meet those needs,
will help build a more active and relevant Saudi capability to meet the current and future needs.

Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection
The NISS is a strategy that stands on its own. However, the Kingdom needs two (2) additional
complimentary key strategies ‒ Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection. While all three
(3) strategies have elements in common and the NISS has elements unique to each, implementation of
the NISS still leaves some of the critical elements of Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure
Protection unaddressed. Therefore, additional Kingdom strategies for Cybersecurity and Critical
Infrastructure Protection must be developed and implemented in coordination with the NISS, to cover
the areas the NISS does not cover. Collectively, these strategies provide the comprehensive and
integrated efforts for national infrastructures required to support the Kingdom’s ICT objectives, which
in turn support the Kingdom's national security and economic security objectives.

Conclusion
Upon successful implementation of the NISS, the supporting ICT security foundation should be in
place to support the achievement of the Kingdom's Long Term Vision in 2024

INTRODUCTION

2.1 THE NISS PROJECT
The need for a National Information Security Strategy (NISS) is dictated by the complexity of today's
interconnected computer networks. This NISS for the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA/Kingdom) is in
response to a Request for Proposal (RFP) issued by the Ministry of Communications and Information
Technology (MCIT), dated Muharram 1432H, January 2011.
The NISS Scope [1] includes the following components:
1) The NISS should address the security of all information in all areas of people’s activities, and
should enable information to be used and shared freely and securely.
2) “People’s activities” includes public, private and individuals. NISS is a national strategy covering
all aspects of information security as it is used and practiced in the government sector, the private
sector and by individuals.
3) The strategy deals with national information security at the national level that applies to all
sectors.
This strategy was researched, developed and produced by a highly experienced group of international
senior consultant teamed with national consultants. Each of the consultants has personal experience in
either drafting national information security strategies, implementing national security strategies or
both.

2.4 APPROACH TO THE NISS
The initial task in creating the NISS was to research existing international information security
strategies, approaches and guidelines and best practices for what would be the best approach for the
Kingdom. This task also included determining the current state of information security activities and
challenges faced by government agencies. The Kingdom's major national plans and strategies were
reviewed and the objectives relevant to each NISS Element were identified.
The status of the Kingdom's information security was determined through intensive efforts with strong
support by Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) in the form of
documents about the Kingdom's information security activities. Input from the NISS organizational
and national data collection efforts from the recent data call by the minister of MCIT have been
considered. The Arabic Survey sent out with the minister's letter and the online multiple choice NISS
survey results have been reviewed.
The consultants used their experience and various evaluation criteria to determine the best analytical
approaches for developing each NISS Element. Next, top level NISS general objectives for the
Kingdom were developed and made consistent with the Kingdom's objectives contained in national
plans and strategies. Specific objectives were developed for each NISS Element. Strategies to achieve
each NISS Element objective were then developed and supported by a set of Implementation
Initiatives.
The relationship between the NISS General Objectives and the NISS Element Objectives is illustrated
in section 3.0 NISS General Objectives, Figure 3.0-2 Relationship of Each NISS General Objective to
the Objectives of Each NISS Element.

2.5 SUMMARY OF FINDINGS OF KSA'S CURRENT INFORMATION SECURITY
POSTURE AND ACTIVITIES










A set of centralized information security policies and standards is not evident.
Each organization has implemented ICT security in their own manner with little or no consistency
of architecture, policy or communication across organizations.
The national architectural standards and requirements that Yesser has developed for connection to
the Government System Backbone are an exception, but only extend to the organization’s
connection point and not inside the enterprise ICT infrastructure.
IS risk assessment and management is not under a common national framework, so results from
various ministries and organizations cannot be compared on the same scale for senior
management decisions.
A large unmet need exists for qualified IT, ICT, ICT security and cybersecurity practitioners.
International approaches of countries such as Singapore, UAE, Malaysia, Tunisia, UK, Finland,
and the U.S. show that a centrally-managed Information Security is the best approach to deal with
the threats and vulnerabilities of today's distributed and boundless networks, because a ministryby-ministry approach no longer provides effective security. A major obstacle to the government
recruitment of skilled IT and ICT security persons is a compensation scale reported to be less of
the private sector.
There is no evidence of strong information security for the Kingdom's infrastructure elements that
depend upon SCADA [1] based control systems, implying they could be highly vulnerable and
represent a major risk to the Kingdom’s critical ICT infrastructure.
Limited emphasis on the importance of the translation of business/mission requirements to an ICT
architecture, or the implementation of specified resilience requirements [2], was identified.
Improved planning guidelines for Facilities Based Providers were identified; however, no
equivalent guidelines for disaster recovery planning for ministry ICT and information systems
were identified.

[1] SCADA systems security are usually considered under Critical Information Protection activities however,

information security activities such as cryptographic key management and security patch installation fall under the
NISS scope.
[2] Resilience is usually considered under Critical Information Protection activities; however, it was an objective in
MCIT's NISS RFP and an important factor in creating confidence in the general public regarding the availability and
reliability of the growing number of the Kingdom's e-government services.

NISS GENERAL OBJECTIVES

The set of NISS General Objectives are the guideposts for the Kingdom’s on-going and future
information security efforts. They were established to enable the Kingdom's information security
foundation and posture to improve in a coordinated and effective manner and support national ICT
goals and objectives.
The NISS General Objectives provide the national level scope necessary to cover the security
requirements of the Kingdom's interconnected ICT infrastructure. This borderless infrastructure
enables remote attacks and penetrations that can seek the weakest entry point from anywhere in the
world.
The NISS is structured so the NISS General Objectives should be achieved by implementation of the
set of NISS Elements. Each NISS Element has its own set of detailed objectives that should be
achieved by applying a set of supporting Implementation Initiatives. Therefore, the NISS General
Objectives would be achieved upon implementation of the Initiatives of the NISS Elements. The
proposed five-year summary plan of the implementation sequence is in section 5.1
Recommendations, Figure 5.1-2.

Process and Principles for Generating the NISS General Objectives
The NISS General Objectives were generated using the various objectives in the Kingdom's national
plans related to information and information security, as well as MCIT's objectives for the NISS. The
objectives of each NISS Element were independently established and reviewed. The NISS General
Objectives and the NISS Element Objectives were then modified to ensure both sets were compatible.
A detailed flow chart of this process is included in the NISS Supplement. References to the
Kingdom's top ARE and ICT objectives used in this process are identified in the box below.
Long Term Strategy 2024 [1]
Vision “By the will of Allah, the Saudi economy in 2024 will be a more diversified, prosperous, private-sector
driven economy, providing Rewarding job opportunities, quality education, excellent health care and necessary
skills to ensure the well-being of all citizens while safeguarding Islamic values and the Kingdom’s cultural
heritage.”
National Science Technology and Innovation Plan (1426)

National Information Security Strategy

NISS General Objectives
The ten (10) NISS General Objectives are like the needle on a compass. They should help guide the
Kingdom in its on-going IS efforts to develop and maintain the comprehensive foundation required to
meet its long-term information and ICT goals. The NISS General Objectives were established to
enable the Kingdom's IS foundation and posture to improve in a coordinated and effective manner,
while also supporting national ICT goals and objectives. The NISS General Objectives were
generated using the NISS objectives set by the MCIT, as well as various objectives in the Kingdom's
national plans that are related to information and information security.
The NISS General Objectives are listed in the table in Figure 3.0-1 below. The table is followed by a
summary description of each objective.
NISS General Objectives
O-1 ‒ Effective and Secure Information Security Environment
Work towards assuring that appropriate and consistent information security policies, directives, guidance,
practices and oversight are achieved within the Kingdom.
O-2 ‒ Information Systems and ICT Infrastructure Enhancement
Enhance the security, reliability, availability and resilience of the Kingdom’s ICT infrastructure and
information systems.
O-3 ‒ Human Resource
Improve the IS human resource and expand the capability of Saudi information security practitioners,
researchers, innovators and entrepreneurs, both men and women; and establish special programs for training
and awareness especially directed towards youth of all ages and gender.
O-4 ‒ IS Threat Analysis and Mitigation
Establish an IS function and analysis capability to collect and analyze vulnerabilities, all-source threats and
risks to the Kingdom's ICT resources.
O-5 ‒ Reduction of On-going ICT Exploitation
Reduce and prevent exploitation of weak points in the Kingdom's information security (IS) by employing the
best international mitigation practices in local and national areas of highest IS risk.
O-6 ‒ IS Compliance and Tracking Processes
Maximize progress toward national improvement benchmarks and goals by implementing a comprehensive
compliance and tracking process, which ensures compliance with IS policies and standards and measures the
progress and status of the Kingdom's information security initiatives.
O-7 ‒ Research, Innovation and Entrepreneurship
Meet future IS needs by stimulating and directing the Kingdom's IS research and innovation programs that
have high potential for commercialization and IS breakthroughs, including cryptographic interoperability,
supply chain integrity, computer security and rapid and effective access control.
O-8 ‒ Maintenance of Information Security
Ensure adequate IS protection for the Kingdom by maintaining a continuous process that supports the IS
defensive posture for essential ICT infrastructures and information systems, and addresses new IS threats and
vulnerabilities.
O-9 ‒ National and International Cooperation
Achieve greater security for the Kingdom's information and ICT infrastructures by implementing new
domestic ICT security coordination and information sharing processes among stakeholders and by leveraging
international collaboration efforts.
O-10 ‒ Information Security Awareness and Responsibilities
Increase in all people their awareness of IS threats and vulnerabilities, as well as their understanding of
personal responsibilities to improve information security in their work environments and daily lives.
Figure 3.0-1 NISS General Objectives
The NISS General Objectives were established to support national ICT goals and objectives.

12 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

O-1 ‒ Effective and Secure Information Security Environment
This objective is based upon the need to develop a national information security environment that
forms the foundation, and sets the direction, of IS activities. It is accomplished through the
operational compliance of a national risk assessment framework, policy coordination, communication,
monitoring and all of the factors and functions necessary to efficiently achieve and maintain an
effective IS posture for all Kingdom's sector.
O-2 ‒ Information Systems and ICT Infrastructure Enhancement
This objective envisions an evolutionary process that ensures the technology, scalable architecture and
operational practices implemented are appropriate and align with the Kingdom's business/mission
objectives and the requirements of the infrastructure. It will provide appropriate assurance of effective
and secure disaster recovery and resilience. This includes confidence that critical e-government and
business functions can continue secure operation under degradation of assets, and that the information
and processing systems will recover quickly to an appropriately secure steady state.
O-3 ‒ Human Resource
This is a key pillar of the NISS. It represents a broad set of individual objectives involving theoretical
and practical IS education and training, as well as on-the-job experience with substantive evaluation
of each individual's true skills and capability for growth. It has components for practitioners,
managers, researchers and entrepreneurs. Special programs identify work-ready women who are
capable in IT and IS and who, with focused training, can meet some of the Kingdom's immediate IS
needs.
In addition, ethical unemployed youth, who have no formal credentials but have strong computer
skills and hacking capabilities, can be vetted and employed – first in controlled situations, while they
prove themselves.
Finally, a comprehensive program beginning in primary school identifies and encourages bright and
interested children to acquire computer, analytic and IS skills. These individuals would be mentored
and observed throughout their schooling and into initial employment.
O-4 ‒ IS Threat Analysis and Mitigation
The Kingdom needs to address IS threats and exploitation attempts at the national level. This
objective establishes such a capability via a national Security Operations Center (SOC), which would
collect and disseminate threat and intelligence information, analyze attacks, recommend mitigation
actions and coordinate a national response. The SOC would work with existing centers and
capabilities to facilitate national information sharing and coordinate mitigation and incident response
actions. An important element in the analysis process is the National Risk Assessment Function
(NRAF). This function will establish and help implement a national Risk Process Management
System that provides a common risk framework for the Kingdom.
O-5 ‒ Reduction of On-going ICT Exploitation
The NISS establishes the SOC as a resource to assist decision makers in understanding the impacts of
ICT exploitation and deciding how best to address and reduce IS risks. After an analysis of IS allsource threat and vulnerability data is provided to them via the SOC, decision makers will also be
supplied with the NRAF's risk analyses and can adopt the best of international mitigation practices
when faced with either a specific incident or a basic IS status review.
O-6 ‒ IS Compliance and Tracking Processes
An effective and secure Information Security Environment requires a measurement and compliance
capability to ensure progress and to identify challenges during implementation of the Kingdom's
focused and coordinated IS programs. A continuous compliance process guides and enforces
standards, baselines and best practices. It also ensures a uniform application of security policy across
a diverse set of both governmental and critical infrastructure organizations. The project measurement
and tracking component highlights the progress, or lack thereof, of the various NISS implementation
initiatives.

13 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

O-7 ‒ Research, Innovation and Entrepreneurship
This objective supports the identification and coordination of the Kingdom's future IS needs. It
contains increased education and training in patenting and innovation for researchers, as well as the
important areas of guiding young researchers to bridge the gap to commercialization and mentoring
beginning entrepreneurs.
O-8 ‒ Maintenance of Information Security
Information security is never an end state. It is always a continuous process because of constantly
evolving threats.
Effective ICT resilience and business continuity result primarily from
implementation of an appropriate architecture. Achieving an adequate state of IS and maintaining that
state with ever-changing technology and network configurations is a different challenge. In addition,
these changes create new vulnerabilities, while adversaries work to invent new attacks. Addressing
both situations demands agile and continuous attention by IS professionals.
O-9 ‒ National and International Cooperation
Many nations have faced IS challenges similar to those the Kingdom is facing today. Several
international forums provide useful IS cooperation and information sharing opportunities to address
these challenges. Within the Kingdom, as in other countries, information sharing can be a major
obstacle, as organizations jealously guard their territory and have limited dialogue with their
neighbors. The interconnectivity of today's networked ICT environment, unlike standalone
mainframes of the past, causes one organization's IS to be dependent upon the actions and security of
others. The equation is simple. As the in-country cooperation, collaboration and information sharing
increases, the risk of information loss and ICT systems exploitation decreases.
O-10 ‒ Information Security Awareness and Responsibilities
All subjects, in every position in the Kingdom, need to be appropriately aware of the IS threats,
vulnerabilities and risks that can affect their personal lives, as well as negatively impact business and
government operations. Today's networks have no boundaries, so worldwide interconnectivity and
social networks can be used to cause serious damage. Public awareness of the risks, the threat
indicators (and what to do about them) and the basic IS responsibilities of each individual can result in
a much stronger defense.

4.1 INFORMATION SECURITY ENVIRONMENT
The NISS information security environment element is a national configuration of information
security authorities and functional responsibilities that cover the entire scope of IS and information
assurance activities.
The entire Kingdom's (and, in fact, any nation's) Information Communications Technology (ICT)
infrastructure is interconnected. This can create exponentially increasing risks of successful attacks
and damage, as more of the Kingdom's important functions migrate to e-government. For example,
the expanding skills demonstrated in all types of IS exploitation create an increasing number of
vulnerabilities to the vital sectors of petroleum, communications, electricity and water, whose control
is via networks.
No matter how IS measures are employed within a single government agency, an effective defense
today depends upon the coordinated actions and defenses of other entities connected via networks.
This is the reason for establishing national IS structure policy, standards and guidelines. In addition,
each organization must implement its own appropriate procedures and initiatives, which will be
coordinated at the national level through National Information Security Environment Functions.
Detailed objectives, approaches and initiatives for this element are described below.

4.1.1

ELEMENT DESCRIPTION

The proposed information security function is best achieved through a secure and effective National
Information Security Environment (NISE). The NISE has an information security functions whose
responsibilities cover all areas of IS. These functions are illustrated below in Figure 4.1-1 NISE and
Functions. The NISE also has an administrative function and a support function for the various NISE
Functions. These Functions are composed of members from different government agencies. They can
also include appropriate representation from the private sector. It is in the Functions where the
coordination and cooperation are developed, which are necessary for effective execution of the
Kingdom's IS programs, projects and actions.
The NISE line organizations provide centralized technical functions of expertise and focus for the
various IS functions and capabilities. Existing activities and functions could be incorporated or
closely allied with the new functions to prevent duplication of effort. Examples of new activities and
functions include cryptographic design and evaluation, key management, IS risk assessments, threat

18 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

and vulnerability collection and analysis. Functions such as IS awareness and outreach should be
coordinated with and supportive of ongoing efforts.
The current system of IS management must evolve into a national system where IS is the
responsibility of everyone and all organizational elements, not just the IT components. Such evolution
will allow the Kingdom's vital ICT areas to be managed in a collective and comprehensive manner for
the benefit of all.

4.1.2

RELATIONSHIP TO KINGDOM'S TOP ICT OBJECTIVES

The following two relevant objectives are identified in the KSA Ninth Development Plan in Chapter
24, Information and Communication Technology[1]:



Providing ICT services infrastructure of high quality, security, and reliability, at reasonable
prices, in all regions and to all segments of society
Ensuring and safeguarding security of information of ICT services users

The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT)'s objectives [2] for this NISS
Element include the following:






Transform the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia into an information-secure society, enabling information
to be used and shared freely and securely.
Increase the security, safety, and integrity of online information while promoting the increased
use of information Technology.
Develop resilience in information systems.
Increase awareness and education of security risks and responsibility of information protection.
Create a set of national guidelines on Information Security Management, Risk Management and
Business Continuity based on international standards and best practices.

The NISE should provide the centralized technical means of coordination and cooperation for the IS
activities to achieve the above objectives and provide an effective and secure foundation for the
Kingdom's evolution to a knowledge economy. The NISE will also prioritize, stimulate and track
implementation of the Kingdom's IS initiatives and, when necessary, recommend course corrections
or alternatives. Appropriate transparency is critical, as is cooperation, coordination and collaboration
among the Kingdom's IS stakeholders. The Kingdom's long-term ICT security objectives are
important components in achieving the vision of a knowledge economy. The NISE is the structural
foundation for achieving these ICT security objectives.

4.1.3

ELEMENT OBJECTIVES

4.1.3.1

Objective G-1: Work towards having a Secure and Effective National
Information Security Environment (NISE)

Work towards having a National Information Security Environment (NISE) by incorporating all IS
stakeholders in the Kingdom. Its national management structure will consist of the NISE functions. It
will be based upon the best international practices of nations such as Singapore, UAE, Malaysia,
Tunisia, UK, Finland, the U.S. and others. NISE shall be responsible for the detailed implementation
of the NISS objectives and initiatives.

4.1.3.1.1 Approach
The appropriate authority in the Kingdom shall decide which entities and sub-entities to establish.
The specific roles for existing government agencies concerned with information security need to be
determined. The approach taken in proposing the NISE Environment and Functions, illustrated in
figure 4.1-1 was to identify the functions to be performed and principles to be followed, but not to
attempt any assignment of these functions to existing, combined or new organizations.
4.1.3.1.2 Implementation Initiatives
1) Identify the Components of the NISE
The proposed detailed NISE is shown below in Figure 4.1-1 NISE and Functions. The diagram
represents the functional composition and structure of a national information security environment,
based on best international practices and includes all IS stakeholders in the Kingdom.

2) Obtain a Consensus from the Kingdom's Top Leadership
A consensus of the Kingdom's top leadership is vital to provide the support and agreement needed to
effectively implement this national level IS environment. The approach suggested is based in part on
the already approved elements in existing Cabinet Resolutions and include the following:



The assessments, initiatives and planning need to be coordinated across the Kingdom under a
common framework ("to achieve universality across the Kingdom")
An independent group that provides a consistent framework and independent approach ("to
achieve … an objectivity")

4.1.3.1.3 Challenges and Issues
1) Because neither a Kingdom-wide IS environment nor a national set of security policies and
standards has ever been identified, each ministry has developed and operates their own security
systems as they see fit. It will be a major challenge to have each government agencies agree to
create the National Information Security Environment(NISE).
The standardization and support a national environment provides will benefit both the Kingdom
and each ministry, since operating in isolation no longer provides the security required. A
centralized national information security environment will provide much greater support and
assistance to those organizations that need it the most.

22 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

4.1.3.1.4 Measures of Progress
1) To plan and monitor the progress of each NISE related project and program, government agencies
can use the appropriate elements of ISO 27001 and 27002 as management guidelines, along with
a NISE management information system.

4.1.3.2

Objective G-2: Establish a National IS Policy and Directive Issuance
System

Establish a policy and requirements structure for the issuance of top-level IS national directives.
4.1.3.2.1 Approach
Ensure that the charter of the NISE contains adequate authority for the issuance of national directives,
instructions, manuals and any other items required to implement IS.
4.1.3.2.2 Implementation Initiative
1) Develop Requirements and Guidance
The NISE should develop the following types of requirements and guidance:





NISE Directives (NISEDs) are "big picture" issuances to establish NISE policy, assign
responsibilities and delegate authority to NISE components. NISEDs do not contain procedures.
NISE Instructions (NISEIs) are usually signed by an NISE division or function head to establish
or implement policy.
NISE Manuals (NISEMs) implement or supplement policy established in a Directive or
Instruction and usually focus on procedures or best practices for managing activities or systems.
Administrative Instructions provide guidance on administrative matters related to implementing
policy established in NISEDs or NISEIs that focus on administration of the NISE throughout a
particular government agency.

4.1.3.2.3 Challenges and Issues
1) Implementing this new national environment system will take training and a knowledgeable staff
to draft issuances and could require extensive coordination for implementation approvals.
4.1.3.2.4 Measures of Progress
1) A plan with milestones for drafting, approval and final issuance will be established and tracked as
a key performance measure for the efforts of the NISE.

4.1.3.3

Objective G-3: Establish NISE IS Compliance Function

Ensure that the NISE has the ability to monitor and enforce compliance with national policies,
directives and standards.
4.1.3.3.1 Approach
Incorporate this objective into the NISE charter.
4.1.3.3.2 Implementation Initiative
1) NISE Charter Approval
Have the NISE charter formally approved and officially established with responsibilities and
deadlines.
4.1.3.3.3 Challenges and Issues
1) Utilize outside organizations to assist and monitor assessments, as well as progress on IS
initiatives.
2) If status and assessments are restricted to the senior group and viewed as necessary for the
Kingdom's future welfare, addressing and mitigating the areas of highest risk will be the most
23 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

effective strategy for both the Kingdom as a whole and each individual Government entity, since
they are all linked.
3) Lack of progress is often due to lack of resources and not the will or capability of management to
proceed faster. Such deficiencies should be identified and appropriate resource adjustments made.
4.1.3.3.4 Measures of Progress
1) Providing the NISE with accurate and timely information on the status of each organization's
implementation initiatives, as well as the annual status of their IS posture, is important. If this is
done in a transparent manner and is restricted to those within the national structure with a need to
know, then areas of highest risk can be identified and prioritized for appropriate mitigation actions
and initiatives.

4.1.3.4

Objective G-4: Establish and Expand Programs for Development of the
IS Human Resource (HR)

Oversee, support and recommend programs for the development of the required set of IS and
cybersecurity people to meet the Kingdom's short and long-term human resource (HR) needs.
4.1.3.4.1 Approach
Utilize both international and Kingdom experts to identify national IS needs and qualifications and
initiate a program with education, training, certification and practical experience to meet the needs. At
the top university level, a Kingdom IS certification program can be established with uniform and
stringent certification standards for both teachers and curricula. This can be combined with foreign
universities. Exchange and internship programs with national companies and friendly foreign
companies and governments can be instituted. Establish a process of tracking the quality and skill
level of the people entering and graduating, along with an evaluation of their operational capabilities,
as opposed to paper credentials. This involves several ministries, including the Ministry of
Communications and Information Technology (MCIT), National Security Council (NSC), Ministry of
Higher education (MOHE), Ministry of Education (MOE), Ministry of Labor (MOL), Ministry of
Interior (MOI), Ministry of Civil Service (MCS) and Ministry of Defense (MOD). The number of
ministries required is the reason an oversight and advisory group is required at the national level.
4.1.3.4.2 Implementation Initiative
1) Establish and Formalize HR Requirements and the Measurements and Tracking System
Establish the IS HR requirements and the measurement and tracking system within NISE and make
them available for all government agencies.
4.1.3.4.3 Challenges and Issues
1) The challenge of identifying the true state of capability of the HR has always existed and is
important to address. Support and mentoring should be provided to people who lack the required
training and skills, yet have the desire to succeed and advance in the field of IS. Experienced and
qualified people should be enlisted to assist in this role.
4.1.3.4.4 Measures of Progress
1) The number of qualified IS professionals in place, along with what should be a growing number
and percentage of Saudis in these positions, is the key performance indicator.

4.1.3.5

Objective G-5: Establish NISE Outreach and Awareness Function and
All Remaining Functions

Provide expanded IS awareness, guidance, coordination and technical assistance to various entities of
the Kingdom, including appropriate elements of the private sector.

24 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

4.1.3.5.1 Approach
Require the NISE to be the lead organization responsible for this effort. Leverage this function by
coordinating, collaborating with and enlisting other people or organizations within and outside the
Kingdom. Coordinate and expand the ongoing outreach and educational and awareness efforts ‒ for
example. MCIT's Caravans, and CERT-SA. In addition, the ongoing efforts within each government
agencies should be encouraged, supported and coordinated with the efforts of other entities to create
and maintain synergy.
4.1.3.5.2 Implementation Initiative
1) Establish NISE Functions
Establish each of the NISE functions. For example, establish the National Outreach and Awareness
function within the NISE. This function should have both direct responsibility and the ability to
coordinate, collaborate and enlist other organizations in the Kingdom. Their charter covers the IS in
all sectors.
4.1.3.5.3 Challenges and Issues
1) Establishing the NISE will require a set of high-level and skilled IS practitioners. During the
initial implementation phases, HR may need to be augmented with international consultants and
non-Saudi practitioners.
4.1.3.5.4 Measures of Progress
1) The number of people involved in national IS outreach and support
2) The number of people reached by the individuals in measure #1 above

4.2 POLICY AND REGULATION
The Policy and Regulation strategy element will help the MCIT develop and set the framework for
meeting the objectives of the National Communications and Information Technology Plan. This
framework will define goals for national standards that reflect International Standards Organization
(ISO), Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) and industry best practices.
Policy development, regulation and compliance are vital aspects of any National Information
Technology framework. The development, issuance and maintenance of regulatory requirements by
the government help to ensure that standards are met which, in turn, support the safety, productivity
and economic development of the country.
The Anti-Cyber Crime Law (8 Rabi1, 1428 / 26 March 2007) provides a good base for prosecuting
those that attack, steal or damage a network or computer. However, this law does not cover
prevention, education and collaboration. The Electronic Transactions Law provides a good basis for
controlling, regulating and providing a legal framework for electronic transactions and signatures, but
is not as comprehensive as a full strategy. These laws were reviewed, along with the Telecom Act
(1422 / 03 June 2001) as the foundation for the NISS.
NISS development approach included the review and gap analysis of existing policies and regulations.
We mapped any gaps that were noted to ISO, ITIL and other industry best practices and developed
our element objectives and recommendations based on that mapping. The table in Figure 4.2-1 below
lists at a national level selected regulations, policies, standards and procedures that are required by an
organization to comply with International Standards Organization (ISO) 27001, 27002. The ISO
series of security standards provides a model for establishing, implementing, operating, monitoring,
reviewing, maintaining and improving an Information Security Management System. The following
high-level gap analysis is based, in part, upon a review of KSA laws, regulations, policies and
procedures provided to the NISS team. It can be useful in developing a framework for defining the
goals of a KSA national standard that adheres to International Standards Organization (ISO) 27001,
27002; Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL); and industry best practices.

Figure 4.2-1 High-level Gap Analysis of National Level Policies, Laws and Regulations
A gap analysis can be useful in developing a framework for defining the goals of a KSA
national IS standard that adhere to international standards and best practices.

4.2.1

ELEMENT DESCRIPTION

Well-written policies and procedures allow individuals and employees, as well as agencies and other
organizations within the Kingdom, to understand their roles and responsibilities within predefined
limits. Essentially, policies and procedures allow management to guide operations without constant
management intervention.
Government development and issuance of regulatory requirements help to ensure that standards are
met, which leads to greater safety, productivity and economic development. Information systems and
networks, as well as the information they contain, are essential assets of a nation and must be
appropriately protected and regulated.
A framework for such regulation includes policies, procedures and the ability to assess regulatory
compliance. The critical components of policy and regulation framework are outlined below as part of
the strategic roadmap for the KSA Policy and Regulation initiatives.

4.2.2

RELATIONSHIP TO KINGDOM'S TOP ICT OBJECTIVES

The Kingdom has identified several initiatives that address the need to combat cybersecurity crime,
establish enhancements and promote awareness. While the establishment of policy and regulation
governance will provide the Kingdom with the ability to assess regulatory compliance, it is also
crucial to the success of all strategies implemented.

4.2.3

ELEMENT OBJECTIVES

4.2.3.1

Objective P-1: National Policy Framework

Ensure that the owners and operators of KSA’s infrastructures have designed and implemented, as
well as manage and operate, ICT infrastructures with appropriate information security and resilience
practices for their systems and operations.

29 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

4.2.3.1.1 Approach
Ensure that all Kingdom policies and regulations are tailored to suit the unique organizational and
operating circumstances found within the national environment and at the ministerial level.
4.2.3.1.2 Implementation Initiative
1) Define and Design a National Policy Framework
Establish a Policy Development Function under the NISE with cooperation from all Kingdom IS
stakeholders.
Having a framework provides the foundation to allow all subsequent policy writing tasks to be more
efficient and focused.
4.2.3.1.3 Challenges and Issues
Because of the sensitive nature of information within each ministry, development of a trusting
environment to share specific information about vulnerabilities, incidents and practices will require
strong collaboration. The following issues must be addressed with that spirit of cooperation:
1) Establishment and definition of the ways in which ministries intend to express information
security policies
2) Identification of the audiences to whom policies will be addressed
3) Definition of the style and format in which policies will be written, the system for numbering and
naming policies and the linkages between policies and other management directives, such as
procedures and standards
4.2.3.1.4 Measures of Progress
1) Identification of policy risks
2) Evaluation of policy risk potential
3) Selection of the best policy risk management techniques to mitigate or manage risks without
unduly curtailing or modifying activities necessary to overall national security objectives
4) Monitoring, measuring and evaluation of the results

4.2.3.2

Objective P-2: Policy Maintenance

Ensure appropriate coverage of information security by current regulatory elements, as well as the
capability to cover requirements for future technological developments, by establishing a process for
overall review and possible modification, augmentation or creation of the Kingdom’s laws,
regulations and acts.
4.2.3.2.1 Approach
Develop a dynamic policy and risk management process that provides the capability to effectively
manage information system related security risks in a diverse environment of complex and
sophisticated cyber threats and increasing system vulnerabilities. Policy risk management includes the
evaluation and/or establishment of all regulations and practices designed to mitigate or eliminate
losses to which the Kingdom may be exposed. This function will work closely with the National Risk
Assessment Function, which is a under the NISE. The NRAS will communicate the types and origins
of risks identified in assessments and communicate them to Policy Development to determine if
modifications to policies or regulations should be proposed.
4.2.3.2.2 Implementation Initiatives
1) Information Policy Development Process
Define and design an Information Policy Development Process. Guidance on this complex process is
essential to ensuring a comprehensive and consistent policy program. This process includes:

30 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy






Writing and editing policies, obtaining management approval, communicating policies, and
implementing controls to meet policy requirements
Management instructions indicating a predetermined course of action, or a way to handle a
problem or situation
High-level statements that provide guidance to workers who must make present and future
decisions
Generalized requirements that must be written down and communicated to certain groups of
people inside and, in some cases, outside the organization

2) Policy Reviews
Establish a Function to conduct reviews of policies.
4.2.3.2.3 Challenges and Issues
1) Coordinating with various groups from across the Kingdom to ensure an all-encompassing
approach may present a challenge.
2) The Function must be granted the authority to complete the established objectives.
4.2.3.2.4 Measures of Progress
1) Establishment of a Policy Development Function
2) Increased level of policies being issued
3) Increased level of policies being updated

4.2.3.3

Objective P-3: Gap Analysis

Ensure all regulations and laws have accompanying policies, and vice versa, by establishing a policy
gap analysis process.
4.2.3.3.1 Approach
Selected laws and regulations are being analyzed for gaps and deficiencies, regarding handling and
use of digital information and the systems that transport, process, allow access to and store it. The
NISS will establish capabilities to conduct gap analyses, utilizing risk assessments and Business
Impact Analysis (BIA) to correlate specific system components with the critical services they provide.
Based on that information, the consequences of a particular policy, standard or procedure to the
correlated system components will be characterized.
1) Policy Development Team
The Policy Development Function should conduct a policy gap analysis comparing existing and
internally published policies with the ISO 27001, 27002, ITIL and Control Objectives for Information
and Related Technology (COBIT), as well as any other standard deemed necessary. They should
assist the various government agencies and other Kingdom organizations in this effort.
2) Security Policy Review
Review all currently available Kingdom security policies, including the following activities:



Identify the regulatory considerations, i.e. ISO, Certification and Accreditation (C&A), PCI or
others.
Produce a gap analysis.

3) Regulation Review
Review the main Kingdom framework of information regulations and laws, including the following
activities:


Identify the legal and regulatory considerations, e.g. ISO, Certification and Accreditation (C&A),
PCI and the physical location of the laws and regulations or others.

31 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy



Produce a gap analysis of the legal and regulatory areas as they pertain to Information Security.

Recommend the appropriate changes to update protection requirements and penalties in current laws
and regulations dealing with the use, handling, collection, release and storage of digital electronic
information. These updates are vital in today's cyber and networked world, with the high mobility of
data and ease of theft or loss.
4.2.3.3.2 Challenges and Issues
1) Emerging threats against the Kingdom’s critical infrastructures and key resources will expand
gaps against intended security objectives, as well as the policies and laws put into place to close
those gaps.
2) Constant monitoring of new threats against in-place and emerging policy issues is essential to
maintaining a secure environment. Coordinating with various groups from across the Kingdom to
ensure a unified approach may present a challenge.
4.2.3.3.3 Measures of Progress
1) Delivery of a policy gap analysis
2) Establishment of a policy repository containing policy objectives, as well as the data for the
policies implemented to solve those objectives

32 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

4.3 RISK MANAGEMENT AND ASSESSMENT
Risk Management and Assessment (RMA) is a dynamic, iterative and harmonized set of processes for
managing and assessing risk. These particular processes, and their implementation structure, compose
the Risk Process Management System (RPMS) and a national risk framework.
A national framework is needed for dealing with the Kingdom's Information Security (IS) risk
because today identical information can be stored and processed in multiple places, and the various
ICT systems and infrastructure are networked. Without a consistent risk assessment process across
the Kingdom's various elements, what one organization may evaluate as a high risk, another may
identify as low risk because each used different criteria. The problem for senior management is
obvious when they must evaluate and make high-level risk mitigating decisions on issues that cross
traditional ministry or organization boundaries. A common risk assessment framework is needed to
enable senior management to make informed decisions involving risk in the context of current and
future priorities, finite resources and global complexity.
The approach is to establish a national IS Risk Assessment Function (NRAF) within the National
Information Security Environment (NISE). It will be staffed with trained persons who will develop
and adapt the Risk Process Management System (RPMS) for the Kingdom, based on international
standards such as ISO 31000 and NIST SP 800-37. It should be noted that no publication covers all
situations and that the judgment of trained risk assessment persons is also required to produce the
most accurate and relevant assessments.
The RPMS is designed to ensure a secure National Integrated Information Infrastructure (N3i). This
term is defined as the broad set of components required to operate an enterprise ICT system. It
includes the information systems, such as hardware, software and communications interfaces; support
entities, such as power, cooling, facilities and disaster recovery sites; operating policies, performance
standards and procedures; and the people with the required skills to operate, maintain and meet the
service requirements. The term N3i can also be applied to infrastructures at different levels. At the
top level, it can mean the entire Kingdom’s ICT system. It could refer to that of a particular ministry
or a national component such as the Government Secure Bus. The fundamental concept is that the
term encompasses everything needed by, and associated with, a particular ICT infrastructure.
The RPMS is the management system that is adaptable to the culture, environment, objectives,
security needs, processes, size and structure of government agencies and the private sector. It provides
a consistent framework for the requisite tools, processes, policies, procedures and resources, including
IS risk assessments for the various N3is of the Kingdom.
Detailed objectives, approaches and initiatives for this element are described below.

4.3.1

ELEMENT DESCRIPTION

Risk is the uncertainty of loss, damage, theft or compromise of critical assets of any form. RMA is the
set of processes that enable the identification and analysis of critical information and ICT assets and
consider their vulnerabilities and the current and potential threats facing them. It can be used to
determine the degree to which an entity is organized to deal with risk. RMA also provides a
framework for sound decision making by senior management. The cycle of standard RMA activities is
illustrated below in Figure 4.3-1 Risk Assessment and Management Cycle.
The major elements of the national risk framework are the NRAF, the Risk Process Management
System (RPMS), an online e- National Risk Assessment Function (e-NRAF) and, when operational, a
comprehensive Risk Assessment Baseline of the Kingdom's Information, ICT assets, IS systems,
people and practices. The target of many risk assessments is often some element of the N3i, which
requires some of the staff to have strong ICT backgrounds.
The NRAF is the organization in the NISE that focuses on IS risk, risk assessment and risk
management.

33 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

RMA is the set of processes for managing and assessing IS risk.
The RPMS is the implementation of the RMA, including the combination of risk management
assessment procedures and the people and organizational structure responsible for applying them.
These individuals ensure that the RPMS is up to date and adequate for the assessment of the everevolving environment and current threats and vulnerabilities associated with the ICT and information
environment. The RPMS can also provide risk mitigation and incident guidance, and control
information to management. The RPMS will provide a framework that enables an organization to
establish risk governance and compliance, using a set of national policies, procedures and guidelines
adapted to its unique environment and resources.
The e-NRAF is an online repository of risk and risk mitigation information, references, training
material and program and project status. Items such as risk assessments have access restricted by
special security controls.
N3i is defined as the human resources, processes, practices, procedures, tools, facilities and
technology that deal with information and ICT infrastructure throughout their lifecycles, and that
involve national interests. The N3i designation can apply to a particular organization's systems, those
of an entire government agency or a private organization, including utilities – or at the top level, the
entire Kingdom.

4.3.3

ELEMENT OBJECTIVES

4.3.3.1

Objective K-1: Establish the National IS Risk Assessment Function
(NRAF)

Create and establish a National IS Risk Assessment Function (NRAF) under the National Information
Security Environment (NISE).
4.3.3.1.1 Approach
The approach is to educate and increase the awareness of the stakeholders and decision makers
regarding the vulnerabilities, threats and associated risks the Kingdom must deal with today, so that
they approve the implementation of the NRAF. The interconnectivity of information systems requires
threats and vulnerabilities to be assessed using a sufficiently broad risk-based approach to assess,
prioritize and manage IS activities.
4.3.3.1.2 Implementation Initiatives
1) Create and Establish the NRAF
Create and establish the NRAF, consisting of selected, risk-educated and trained senior-level KSA
executives. The NRAF will have the authority to oversee information security risk assessments of the
various N3i elements within the Kingdom.
2) Create and Formalize the NRAF Charter
Charter the NRAF to:




Serve as RMA advocates and a source of risk information to senior decision makers.
Design and implement collaborative information security risk workshops and seminars to
encourage the participation of N3i managers in implementation of national, regional and local risk
assessment activities.
Develop collaborative, cross-functional, resource sharing and inter-departmental interchanges
regarding IS risks.

National Information Security Strategy

3) Support National Education and Training Efforts
Support KSA national education and training efforts involving risk, risk assessment and risk
management.
4) Create an e-NRAF Function
Create an e-NRAS Function in the NRAF that will provide a comprehensive electronic information
security reference library, and will function as the central electronic reporting structure for risk that is
related to KSA N3i elements. The e-NRAF mandate is to promote outreach, awareness, education,
transparency and trust amongst KSA entities, and should include extensive risk references in Arabic.
4.3.3.1.3 Challenges and Issues
1) Encouraging N3i senior management to collaborate on NISS risk issues may be a challenge, as it
can expose organizational weaknesses. Specialized workshops should be designed to develop and
encourage open dialogue and establish mutual trust, which can serve as the vehicle to build a
cohesive non-fragmented national effort. This will require seasoned, experienced management
personnel to function as workshop designers and instructor-facilitators, preferably from the
NRAF.
2) Establishment of a web interface and extensive background database with a user-friendly search
capability (a search capability and query answer designed for non-ICT professionals)
4.3.3.1.4 Measures of Progress
1) Published, signed and implemented RMA Policy
2) Employment of project tracking and scheduling tools critical path, resource management tools
and KSA National Risk Process Management Performance Measurement tools, to track and
measure the progress of risk assessments throughout the Kingdom.

4.3.3.2

Objective K-2: Establish the National Risk Process Management
System (RPMS)

Develop and implement a national RPMS that establishes information security environment and
compliance through national policies, procedures and guidelines.
4.3.3.2.1 Approach
The approach here is identical to that for K-1. Convince the senior leadership of the importance of the
implementation of this objective, so they will approve the NRAF and this RPMS.
4.3.3.2.2 Implementation Initiatives
1) Develop and Implement RPMS
Develop and implement a national level RPMS that provides for the protection of KSA assets in any
form and against any threat, while recognizing that each of the asset forms are interrelated,
interconnected and inter-operative (at least with one another), and that an incident affecting one
affects at least one other, and most likely more.
2) Develop a Process Mapping Tool
Develop a process mapping tool (or acceptable facsimile) to review, evaluate and analyze the
processes and/or method(s) by which an entity operates, and determine where in that process or
processes management control points: (1) Exist or do not exist, (2) Are needed or may be required or
(3) Require enhancing, refining or eliminating.
3) Integrate Safety, Security, Risk Management, Insurance and Claims Functions
Integrate the Safety, Security, Risk Management, Insurance and Claims functions into the RMA to
ensure a more broadly based and risk-focused IS risk management approach.

36 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

4) Create Custom Policies and RPMS’ at the Operations Level
Require that each manager of a N3i element adopt the National Risk Policy and RPMS as the
foundation for creating their own custom RPMS and policy, along with procedures and guidelines.
5) Require Certified NRAF Assessment for Interconnecting Elements
Require those entities wanting to interconnect to a Kingdom N3i to supply a risk assessment certified
by the NRAF before connecting, as well as whatever other technical requirements might be placed
upon them.
6) Establish Policy and Document Revision Standards
Require all policies to be reviewed, signed and published at least annually, and when major changes
occur that are or should be formalized. Procedures and guidelines must be reviewed in accordance
with policy requirements and with change management, which is a required component of the RPMS.
7) Certify Basic RPMS Components of Operational Organizations
Certify that each organization's RPMS is based on the National RPMS and contains components with
performance standards that include continuous and iterative reviews of internal policies, procedures
and guidelines.
4.3.3.2.3 Challenges and Issues
1) Information Security Environment and compliance are the foundation for the RPMS and must be
established as integrated, interrelated management functions. Without such a foundation, the
Kingdom's Risk Management and Assessment Strategy would become merely a paper exercise
program leaving KSA's critical assets vulnerable.
4.3.3.2.4 Measures of Progress
1) Publish online, through the e-NRAF Function, all gap analyses, risk maturity model evaluations
and project plans, progress and schedules. This will enable tracking of the status of the NISS
implementation, and ongoing risk assessments of various N3i elements using the RPMS. In
addition, it will enable NRAF and N3i management to utilize the output of the risk assessments to
manage the risks that have been identified.

4.3.3.3

Objective K-3: Conduct IS Risk Assessments of Major ICT Systems for
a Kingdom Baseline

Conduct a macro IS risk assessment to establish a risk baseline for the Kingdom's major ICT systems.
4.3.3.3.1 Approach
Convince the key decision makers and stakeholders of the damage and very high risk of NOT
establishing a baseline of the risk that the various entities and elements are currently facing.
Ignorance of the current risks and not addressing them now carries a much greater risk of loss or
damage in the future.
For example, it is a certainty that the Kingdom's information assets are under continuous surveillance
and selected attack. This requires a dynamic and centralized organizational framework to assess the
associated risks and supply management with quality data for decision-making.
4.3.3.3.2 Implementation Initiative
1) Conduct Initial and Periodic Risk Assessments
Trained personnel will conduct an initial, and subsequently periodic, risk assessment to establish
baselines that: (i) Determine the degree to which KSA and its organizations are prepared and
organized to deal with Risks, (ii) Determine the adequacy of current RMA programs and if they meet
National Risk Process Management System criteria or current best practices and (iii) Enable senior
N3i management to determine the next best steps to be taken to manage identified risks.

37 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

2) NRAF Risk Management and Assessment Staff
Develop criteria for selecting the Risk Management and Assessment staff in the NRAF. They will be
educated and trained in Risk Management and Assessment and then certified as Senior Risk
Managers. They will serve as resources and coaches/mentors to N3i senior management and as the
foundation for future N3i educators, trainers and coaches/mentors. They will also certify trained N3i
risk management staff and others who meet the established criteria.
3) RMA-Trained Staff from Key Organizations
NRAF staff will help select, educate and train personnel from key organizations, including the
defense sector if they want this training. The selected personnel will be RMA trained and certified to
conduct risk assessments. It is preferable that the RMA certified personnel should not be the only ones
directing the risk analysis for the infrastructure with which they are or may be affiliated. The objective
is to ensure an accurate and impartial assessment that identifies existing weaknesses, strengths,
vulnerabilities and threats.
4) RPMS Measurement Tools
NRAF will analyze its risk assessment findings using RPMS measurement tools.
5) N3i Senior Risk Managers
RMA-certified personnel will serve as future N3i senior risk managers
6) National Information Security RMA Training Program
NRAF staff will design and manage the National Information Security RMA Training Program.
7) Continuing Education
NRAF will establish, through its NRAF senior risk managers, mandated initial and continuing RMA
Training Programs, which will certify graduates and require ongoing education, training for recertification.
8) Discuss Assessment Findings with Appropriate Personnel
Do NOT publish, but discuss with the NRAF and each N3i member’s senior management the Initial
Risk Assessment findings. Have the NRAF and the senior N3i management determine the next best
steps to resolve any negative findings and a strategy to do so, including timelines.
4.3.3.3.3 Challenges and Issues
The following challenges and issues are the same as those in K-1 and K-2.
1) Encouraging N3i senior management to collaborate on NISS risk issues may be a challenge, as it
can expose organizational weaknesses. Specialized workshops should be designed to develop and
encourage open dialogue and establish mutual trust, which can serve as the vehicle to build a
cohesive non-fragmented national effort. This will require seasoned, experienced management
personnel to function as workshop designers and instructor-facilitators, preferably from the
NRAS.
2) Information Security Environment and compliance are the foundation for the RPMS and must be
established as integrated, interrelated management functions. Without such a foundation, the
Kingdom's Risk Management and Assessment Strategy would become merely a paper exercise
program leaving KSA's critical assets vulnerable.
4.3.3.3.4 Measures of Progress
1) Create an RPMS tool to measure the effectiveness of an organizations current risk assessment
process and to determine if the RPMS is adequately implemented and integrated into and
throughout the organization and their processes.
2) The RPMS will address high frequency/severity/impact real or potential threats, including those
in transition from uncertain threats to certain definite threats. Definite threat means there is no
question a current threat exists such as from foreign attacks against the Kingdom's ICT systems.
38 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

What may be unknown is the severity and potential damage from the threat and the risk that it
creates. The number and scope of credible Risk Assessments is a good measure of progress.
3) Establish the e-NRAF website. Measure and analyze online usage and page hits.

4.4 NATIONAL ICT INFRASTRUCTURE
This section of the NISS identifies objectives and approaches to strengthen the information security
and resilience of the KSA ICT infrastructures, specifically with respect to required design,
implementation, management and operational functions and processes.
The National Information Communications and Technology (ICT) infrastructures and information
systems of the KSA must be protected and prepared to respond to internal and external events that
could adversely affect their overall security and availability, and affect the homeland and its people. A
review and analysis of available KSA information identified both a need to and a collective awareness
for greater consistent application of national-level information security requirements, guidelines and
processes similar to those implemented by mature information societies of other countries.
KSA initiatives already underway to augment and improve infrastructure security and resilience
efforts should be continued and are incorporated into the approaches described in this section. Several
essential technical approaches and initiatives are detailed in this section to achieve better and more
consistent results. They are to be implemented together with the policy directions, risk management,
governance, organizational and process development and implementation discussed in other sections
of the NISS.

4.4.1

ELEMENT DESCRIPTION

When developing strategic directions and initiatives for the information security of national ICT
infrastructures and information systems for the NISS, it is important to understand them in the context
and relationship to critical infrastructures within the KSA. Only the current e-Government initiatives
show evidence of the application of a consistent risk assessment methodology, an enterprise level
architecture and a business/mission requirements analysis to drive the application of information
security controls and practices commensurate with systems posing similar risks.
Within many societies today, ICT infrastructures and information systems provide critical functions
and services that affect the operations of a nation’s security systems, government organizations and
private enterprises. As operational dependency on the ICT and electronic systems increases, the
management of information security risks becomes more critical. Information security is not only an
essential enabling function for most services, but must also provide countermeasures to vulnerabilities
that can be exploited.
In addition, the implementation of ICT information systems, applications and operational processes
affects the availability, reliably and sustainably of critical functions and services in the face of
disruptive events. One of the overarching NISS goals is to
provide KSA a strategic direction, in order to achieve an
“Infrastructure resilience” is the
appropriate and sustained level of ICT security and
ability to reduce the magnitude and/or

resulting security and resilience performance that ICT
infrastructures and systems must achieve. The performance and effectiveness of the implementation
and operation of an ICT information system or infrastructure is determined by four key aspects ‒
people, process, culture and technology.
Management of the environment of national ICT infrastructures and information systems must be
consistent with an incident response and crisis management system that is applicable to a
business/mission environment. Figure 4.4-1 displays the integration of these activities in the context
of this section of the NISS.

40 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

Figure 4.4-1 Design, Implement, Operate and Manage
These efforts must be accomplished as parts of an integrated process.

The challenge for those addressing complex ICT infrastructures and information systems is assuring
there is a framework that aligns the business/mission objectives and requirements with the appropriate
technology architecture and operational practices. The internationally accepted definition of
architecture is “The fundamental organization of a system, embodied in its components, their
relationships to each other and the environment, and the principles governing its design and
evolution.”[1] For KSA e-Government initiatives, the YESSER Consulting Group has properly
identified the importance of this relationship and has established architectural assistance services to
guide the transition of ministries to e-Government services. Similar collaboration and information
sharing would be beneficial among critical infrastructure owners and operators. Similarly, government
and private sector organizations need to have a stronger partnership focus, sharing information and
practices in ICT and information systems architecture development and analysis.
Therefore, the NISS must assure that those with responsibility for advancing the KSA transformation
adopt a culture that values and adopts a strategy with a focus on enterprise architectures ‒ a culture
biased toward the adoption of open architectures and standards, and well-developed resilience
approaches based on risk mitigation requirements. National-level direction, principles, objectives and
requirements established through a NISE structure described in the NISS can advance and foster the
required culture.
Applying these principles requires an architectural framework. An architectural framework is a
structure for developing a range of architectures. The Open Group Architecture Framework (TOGAF)
is one such broadly accepted, internationally developed framework that is used for developing
enterprise architectures.
Leading industrialized countries have been addressing information security and ICT infrastructures
security and resilience for many years, along with the efforts of international standards bodies and
numerous institutes and organizations. The body of knowledge and lessons learned provide a rich
array of strategies, objectives and practices to address similar challenges faced by all organizations
within the Kingdom.

RELATIONSHIP TO KINGDOM'S TOP ICT OBJECTIVES

The KSA Ninth Development Plan (Eng.), Chapter 24, Information and Communication
Technology[2] identifies two important objectives most relevant to this section of the NISS:



ICT services infrastructure should provide high quality, security, and reliability, at reasonable
prices, in all regions and to all segments of society and
ICT infrastructures and services should ensure and provide safeguards for the security of user’s
information.

The NISS National ICT infrastructure objectives in this section are constructed to complement
existing efforts within the KSA and to further ensure several key strategic outcomes essential to
KSA’s transformation to an information society are achieved. The key ICT infrastructure outcomes to
be achieved are:





An internationally recognized Kingdom-wide technical strategy, culture and practices that further
strengthen security and resilience for ICT infrastructures and information systems that affect the
national security and economic security posture of KSA
Assurance and confidence in the security and resilience design and implementation of ICT and
information systems across the Kingdom
Accelerated adoption of appropriate internationally accepted security and resilience standards,
processes, controls and practices, such as ISO/IEC, ITIL, CoBIT and TOGAF; as well as the
evolution of improved security technology across the ICT and information system life cycle
Increased levels of trust by the Kingdom’s businesses, government organizations and people
using online services and applications for daily activities

4.4.3

ELEMENT OBJECTIVES

International standards bodies (e.g. ITU, and ISO/IEC) and other recognized leading IT and security
organizations (e.g. COBIT, ITIL, TOG, ISACA and the U.S. National Institute of Standards and
Technology (NIST)) have mature frameworks, best practices and standards developed by wellestablished national and international communities. These address essential processes for IT
Governance, Enterprise Architectures and Frameworks, IT Service Management, Information Security
Management Systems, Security Control Domains, Security Standards and Best Practice Guidance.
YESSER efforts for e-Government demonstrate the type of structured endeavor that is needed for ICT
systems to provide and achieve the coordination, guidance, business process focus, architectures and
standardization for more integrated information security capabilities, and to capitalize on the value
that modern ICT can provide.
Analysis of NISS data collection documents and responses to questions identified a range of
information security efforts for ICT and information systems environments that are at various stages
of maturity, among the responding ministries. Through a more consistent application of generally
accepted international best practices and adoption of more mature information security management
processes, information security efforts within ministries can be elevated. Key objectives for the
National ICT Infrastructure are identified in this section. Specific strategies for achieving these
objectives are also provided, along with a list of implementation initiatives to improve the information
security and resilience posture for participating organizations and critical ICT infrastructure
components.

National Information Security Strategy

4.4.3.1

Objective
T-1:
ICT
Infrastructure
Evolution,
Implementation, Management and Operations

Architecture,

Ensure that the owners and operators of KSA’s critical infrastructures evolve their ICT architecture
and implement, manage and operate ICT infrastructures with appropriate information security and
resilience practices for their systems and operations.
4.4.3.1.1 Approach
Create a national program to assure the physical protection and security of the information systems
within critical infrastructures. ICT infrastructures must be protected and designed to operate in the
face of failures and threats commensurate with their critical national and economic security
operational functions, dependencies and interdependencies. Capitalize on lessons learned from similar
efforts of other countries. Include within the program the adoption of the NISS, and require KSA
infrastructure organizations to develop an infrastructure dependency and interdependencies analysis.
To further support information security goals, structure both formal and informal capabilities and
processes that will foster and enhance information sharing and cross-organizational coordination
among infrastructure owners and operators.
4.4.3.1.2 Implementation Initiatives
1) Collaboration Between The Public Sector and Infrastructure Operators
Establish a combined effort of representatives from public sector organizations with mission
responsibilities for infrastructure and the owners/operators of those infrastructures. They will
undertake the development of a national program that results in consistent risk assessments,
application of internationally recognized best practices, security controls and countermeasures for
similar infrastructures. Such results can be shared through the appropriate NISE Functions, such as
the Security Operations Center (SOC), establishing broader information sharing and incident
response/management and coordination.
The national program should be designed to:





Ensure that the ICT and information systems that underlie critical national and organizational
infrastructures have implemented proactive protective and resilient technological strategies,
architectures, implementations and processes to meet critical levels of services. These strategies,
architectures, implementations and processes should be based on both dependency and
interdependency analyses and an operational risk assessment.
Leverage international standards, partnerships, alliances and collaboration through participation in
international security bodies and organizations to identify state-of-the-art practices and
technology.
Utilize CERT-SA and any other IS and cyber threat and incident centers and establish a Function
comprised of government and private sector technical representatives from critical infrastructure
areas. These representatives will establish responsibilities and processes for the expanded sharing
of operational situation awareness (incident, threats and vulnerability), coordinate security and
resilience practices, develop the necessary capabilities for cyber-incident analysis and creation of
secure processes for sharing information and situational awareness for operators and decision
makers. This could evolve into an all-source Security Operations Center under the NISE and
should support KSA national-level crisis management efforts.

2) Partnership with Telecommunications Providers
The Government’s Telecom Regulator shall ensure a long-term partnership effort is undertaken with
telecommunications providers to assess and improve telecommunications/network security and
resilience. This is a necessary effort to support the increased dependency and interdependency that
will result as the Kingdom transforms into an information society and digital economy. Consider
formation of a private sector National Security and Emergency Preparedness Telecommunications

43 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

Advisory Committee, comprised of senior members of key telecommunication and internet service
providers, to assist in the effort and progress reviews.
3) IS Business Continuity and Disaster Planning and Management
Due to the importance of electric power for the operation of most ICT and information systems,
conduct an analysis to assure that SCADA, and other systems required to maintain and recover
operations of vital electric power system components, have implemented required ICT and
information system asset protection and security measures. Ensure that such measures are regularly
monitored, evaluated and audited for effectiveness. Ensure business continuity plans and disaster
management and restoration plans are established and regularly exercised. It should be recognized that
to provide adequate IS business continuity many supporting areas must be addressed to assure
effective backup and restoration in the event of a disaster
4.4.3.1.3 Challenges and Issues
1) Though each critical infrastructure organization is responsible for its own operation’s security and
resilience, the national government must ensure that those organizations are implementing
practices commensurate with the importance of the services, as well as their potential to impact
KSA’s national and economic security.
2) Telecommunication dependencies affect all other critical infrastructures. Historical relationships
and independence must transform to an increased transparency that increases confidence and
assurances of service.
3) Because of the sensitive nature of information about these infrastructure operations, development
of a trusting environment to share specific information about vulnerabilities, incidents and
practices will require strong collaboration among owners and operators. Specific
recommendations for sharing this type of information are highlighted in National Cooperation
and Sharing for Information Security, section 4.7‫ن‬
4.4.3.1.4 Measures of Progress
1) The extent of the willingness of leaders to encourage collaborative efforts and methodically
measure progress and accountability on implementation initiatives is a key indicator leading to
success.
2) Service quality and outage metrics should be standardized and reviewed by MCIT with
infrastructure owners and operators to identify issues to be addressed.
3) Identify key service metrics, to include service restoration goals. Exercises and test of recovery
and restoration plans and processes should be conducted on a regular basis to identify after action
areas of improvement. Track and test after actions to assure proper implementation and changes in
processes.

4.4.3.2

Objective T-2: Technical Frameworks for ICT Infrastructures and
Information Systems

Establish a KSA common evaluation process that permits owners and operators of ICT infrastructures
and information systems to uniformly identify an appropriate risk tier level that reflects their ICT
infrastructure and system information security and resilience requirements.
4.4.3.2.1 Approach
As guidance to owners and operators of ICT and information systems, develop a set of common
technical frameworks for security and resilience approaches and practices, to be applied to systems
based on the risk assessment methodology discussed in section 4.3 Risk Management and
Assessment.

44 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

4.4.3.2.2 Implementation Initiatives
1) ICT Security Standards and Policies
Establish a well-publicized national program to lead, coordinate and establish initiatives among the
national security, ministries, critical infrastructure sectors and private sector organizations to assess
and improve the security and resilience of critical infrastructures utilizing a common risk framework.
2) Risk Tier Standards
Establish risk tier standards, controls and metrics for assuring consistent security and resilience
application by ICT and information system owners and operators by adapting the U.S. National
Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) 800 series process as the basis for developing such an
approach for KSA.
4.4.3.2.3 Challenges and Issues
1) Elevating the priority of the technical challenge and the importance of collaborative efforts to
KSA is essential, especially to attract the best technical talent to this difficult endeavor.
2) Due to the very complex nature of the ICT and information systems, KSA should capitalize on
existing developed frameworks, guidelines and standards; for example, the U.S. NIST approach
and documents. They can serve as a way of accelerating adoption of the required framework.
3) Inter-networking of information systems and networks requiring different levels of risk
management must be explicitly addressed, especially as cloud architectures are adopted.
4.4.3.2.4 Measures of Progress
1) Developing the KSA technical framework should be a priority effort. Specific milestones should
be established and tracked during development of the framework.
2) Metrics for the adoption levels by organizations can be carried out through annual surveys and
should be used as a key performance indicator of progress.
3) Continuous monitoring of critical sensitive interconnections can be applied to measure and
demonstrate compliance with requirements

4.4.3.3

Objective T-3: Government ICT Infrastructures

Institutionalize a cross-ministry effort that goes beyond e-Government systems to evaluate and assure
that each ministry has well-defined processes to address documented security and resilience
requirements for their ICT infrastructure and systems.
4.4.3.3.1 Approach
Provide an increased national focus on current implementations to identify any security and resilience
gaps. Develop remediation or technology migration plans to meet the transformational aspirations of
the KSA.
4.4.3.3.2 Implementation Initiatives
1) Cadre of Expertise
Develop a cadre of expertise familiar with current architectural analysis and development processes
and tools to enhance capabilities and promote the importance of these specific skills and expertise.
2) Workshops and Opportunities for Expanding Information Sharing and Collaboration
Create workshops and opportunities for expanding information sharing and collaboration among
government, private sector and academic organizations about enterprise architectures. Include a
special focus on wireless and cloud based services/infrastructures.

45 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

3) Government Enterprise Architecture (GEA)
Adopt, and require ministries to follow, a Government Enterprise Architecture (GEA) and identify
international security standards, practices and common technology configurations to be applied to the
GEA.
4) Compliance Monitoring Practices
Develop compliance monitoring practices using continuous monitoring methodologies for evaluating
the state of compliance to adopted standard configurations.
5) Engagements with International Activities
Increase the number and frequency of engagements with international activities such as The Open
Group, standards bodies and consortiums that are leaders in security and resilience for existing and
emerging technologies.
4.4.3.3.3 Challenges and Issues
1) Strong leadership among Chief Information Officers (CIOs) within ministries or agencies will be
required.
2) Developing a common vision and mission among the diverse ministries will take time, unless
there has been a prior focus on architecture methodologies. Similar broad efforts have taken years
to reach maturity.
3) Those that share a common network and do not comply with the architecture and practices can
place the security of others at great risk. Some have found that penetration testing by expert
companies in this field can be effective in demonstrating existing issues, which then precipitates
greater collaboration and a willingness to share information and practices.
4) Emerging use of more automated compliance monitoring capabilities has shown objective levels
of improvement. New techniques require sufficient resources and time for adoption.
5) Technology and security threats and capabilities change rapidly. Very active engagement with
those facing similar problems and issues is essential.
4.4.3.3.4 Measures of Progress
1) Tracking of the number of new certified individuals and experience levels with architectural
analysis tools and processes within each ministries CIO office
2) Establishment of a plan and timeline for development and transition to common architectures,
standard products and shared services and infrastructures
3) Tracking and publishing of milestone accomplishments
3) Compliance audits and testing of each ministry on a regular periodic basis, and providing them
with scorecards, can serve to monitor and demonstrate continuous improvements in these critical
areas.
4) Identification of organizational responsibilities for selected international engagements;
Levels of information sharing resulting from those engagements with colleagues in other
ministries

4.5 HUMAN RESOURCE
The Human Resource (HR) element of the NISS is focused on expanding the number of Saudis
qualified and willing to work for the government in the field of IS security. Five interrelated and
interconnected HR elements require integrated and overlapping approaches involving Human
Infrastructure (Human Resource in specific jobs), Education, Training, Awareness and Shared
Responsibility.
Increasingly rapid changes in technological, economic, cultural and occupational spheres have
radically increased the risks to information and ICT systems. Most of the Kingdom's organizations
that responded to the NISS data collection questionnaire cited lack of qualified ICT security staff as a
major issue. Without qualified staff, the appropriate defense cannot be implemented and ongoing
penetration attempts and successes may not even be noticed. This situation could place such elements
as the Kingdom's major financial and investment strategies, the petroleum delivery systems and the
nation's political deliberations at risk of exposure or exploitation due to weak IS practices.
The approach is to first identify work-ready Saudis who, with minimum of training, could be quickly
employed based on their true (not paper) qualifications. Second, it has been reported that government
compensation for Saudi employment in IT and IT security positions is neither competitive with
private industry nor equivalent to that received by some professionals from neighboring countries.
Instituting a premium compensation scale to raise Saudi compensation is proposed so the current
unfilled need can be met. The third approach is to greatly expand IS education and training. Detailed
objectives, approaches and initiatives for this element are described in the sub-sections below.

4.5.1

ELEMENT DESCRIPTION

The HR element of the NISS focuses on the broad range of information security and ICT security
requirements that involve the following five areas.
Human Infrastructure is defined as the human resources in individual positions of leadership,
employment or functional responsibility. For example, a brilliant researcher who is not a manager and
an excellent manager who is not a researcher compose a human resource. One assignment creating a
human infrastructure would be the researcher in a research position and the manager in a managerial
position. Another assignment could be the reverse with the researcher in the managerial position and
the manager in the research position. It is clear that the value to the Kingdom of the second human
infrastructure assignment is much less than the first.
Education is a broad concept involving the entire spectrum of both formal, self-taught, on line,
professional and job based schools, institutes, workshops, special courses, programs and opportunities
to equip human resources with the knowledge, learning capability, thinking , language, analytical and
problem solving skills needed for success in the 21st century's ICT and information environment. At
the top university level, a Kingdom IS certification program can be established with uniform and
stringent certification standards for both teachers and curriculum. This can be combined with foreign
universities in exchange of both teachers and students.
Training is intended to provide and continually update the mental and physical skills, language
proficiency and functional knowledge required for productive employment today and into the future.
This includes the development of technical capabilities and strategic thinking, as well as individuals
who can manage, supervise and make sound security decisions in the context of their organizations’
missions and available resources.
Awareness is the understanding of the threats and vulnerabilities in today's government, private
sector and consumer online systems and the consequences of poor security in each. Technology,
innovation and growth sectors require HR ICT security awareness. It is the responsibility of each
individual to protect information in any form, from its creation to its eventual destruction, regardless
of who owns the information. This is accomplished through initiatives and the use of creative
approaches to ensure that ICTS awareness, education and training are available to all people.
47 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

Shared Responsibility is the concept that each person has a responsibility to act appropriately in
protecting the information and ICT systems belonging to them and their organization, as well as each
ICT system with which they are involved. It is important for the leadership, government and private
sector managers and employees, as well as the public, to understand that the actions or lack of correct
actions, by even one person can create high risk to the security and privacy of information and the
security of ICT systems that are remote but interconnected.

4.5.2

RELATIONSHIP TO KINGDOM'S TOP ICT OBJECTIVES

The Kingdom's HR is a major element of each of the national plans, with emphasis depending upon
the objective of the plan. Some national objectives relevant to the HR Element of the NISS are listed
in the boxes below.

National Communications and Information Technology (NCIT) Plan [1]




…. It is expected that ICT will greatly facilitate the effective employment of women and
utilization of their capacities.
Raising the percentage of university students in ICT specializations Transformation to
information society requires the promotion and development of educational curricula, teaching
and learning methods, as well as dissemination of new constructive concepts and values in the
society that encourages innovation, invention, creativity, work perfection, productivity, raising
initiatives and acceptance of failure.

Ninth Development Plan
Human Resources Development[2]

The Plan highlights a range of issues and challenges facing the Kingdom in its drive towards
attaining higher international competitiveness rankings. These include:
 The need to raise the educational level of the workforce, towards a well-qualified workforce,
capable of absorbing new technologies, is one of the cornerstones of competitiveness.

4.5.3

ELEMENT OBJECTIVES

4.5.3.1

Objective H-1: Increase Number of Saudi IS Practitioners and Managers

Increase the availability and number of educated, trained and skilled Saudi Information
Communications and Technology Security (ICTS) professionals and managers to fill current and
future key ICTS positions.
4.5.3.1.1 Approach
The approach consists of a series of both short and long-term initiatives that utilize current
information security human resources and are aimed at increasing the size of the future ICT and ICTS
Saudi HR.
The short-term strategy is to:



Eliminate the current disincentives for skilled people to accept ICTS government jobs.
Increase the utilization of women in ICTS.

National Information Security Strategy







Recruit, train and employ work-ready but underutilized ICTS skilled Saudis in the Kingdom's
provinces.
Repatriate skilled Saudi teachers, researchers and practitioners currently overseas for both
temporary and permanent assignments in ICTS.
Revaluate the skills, qualifications and performance effectiveness of those in senior ICTS
positions for eligibility for premium compensation, as well as for being retained in that critical
position.
Review civil service’s job descriptions and HR regulations that pertain to ICTS positions.

The longer-term strategy is to:





Create a process for early identification of talented children and youth to be trained for key ICTS
positions in the Kingdom.
Create a national ICTS development program.
Create cooperative programs with friendly international countries and institutions.
Establish continuous and current professional training for ICTS teachers, researchers and
practitioners.

4.5.3.1.2 Implementation Initiatives
1) Upgrade Salary Scale
Develop a scale for ICTS government jobs that is comparable in wages and benefits with industry
compensation for qualified persons.
2) Employ qualified women
Employ qualified women in ICTS positions, some of which could be in all female locations. Identify
and establish a cadre of skilled Saudi female ICTS practitioners and teachers with appropriate training
and competitive salaries.
3) Hire Skilled Saudi ICTS Persons
Encourage the Kingdom's provinces to hire skilled Saudi ICTS persons so the regional and municipal
ICT systems and disaster recovery infrastructure meet information security objectives.
4) Establish Salary and Benefits Incentives
Establish an incentive program of salary and benefits to encourage Saudis qualified in ICTS who are
new graduates, or are currently working in the private sector, to accept government positions. It is
important to establish a compensation program for new graduates that provides mentoring, helps them
to understand the organization and job requirements and rewards them with a view of a positive career
path for successful performance. For the more experienced persons from industry, it is important that
their introduction into government service be positive. They should be informed of appropriate career
training and advancement opportunities, as they demonstrate their competence. In this case, a more
senior mentor or advisor can help to make the transition smoother and reduce the natural stress of a
major job change.
5) Identify and Train Talented Students
Have the Ministry of Education (MOE) and Ministry of Higher Education (MOHE) investigate and
establish a coordinated program to identify talented students and also provide practical training such
as Mawhiba program.
6) Create a Companion Program for Young ‘Hackers'
Create a companion program for those young hackers who thrive outside an academic setting. Supply
initial funds to establish this program from those organizations whose operations depend, for example,
upon SCADA control systems. After appropriate vetting and training these people can help to provide
real world assessments of the information security status of critical ICT systems. Enlist the support of

49 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

such organizations as the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Ministry of Labor, Ministry of Higher
Education, along with major companies and some of the midsize and smaller specialized companies.
The purpose is to create real world, but controlled, information security and cyber labs and facilities.
Here the Kingdom's youth can exercise both their hacking and defense skills, learn and improve their
capabilities, while in a real work environment. At the same time, they can be positively recognized for
their talents.
7) Develop a National Education and Training Program
Develop a coordinated national education and training program utilizing both formal education,
internships in government and industry, and extensive and continuing professional education in the
fields of ICTS allowing for an upward career path.
8) International Cooperative Exchange
Utilize educational, government and private sector resources and cooperatively exchange ICTS
activities with countries such as the GCC, and other countries friendly to the Kingdom.
9) Enlist International IS Professionals
Enlist top international IS persons on a temporary or permanent basis to provide training, teaching and
workshops to both Saudis and other compatible nationalities. This will combine the benefits of having
the best teachers and professionals with the networking benefits generated by the students and
attendees.
10) Utilize Existing Scholarships Toward Promoting Qualified IS Professionals.
NISS Information security environment structure shall utilize existing scholarships programs to
promote qualified skillful students abroad who are supported through KSA financial assistance and
studying IS , and encourage them to continue IS professional education and training..
4.5.3.1.3 Challenges and Issues
1) There is currently a shortage of qualified KSA citizen human resources with the requisite skills to
fill current and future information security positions due to employee retention problems and
salary and benefit inequities. Correcting these issues will require some changes in government
compensation and career planning for employees in the information security fields.
2) The salary for Saudi qualified persons has been reported to be low in comparison with other
professionals elsewhere. . While loyalty and dedication are a function of the individual, such
unfairness is a breeding ground for disgruntled people who believe they are being treated unfairly.
The insider threat has traditionally been the most dangerous. Reducing or removing such
unfairness in compensation for qualified persons may be a challenge, but not addressing it can
create major risks to the Kingdom.
3) Another challenge to meeting this objective is convincing the Kingdom's ministries that the
substantive improvement required in information security, dictated by the risks from the ICT
environment, is worth the extraordinary steps, cooperation and new approaches required to
increase the ICTS component of the Kingdom's human resource.
4.5.3.1.4 Measures of Progress
1) Reduction in percentage of vacant ICTS positions
2) Increase in percentage of ICTS positions filled by qualified Saudis

4.6 RE-ASSESSMENT AND AUDIT
The Re-Assessment and Audit strategy element includes outlining and developing an approach to a
common framework for security assessment, re-assessment and audits, which is based upon national
and international best practices, guidelines, procedures and policies. In addition, this element will
assist in the development of an approach to the certification and accreditation of new systems prior to
being placed into operation.
Protective security, including physical, personnel and information security are key enablers in
constructing and maintaining a productive and robust KSA Information Society and Economy.
Security risks must be managed effectively, collectively and proportionately to achieve a secure and
confident working environment.
Implementation of the strategic drivers described in this section is important to the success of the Reassessment and Audit strategy and will facilitate the development of associated action plans. Detailed
objectives, approaches and initiatives for this element are described below.

4.6.1

ELEMENT DESCRIPTION

The Kingdom recognizes that dependence on information technology and the information systems
developed from that technology to successfully carry out missions and business functions is prevalent
in today’s digital age. Integral components of an information system can include a range of diverse
computing platforms from high-end supercomputers to personal digital assistants and cellular
telephones. The need to assess and audit these systems and their components is an essential aspect of
the risk management process.
A national level strategy for re-assessment and audit will help to:







Determine the most efficient and effective mechanisms to obtain strategic warning, maintain
situational awareness and improve incident response capabilities
Improve the security posture of critical infrastructure systems
Determine the need to update or replace existing policies and technologies
Evaluate new technology
Uncover fraudulent or other illegal activities
Reinforce and strengthen internal controls

Assessments and Audits are ultimately aimed at studying processes for their improvement, but there
are distinct differences.
Assessments help to collect and analyze information and also present recommendations for decisionmaking. An Information Security Assessment is a formal, systematic process of data gathering,
regarding information security measures that are in place compared to an established set of criteria
(ISO 27001), in order to determine what needs exist. In other words, it is systematic analyses of the
way things are and the way they should be. Typical methods for conducting an Information Security
Assessment include:






Surveys
Interviews
Standards
Statistics
Record reviews

The assessment looks at the completeness of the security initiatives or program. By conducting the
assessment first, the organization can remediate any significant shortcomings before a security audit is

53 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

performed, which is a formal record of the security status of an organization as measured against a
specific standard.
Audits examine if the results of quality activities are in compliance with planned arrangements or
stated processes. Audits also check if the planned arrangements are effective enough to meet the
objectives for which they were set. An Information Security Audit is a systematic evaluation of the
security of the Kingdom’s information system, which is accomplished by measuring how well it
conforms to an established set of criteria that results in a factual record. Audit activities typically
focus on measuring the security of the system’s operations, configuration and environment, software
and information handling processes, as well as user practices. The Information Security Audit also
results in the determination of regulatory compliance in the wake of legislation (such as HIPAA and
Sarbanes-Oxley in the U.S., and eCrime laws in Saudi Arabia) that specifies how organizations must
deal with information. Typical methods for conducting a security audit include:






First hand (independent) observations
Custom designed testing of security controls
Independent monitoring of security controls
Placing historical information under scrutiny
Evidentiary collection via forensic analysis

The audit strategy must be specifically organized to provide a risk-driven methodology and
framework for tackling the enormous task of designing a national enterprise security validation
program.
The ultimate goal of the audit is to assist management in understanding the relationship between the
technical controls and the risks to the organization/business affected by these controls. The findings,
threats and vulnerabilities are explained and documented in a report, based on validated information
from evidence gathered and examined during the audit.
This brief description of audits is consistent with major certifying bodies such as the Information
Systems Audit and Control Association (ISACA), which is the international organization that issues
certifications for Certified Information Systems Auditors (CISA) and the Institute of Internal
Auditors.

4.6.2

RELATIONSHIP TO KINGDOM'S TOP ICT OBJECTIVES

KSA has identified several initiatives that address the need to combat cybersecurity crime, establish
enhancements and promote awareness. The establishment of a re-assessment and audit initiative, to
include certification and accreditation of all systems and a focus on critical infrastructure systems,
will provide KSA the ability to assess cyber threats, as well as information security enhancements.
System hardening guidelines become critical to ensure the success of all strategies to be implemented.

4.6.3

ELEMENT OBJECTIVES

4.6.3.1

Objective A-1: Assessment and Audit Methodology

Provide a Kingdom-wide harmonized ICT methodology for a system assessment, re-assessment and
audit program that is customized to the Kingdom's environment. The methodology should be based
on the principles of international standards such as ISO 27001 and 27002, as well as generally
accepted best practices, guidelines, procedures and policies.
4.6.3.1.1 Approach
The assessment and audit approach to be developed by NISE's information security National Risk
Assessment Function (NRAF) includes a number of security controls and consists of the following
steps:

54 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

1) Identify and quantify risks to critical assets.
Critical assets are those systems, processes or people any given service relies upon for normal,
sustained operation. Risk is defined as the potential that a threat will take advantage of a
vulnerability identified in a critical asset, thus impacting the continued operation of the associated
service.
2) Identify and quantify possible response to identified risks.
3) Select appropriate responses for implementation.
4.6.3.1.2
Implementation Initiatives
1) Evaluate the Security Controls
Evaluate the security controls established by the NISE NRAF using appropriate assessment
procedures. This evaluation determines the extent to which the controls are implemented correctly,
operating as intended and producing the desired outcomes, with respect to meeting the security
requirements for any system. A properly conducted assessment and re-assessment (continuous
monitoring) will help to:





Ensure that managing information system-related security risks is consistent with the
organization’s mission/business objectives and overall risk strategy established by the senior
leadership through the risk executive function.
Ensure that information security requirements, including necessary security controls, are
integrated into the organization’s enterprise architecture and system development lifecycle
processes.
Support consistent, well-informed and on-going security authorization decisions, transparency of
security and risk management-related information and reciprocity.
Achieve more secure information and information systems within the Kingdom through the
implementation of appropriate risk mitigation strategies.

4.6.3.1.3 Challenges and Issues
1) There are several dependencies in developing a re-assessment capability at the national level.
2) Documents that describe the Certification and Accreditation (C&A) requirements,
responsibilities, processes and authorities must be developed.
3) For KSA critical infrastructures, information must be developed that will assist in developing
analysis and identification of known issues and gaps in policies, procedures and practices, as well
as incentives affecting infrastructure preparedness and resilience.
4.6.3.1.4 Measures of Progress
1) Continuous monitoring will be measured by the ability of system owners to provide system
related risks that will feed up to the top of each ministry.
2) Policies and procedures to cost-effectively reduce information technology security risks to an
acceptable level will be implemented, which will, in turn, will be measured through structured
reporting.

4.6.3.2

Objective A-2: Baseline Security Standards

Develop a minimum baseline IT security standard for internationally accepted security configurations.
This provides the standard that trained information security professionals can use to produce and
conduct assessments, audits and certifications, as well as accreditation of existing and new systems.
4.6.3.2.1 Approach
Provide a minimum baseline security standard that establishes and defines the approved configuration
documentation for a system at a milestone event or at a specified time. Configuration baselines
represent:

55 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy





Snapshots that capture the configuration or partial configuration of a system at specific points in
time
Commitment points representing approval of a system at a particular milestones in its
development
Control points that serve to focus management attention

4.6.3.2.2 Implementation Initiatives
1) Baseline Inventories and Configurations
Establish and maintain baseline inventories and configurations of organizational information systems
(including hardware, software, firmware and documentation) throughout the respective system
development life cycles.
2) Security Configuration Settings
Establish and enforce security configuration settings for information technology products employed in
organizational information systems.
3) Reviews and Update of the Information System Baseline Configuration
Establish reviews and updates of the baseline configuration of the information system at specified
intervals, whenever required by defined events and as an integral part of information system
component installations.
4) Automated Maintenance Mechanisms
Employ automated mechanisms to maintain an up-to-date, complete, accurate and readily available
baseline configuration of the information system.
4.6.3.2.3 Challenges and Issues
1) Creating an enterprise asset database with systems and data about the systems is challenging to
conduct at the national level because of the daunting amount of data and the need to develop a
culture of trust among all participating entities.
2) Automating baseline configurations on an enterprise level from the ground up is a major
undertaking.
4.6.3.2.4 Measures of Progress
1) Establishment of a configuration baseline for identified major platforms
2) Establishment of a baseline reporting system

4.6.3.3

Objective A-3: Assessment and Audit Framework

Establish an assessment and audit framework to ensure the security and confidentiality of system
records and information, to protect against any anticipated threats or hazards to the security or
integrity of such records and to protect against unauthorized access to or use of such records or
information.
4.6.3.3.1 Approach
NISE Provides the certifier and accreditor with a structured process to perform a Certification and
Accreditation of a system, based upon a series of standardized assessment and planning templates.
(Templates for system security plans and system risk assessments are provided in the supplement
section.)
4.6.3.3.2 Implementation Initiative
1) Develop Templates
Develop IS assessment and audit templates, which are based on the principles of ISO 27001, 27002,
ITIL and Control Objectives for Information and Related Technology (COBIT).

56 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

4.6.3.3.3 Challenges and Issues
1) C&A will require each KSA ministry to develop, document and implement a ministry-wide
information security program to support the confidentiality, integrity and availability of ministry
operations and assets.
2) Each organization must document and provide evidence to executives and auditors that
appropriate plans and controls are in place, tested and monitored for effectiveness.
3) C&A is a labor intensive, complex and costly process that challenges even the most efficient
organization.
4.6.3.3.4 Measures of Progress
1) Establishment of draft audit templates

4.7 NATIONAL COOPERATION AND SHARING FOR INFORMATION SECURITY
This element of the NISS explores new processes to enhance internal coordination procedures. In
order for any country to realize the goal of becoming an information-secure society, all components of
the nation must work cooperatively toward a set of common goals. Achieving this across the many
sectors of the Kingdom will require new internal cooperation and coordination processes. Current
information security efforts are uneven between different ministries, across critical infrastructures, the
private sector and among the people.
In discussions with many nations across the globe, one of the essential requirements identified to
achieve an effective national approach to information security was the need for close and focused
internal coordination and communication processes. Experience has demonstrated that a country can
develop more uniform policies and emergency response procedures when all facets of the government
and private sectors work in a cooperative manner. This is especially true for information and cyber
security, where standardization, coordination and agility are vital components of a world-class
capability.
The approach to increase internal cooperation and information sharing is simple. The NISS focuses its
recommendations on specific sectors and specific issues that should form the basis of improving
national information sharing and coordination. Finally, this section proposes the creation of a program
that will both further enhance and test national information sharing initiatives, especially during
crises. Detailed objectives, approaches and initiatives for this element are described below.

4.7.1

ELEMENT DESCRIPTION

The national information security or cybersecurity strategies of many nations have identified as key
goals better cooperation and coordination between government sectors and between the government
and private sectors. Each ministry has unique capabilities, authorities, responsibilities and sector
insights that, when brought together in a collaborative manner will make the Kingdom stronger and
create a more secure environment to execute government operations and conduct business.
One example where internal information sharing processes were effective is the case of Estonia. One
of the keys for success in combating the Estonian cyber-attacks during May 2007 was the continuous
cooperation between the executive, civilian, national security, and private sector communities within
Estonia. Denmark is another example of a national coordination process that includes both multiministerial components and the telecommunications sector.
When combined with the other strategies outlined in the NISS, and executed through the
implementation initiatives outlined below, the Kingdom can also achieve this national imperative.

4.7.2

RELATIONSHIP TO KINGDOM'S TOP ICT OBJECTIVES

The Kingdom has already identified many goals, such as those outlined in the Ninth Development
Plan, the National Communication and Information Technology Plan, the Long-term Strategy 2024
and other strategic national documents and initiatives. Through these documents and initiatives, the
Kingdom has set the foundation for its vision and ICT direction, creating opportunities to develop the
IT industry, while being mindful of the need for a strong security foundation.

4.7.3

ELEMENT OBJECTIVES

The objectives outlined below are intended to enhance the Kingdom’s governmental and private
sector coordination process, to identify specific areas for improved coordination and collaboration and
to propose a method for testing and evaluation of coordination processes.

4.7.3.1

Objective N-1: Enhance Information Sharing Capabilities

Enhance information sharing capabilities of the following principal interfaces:


Ministry-to-Ministry
58 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy




Government Sector-to-Private Sector
Government-to-People

4.7.3.1.1 Approach
The approach to achieve this objective is to create new coordinating positions and collaborations to
facilitate the sharing of information, including cybersecurity information.
4.7.3.1.2 Implementation Initiatives
1) Ministry-to-Ministry
In this section the term Ministry-to-Ministry refers to any of the Kingdom's governmental
organizations.
The NISS proposes the creation of two new coordination bodies ‒ a Chief Information Officer (CIO)
Function and a Chief Information Security Officer (CISO) Function. The CIO Function is intended to
be a forum where government ministries can address emerging IT issues, which will allow each
ministry to discuss and coordinate common concerns and challenges, to receive insight into potential
solutions and capabilities and to leverage the knowledge of each ministry. Such collaboration will
result in the development of a set of best practices and standards that will lead to reduced costs and
better efficiencies.
The CISO Function will focus more specifically on ICT security threats to information systems and
cybersecurity matters. The CISO Function will be a critical capability to ensure ministries are aware
of new threats being detected within the Kingdom. The CISO will facilitate the transfer of threat
information, while being a resource for each individual ministry to gain knowledge on how to address
or mitigate threats.
By establishing these two national level Functions, the Kingdom will ensure it has the processes in
place to smartly grow and protect its governmental IT systems. The exact composition and charter for
each Function will be determined during the implementation phase of the NISS. However, a
suggested organizational structure is the NISE described in section 4.1 Information Security
Environment.
2) Government Sector-to-Private Sector
Government-Private partnerships are a critical step in the evolution of a national strategy to address
information and cybersecurity at the national level. These partnerships must occur at both the national
level and within all regions of the Kingdom. Section 4.4 National ICT Infrastructure identifies
models that have succeeded elsewhere and recommends a national strategy be developed. The NISS
approach is to leverage the work already being done within some sectors, for example energy and
banking, and to extend the outreach to other critical sectors with more involvement from the regional
governments. This will require new processes to encourage collaboration between regional
governments and industries, to develop trust and a true partnership, to minimize costs and to achieve
the goal of a more secure national economy and infrastructure.
The NISS recognizes that additional collaboration opportunities must be created between the
government and private sectors at both the national and regional levels. The national government
should create information sharing mechanisms to collaborate with local industry on security issues
facing industry, collect specific threat information detected by industry and provide national threat
and policy guidance to industry. The exchanges should be based on trust and established on a regular
periodic basis for maximum benefit.
3) Government-to-People
The third area for cooperative focus is informing the public about home and individual user
responsibilities for information security. Home users are often the most vulnerable, which has led to
infected digital devices, theft of personal information by cyber criminals, attacks launched from
compromised home systems and theft of financial data and banking information.

59 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

The NISS proposes tying public outreach with several other new initiatives under the NISS. First, is a
public outreach program run by the proposed National Information Security Environment (NISE).
This organization will create an office responsible for public outreach and awareness. Next, the new
national information security training initiatives, detailed in section 4.5 Human Resource, will teach
schoolchildren about information security and cybersecurity and how to behave responsibly on the
internet. Lastly, a sub-component of the National Cyber Exercise Program, described in section
4.7.3.3 Objective N-3 below can involve local training and exercises in which citizens can participate.
By unifying these efforts for public training and awareness, the Kingdom can become a global leader
in addressing the difficult problem of bringing cybersecurity into the home.
4.7.3.1.3 Challenges and Issues
1) Inadequate or non-existent coordination processes
2) Uneven security requirement development processes
3) Inadequate threat and vulnerability detection and information sharing mechanisms
4) Different ICT security standards and policies
5) Stovepipes between sectors
6) Uncoordinated or undocumented authorities and responsibilities
4.7.3.1.4 Measures of Progress
1) Creation of the position of CIO across the ministries and implementation of the CIO Function
2) Creation of the position of CISO across the ministries and implementation of the CISO Function
3) Creation of Public-Private Advisory Functions (PPAF) within each region
4) Establishment of an office responsible for Public Outreach and Awareness within the new
Information Security Organization

4.7.3.2

Objective N-2: Focus National Cooperation and Coordination

Enhance the following information sharing areas that require inter-governmental structures and
processes for cooperation and coordination:






ICT Security Standards and Policies
Research and Development (R&D)
Security Operations Center (SOC)
Vulnerability and Threat Information Sharing
National IS Incident Response Process

4.7.3.2.1 Approach
In addition to the Functions recommended in Objective N-1 above, the NISS identifies several
specific areas of cooperation that will greatly enhance national and organizational information
security efforts. By focusing on the topics of this objective first, the Functions will achieve more rapid
and uniform standards and capabilities.
4.7.3.2.2 Implementation Initiatives
1) ICT Security Standards and Policies
NISS section 4.2 Policy and Regulations addresses the creation of new IT security policies and laws.
The CIO and the CISO will play vital roles in deciding what new standards and policies should be
adopted, how they should be written, to whom they apply and when they should be updated or
discontinued. Many policies will be created by the national information security functions that will be
applicable to the national security sectors, so their unique perspectives, insights and participation are
necessary.

60 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

2) Research and Development (R&D)
It is vital for the Kingdom to further develop its own domestic capabilities in the area of ICT and
cybersecurity. This will help grow a domestic industry vital to the security of the nation and create
exciting job opportunities for university graduates. In order to achieve this result, research and
development activities require additional focus and oversight.
Creating a technology roadmap for research is one way of beginning this effort. Led by research
centers with requirements inputs from both the civil and national security communities, the roadmap
will shape the future research activities in information security for the Kingdom. In addition, creating
a centralized funding advisory capability for research will ensure the roadmap is implemented in
accordance with strategic goals and requirements.
To this end, the NISS proposes the creation of a Research and Innovation Function that will, in
coordination with King Abdulaziz City for Science and Technology (KACST), have oversight of a
program to provide research grants and funding for specific security developments.
3) Vulnerability and Threat Information Sharing
Sharing vulnerability and threat information is specifically identified as one area of cooperation that
requires special attention. The CISO Function will be one primary mechanism utilized to share this
type of information across the government. A Public-Private Advisory Function (PPAF) will be a
similar mechanism for industry. KSA’s Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-SA) can also
play a role. Finally, the national Security Operations Center (SOC) will be used to share more
immediate or urgent threat information. In the past, there has been a reluctance to share this type of
information.
However, trusted mechanisms to share the information do not exist. Countries that have overcome
these barriers have also had the most success in developing processes to mitigate threats across the
government. The NISS recommends that the Kingdom put into place mandatory reporting policies for
sharing cyber vulnerability and threat information.
4) National Incident Response Process
No matter how well the Kingdom is prepared to detect and defeat cyber threats, the threat of a largescale cyber incident within a ministry or across multiple sectors is real. In order to address such
threats, the NISS proposes the creation of a National Cyber Response Plan (NCRP). See section 5.2
Recommendations Outside the NISS Scope But NISS Related. The plan will include such elements
as national coordination responsibilities for the incident, individual ministries and private sector roles
and responsibilities, technical analysis and mitigation planning, an alert and notification process,
international collaboration and media coordination.
4.7.3.2.3 Challenges and Issues
1) Unclear authorities and responsibilities
2) Potential lack of trust between institutions
3) Competing resources
4) Inadequate existing coordination processes.
4.7.3.2.4 Measures of Progress
1) Effectiveness of the CIO and CISO Functions issuing national ICT security policy and guidance
2) Creation of a NISE Research and Innovation Function
3) Development of a National Research and Development Technology Roadmap
4) Creation of a centralized R&D funding mechanism for ICT security
5) Creation of a national Security Operations Center (SOC)
6) Integration of the telecommunications sector with SOC operations
7) Creation of a policy that mandates the sharing of ICT security threat and vulnerability information
61 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

8) Creation of a National Information Security and Cyber Response Plan

4.7.3.3

Objective N-3: Create a National IS and Cyber Exercise Program

Create a National Information Security and Cyber Exercise Program to enhance national coordination
and cooperation of activities related to information security.
4.7.3.3.1 Approach
Information security does not belong to one group or sector, but can be felt across all aspects of life
in the Kingdom. The NISS is proposing many new responsibilities and capabilities for information
security throughout the Kingdom. In order to achieve the maximum benefits of these capabilities they
must be tested through simulated cyber exercises. The final strategic objective in the NISS to enhance
national coordination and cooperation is the creation of a National Information Security and Cyber
Exercise Program.
4.7.3.3.2 Implementation Initiative
1) Implementation of IS and Cyber Exercises
This program will test some of the new capabilities and processes created by the NISS and are
intended to be flexible. That is, individual exercises can be customized to test and evaluate the entire
Kingdom’s IS and cyber response capabilities or can be targeted to individual segments of the
response process. The types of participants (called players) and processes to be tested are national
policy makers and ministries, authorities and responsibilities, coordination processes, technical teams,
private sector outreach, citizens, international partners and media.
Many countries have successfully tested and improved their processes by using exercises to evaluate
capabilities and improve processes in a cyber-crisis. The Kingdom must quickly develop appropriate
responses to such attacks. Creating a national information security and cyber exercise program and
integrating it into all sectors of society will greatly improve the Kingdom’s chances to withstand a
significant attack via remote means and involving the Kingdom's ICT assets.
4.7.3.3.3 Challenges and Issues
1) Experienced personnel who have designed and participated in similar exercises are needed.
2) Willingness by government and other sectors to participate realistically in the exercises is
mandatory.
3) Specific goals for each exercise must be developed and measured.
4.7.3.3.4 Measures of Progress
1) Creation and execution of the first national IS and cyber exercise
2) Expansion of the program to include additional institutions and players

62 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

4.8 INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION AND SHARING FOR INFORMATION SECURITY
This element focuses specifically on areas where the broader international community has significant
efforts underway and where specific international engagement at the governmental level is required.
Although most national information and cybersecurity strategies identify international cooperation as
a key objective, very few identify specific goals and objectives. Absent such concrete goals, nations
often do not understand how to leverage the benefits that can be derived from effective international
cooperation. It is critical that the Kingdom identify specific goals to be achieved through international
cooperation and partnerships.
The approach outlined here focuses on building strong international partnerships across an array of
organizations and initiatives to strengthen the Kingdom’s domestic information and cybersecurity
capabilities. In addition, a special emphasis on working with the international community in the area
of cybercrime is highlighted. Lastly, the NISS recommends approaches to acquire leap-ahead
technologies and training opportunities to enhance domestic information security research and
innovation. Detailed objectives, approaches and initiatives for this element are described below.

4.8.1

ELEMENT DESCRIPTION

The Kingdom must recognize that information and cybersecurity are complex issues with changing
technological and policy components. It is important that the Kingdom work in partnership with the
international community in order to achieve success. Our networks reach outside the Kingdom and so
too must our processes and relationships. International cooperation and coordination on these complex
issues and evolving ICT threats is vital to our nation’s information security posture and economic
future, as well as the development of a robust ICT infrastructure.
In order to fully realize KSA’s goals in information security, we must work more collaboratively, and
across a broad range of areas, with the international community. The NISS recognizes that the field of
information security and cybersecurity is exploding globally and is a major concern for all nations.
The Kingdom can improve its own capabilities through greater participation in, and cooperation with,
the many initiatives underway around the world. Other sections of the NISS also identify areas where
the Kingdom can benefit from greater international partnerships and collaboration.

4.8.2

RELATIONSHIP TO KINGDOM'S TOP ICT OBJECTIVES

Cabinet Resolution No. 82 has identified several recommendations that address the need to combat
cybercrime. In addition, other national strategies recognize the need to work with the international
community and experts to improve the Kingdom’s ICT security posture. A comprehensive
international engagement strategy and information-sharing plan must be created in order to effectively
and efficiently work with the international community.

4.8.3

ELEMENT OBJECTIVES

The NISS addresses the challenges of working cooperatively with the international community by
identifying the leading international organizations that should be engaged, specific areas of
international cooperation and different mechanisms to interact with other countries. The NISS calls
for critical cooperation between involved ministries and it positions the Kingdom to implement an
international engagement strategy that will enhance our information security posture. The objectives
outlined below frame the international engagement strategy required to achieve our national
information and ICT security goals.

4.8.3.1

Objective I-1: Strengthen the Kingdom's National Technical Capabilities

Strengthen the Kingdom's national technical capabilities through increased international cooperation
and sharing.

63 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

4.8.3.1.1 Approach
The Kingdom must leverage the international community to advance its own efforts in the fields of
information and cybersecurity. To accomplish this, it must position itself to take full advantage of
opportunities to learn and acquire the appropriate capabilities for its needs, based on targeted outreach
to international partners.
4.8.3.1.2 Implementation Initiatives
1) Phase I
Information gathering and sharing occurs across a wide variety of international organizations. Some
are focused on specific topics, while others are much broader in scope and purpose. The NISS
recognizes that new efforts are continually being created and the following list is not exhaustive, but
rather representative of leading international efforts. Although some are regionally organized, and
direct KSA participation may be limited, their outcomes often have global impacts on information
security and cybersecurity standards and processes. In Figure 4.8-1 International Organizations
Involved in Information Security and Cybersecurity, the leading international organizations are
arranged in alphabetical order.

Figure 4.8-1 International Organizations Involved in Information Security and Cybersecurity
Their efforts often have global impacts on information security and cybersecurity standards and processes.

Some KSA government elements are directly involved with these organizations today. However, a
comprehensive and systematic approach to gain required knowledge and expertise must be initiated.
The NISS recommends a top-to-bottom review and assessment of current engagement activities,
appropriate ministerial involvement, strategic goals and objectives and a strategy to improve
awareness, effectiveness and engagement of the myriad of policies, standards, information and
outcomes from these organizations.
2) Phase II
Phase II activities include direct government-to-government interactions and information sharing
activities. Phase II government engagements are intended to focus on very specific information
security needs. Due to the nature of these interactions, sensitive or even secret information may often
be exchanged. These engagements are integrated into larger national goals and objectives and will
usually be achieved by the following mechanisms:




Bi-lateral information sharing agreements
Multi-lateral information sharing agreements
Regional information sharing forums or agreements
64 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

Many countries have collaborated with key allies to significantly enhance their national cyber defense
and information security postures. That is the key goal of these Phase II relationships. In order to
mature the Kingdom’s ability to withstand national level cyber-attacks, protect its citizens from the
consequences of these attacks and further integrate technology throughout all levels of our society,
targeted engagements with specific countries are required.
The greatest benefit to be derived from these types of agreements is the enhancement of the
Kingdom’s own defenses through the acquisition of unique capabilities and access to international
experts, indications and warnings of new threats and mitigation strategies, threat awareness, incident
response and mutual defense activities. Inter-ministerial participation in these engagements will
reduce burdens on key technical experts and provide more breadth of experience across many
domestic ministerial authorities and capabilities.
Formal information sharing agreements between governments, while initially not easy to obtain and
execute, are one of the strongest mechanisms for securing the Kingdom’s expanding IT and cyber
infrastructure.
4.8.3.1.3 Challenges and Issues
1) International engagement in cybersecurity first requires national coordination. Effectively sharing
information between ministries remains a challenge unto itself.
2) Similar to internal information sharing, external information sharing relies on trust.
3) National interests are key factors in what types of information are shared. The Kingdom must be
able to identify what information of value it is seeking to acquire and share with international
partners.
4) This is an area of cooperation that must be developed over the long-term, as these relationships
take several years to develop and mature.
4.8.3.1.4 Measures of Progress
1) Establishment of a working-level international information security and cybersecurity forum to
inform other government ministries of activities, outcomes and strategies for international
engagements
2) Review participation in, and awareness of, international organizations involved in information
security and develop a comprehensive engagement strategy
3) Establishment of negotiated international information sharing agreements with strategic partners

4.8.3.2

Objective I-2: Combat Cybercrime

Combat Cybercrime.
4.8.3.2.1 Approach
The detection and limitation of cybercrime has been one of the few unifying international issues upon
which most nations have agreed. It is, therefore, deserving of its own specific listing as one of the
international objectives for the Kingdom. By quickly aligning itself with international standards and
capabilities to detect and respond to cybercrime, the Kingdom helps protect the Saudi government and
economy from cybercrime and fraud.
4.8.3.2.2 Implementation Initiative
1) Assessment of Current Efforts to Align With International Cybercrime Activities
The NISS makes an important distinction between internal cybercrime laws and procedures and the
requirements necessary when dealing with these issues at the international level. In order to
effectively operate on the international cybercrime stage, the Kingdom may need to forego a rigid
interpretation of its own legal standards and procedures and adopt a more flexible legal approach to
work cooperatively with international partners.

65 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

However, the cornerstone of working internationally in cybercrime is to have national laws and
procedures to combat cybercrime. Fortunately, as far back as 2007, the Council of Ministers created
the first national cybercrime law named the Anti-Cyber Crime Law. The Anti-Cyber Crime Law
identifies specific illegal activities and outlines punishments associated with various illegal activities.
With this law, and subsequent rulings and enhancements, the Kingdom has achieved the first
necessary step in working internationally to combat cybercrime.
The Council of Europe created the Convention on Cybercrime in 2001 that has been signed by nearly
50 nations and is the de facto standard on international cybercrime cooperation. However, many
developing countries now wish to re-open the international cybercrime debate and standards by
creating a broader internationally developed policy or treaty. The Kingdom must continue to engage
this issue on the international stage and assess whether it should align itself with and ratify the
Convention on Cybercrime or wait to develop a new international cybercrime document. The outcome
of this legal assessment, and KSA’s decision, will have impacts on national laws and capabilities.
4.8.3.2.3 Challenges and Issues
1) Domestic and international, as well as legal and cultural challenges arise when dealing with
cybercrime and the interpretation of legal standards, procedures and law. Domestically, Sharia
law can be applied to some forms of cybercrime. However, on the international stage, this will be
more difficult. Therefore, it is imperative that the Kingdom engage in the international discussion
of cybercrime, understand what issues or concerns need to be addressed and develop a strategy to
work proactively with the international community in this area.
4.8.3.2.4 Measures of Progress
1) Creation of a legal forum that focuses on cybercrime issues, both domestically and internationally
2) Development of an international cybercrime engagement strategy
3) Review and ratification of the Convention on Cybercrime, or participation in the dialogue on reopening the discussion of an international Cybercrime Treaty

4.8.3.3

Objective I-3: Expand Research and Innovation Through International
Cooperation

Expand research and innovation through international cooperation.
4.8.3.3.1 Approach
The final focus that the NISS highlights in international cooperation is research and innovation. The
primary approach is to undertake activities to grow domestic information security capacity. Outside
academic circles, real innovation is being achieved within smaller technology companies. This
provides many opportunities for the Kingdom to expand its own domestic capabilities in the rapidly
expanding and evolving cyber security and information security community.
4.8.3.3.2 Implementation Initiatives
1) Attendance at Specific Trade Shows and Trade Fairs
Trade shows for information security provide opportunities to view the latest mature technologies in
the market, as well as allow attendees to understand what is driving future requirements and needs.
The Kingdom needs a strategy to identify which trade shows should be attended, by whom, and how
the knowledge gained is fed back into government and private sector research projects on information
security. The Kingdom should also consider hosting its own yearly conference to attract the best
technology firms to display their offerings, which could increase participation by university students
and researchers. The ultimate goal is to have several Saudi companies display their products at
leading international trade shows.

66 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

2) Investment In, or Acquisition Of, Start-up Companies
Another area that would greatly accelerate and integrate innovation concepts and capabilities with a
Saudi brand is investing in new and emerging information security and cybersecurity companies.
Within the innovation community and new start-up companies, an infusion of cash is often all that is
needed to elevate a great idea into the research and development phases. In addition to the prospect of
investing in unproven technologies, potential acquisition of companies, although costly in the short
term, is a strategy that could pay dividends to the Kingdom in the long term.
3) Integration and Coordination of Domestic and International Research Efforts
To manage the international research and innovation engagement strategy, the NISS recommends that
the NISE's Research and Innovation Function be tasked with examining how to address these research
and innovation initiatives. Integrating domestic research work with the international approach will
generate additional capabilities and strategic guidance from this proposed board.
4.8.3.3.3 Challenges and Issues
1) Historically, government-to-government cooperation in this area has been difficult, due mainly to
the issues involved in teaming on sensitive research.
2) Developing/acquiring a skilled workforce to engage the international community in cutting-edge
research
3) Limited access to the world-wide innovation communities for information security
4.8.3.3.4 Measures of Progress
1) Issuance of mandate to the proposed NISE Research and Innovation Function to develop a
strategy that addresses the key areas for international information security engagement
2) Identification and participation in leading international conferences, followed by the sharing of
results within the Saudi R&D communities
3) Hosting of an international trade show for ICT security
4) Alignment with the innovation community

67 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

4.9 RESEARCH AND INNOVATION
The Research and Innovation element of the NISS is a strategy for creating the broad set of processes
and capabilities necessary to identify, focus, research, invent, develop, protect and, in some cases,
commercialize the unfilled information security (IS) needs of the Kingdom. This element includes the
development and support of the human resource necessary to produce the research and development
and production, as well as the entrepreneurs and marketers needed to successfully commercialize or
place into operation selected technology.
There is a need to identify and frame real world IS problems for the R and D community. Unless
there is need, innovation is useless. Some projects need teams with special skills and resources that
require coordination across organizations. In addition, there is always a need to increase the number
of inventions and patents, along with their utility and potential commercialization. Finally, to increase
the commercialization rate of R and D output, more innovation is often needed.
The approach is to identify the macro elements related to the Kingdom's NISS related research and
innovation objectives described in this section. In addition, the NISS Supplement contains a
description of five specific initiatives that can be started immediately to begin what will become a
foundation for the Kingdom's IS related research and entrepreneurial activities. In addition,
specialized courses by experienced inventors on research methods, improved patent searches and
patenting, advanced workshops and short courses on key areas of IS and cryptography can help
stimulate and focus researchers, developers and teams on problems of potentially high payoff.

4.9.1

ELEMENT DESCRIPTION

Successful research and innovation involves an output, which establishes a tangible result no matter
how modest. Building upon results in the real world becomes easier, even though the problems
become more challenging, because skills, new people and increased experience improve the
opportunity for success
The following five specific projects are described and analyzed in detail in the NISS Supplement:
1. Counterintelligence – a mission of vigilance to detect people and actions that seek to harm the
Kingdom or its citizens. We believe that a successful counterintelligence activity will require
successful completion of five related innovative research efforts. The efforts are very broadly scoped
and each one is expected to entail a great deal of planning, research and development effort, and
integration to bring the CI activity to fruition and guardianship of the Kingdom’s data against the
specific threat of an insider betraying the community trust.
2. Domains of Duty. It has been envisioned that the Kingdom will be linked together by an advanced
communications network and will generate, share and use information to advance the Kingdom’s
collective value, while providing great benefit to the populace. Subjects using this network and its
information resources, databases and data portals will need to be allowed (and also denied) access.
Further, there is a need to structure the network and its controls so that granting membership and
deleting membership is done in such a way that reinforces the community aspects of a Kingdom-wide
information system.
3. Steganography and Steganalysis. Because different steganography techniques are developed at
such a high rate and the detection of newly discovered techniques is expected to be very difficult and
take significant time, the greatest need for security is a technique that can be used to defeat
steganography and not necessarily detect its presence. It is suggested that this is an ideal problem for
university researchers to undertake within a security business incubator environment. The approach
might be to jam any steganography that is present. This could be done by adding noise to the host
elements or by overlaying a known message steganographically. Another valuable feature might be
the development of a stenographic-defeating technique that would have a high probability of defeating
steganography but not affect legitimate watermarking. The key to this approach may lay with
advanced error correction codes.
68 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

4. Avoiding Malicious Chips. Two areas are ripe for innovation and research. First, is the question
as to whether or not the KSA should invest in building a chip foundry within the Kingdom that is
operated by and for the Kingdom’s subjects. A foundry, and training the skilled technicians to run it,
is a significant undertaking and expense. It is suggested that the question be answered with respect to
the necessary scale and complexity of chips that are essential for secure functioning of absolutely
critical infrastructure within the Kingdom. It is further suggested that a first foundry effort not be
oriented to fabricating, using the most advanced integrated circuit technologies, but integrated circuits
that can be modularly combined to provide the critical functions. Such an effort will not result in the
fastest, smallest or perhaps most efficient integrated circuits, but the expectation of security may well
offset any cosmetic or any performance diminishments incurred.
5. Backup Keying Variable Distribution. Much of the world’s electronic security rests on public
key cryptography (PKC), a remarkable development within the latter half of the last century. It
presents us with the apparent ability of being able to communicate securely over an open channel
without any a priori distribution of keying material. The usual method is to establish a common secret
quantity between two or more correspondents and then use this common secret quantity to establish a
commonly held and commonly used keying variable. Therefore, it seems prudent because of quantum
computation for a modern technologically advanced e-network to consider a backup cryptography for
securely conducting the nation’s business. This calls for continual assessment and planning, as well as
appropriately scaled build-out of fallback cryptographic methods.

4.9.2

RELATIONSHIP TO KINGDOM'S TOP ICT OBJECTIVES

The Research and Innovation element of the NISS supports several of the Kingdom's top objectives.
These objectives are identified in the boxes below, including the National Science Technology and
Innovation Plan, the National Information and Communications Technology Plan and the Ninth
Development Plan.
National Science Technology and Innovation Plan (1426)
Fourth Strategic Principle: 2. Directing scientific research and technological development towards securing
the strategic requirements of defense and national security[1]
Tenth Strategic Principle: 5. Adopting the mechanisms required for the information security and protection

69 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

Chapter 4: Follow-Up Mechanisms and Implementation Requirements
National Information and Communications and Technology Plan [2]
1- Innovation and Creativity: Innovation and creativity are the main drivers for development and progress.
It is important to disseminate and spread concepts that encourage and promote innovation and creativity in
the society, in family, school and work environment.
2- Initiative: The spirit of initiative proved to have a profound effect on the industrial and commercial
progress of developed countries. This has been clearly reflected in the experiences of US and Malaysia.
Accordingly, the spirit of initiative should be encouraged and spread in the society, and ways of utilizing
this spirit to establish companies and organizations should be sought.
3- Acceptance of Failure: Acceptance of failure from an individual or the entity that made the attempt in a
positive manner, and from the society at large, is a supporting concept for innovation, creativity and
initiation and should be spread and encouraged at the family, school and work environment.
4- Productivity and Professionalism: Productivity and competitiveness are two of the main factors that
decide the strength of countries' economies and their competitive positions. The individual's productivity
and proficiency represent the major units in measuring the productivity and competitiveness of countries.
These concepts should be widely disseminated and deepened in the culture of the society.
Ninth Development Plan
2.4.5 Enhancement of Competitive Capacities[3]
Limited number of business clusters, which consist of several industries, companies and institutions, with
strong interlinks and interrelationships, leading to intensive interaction that contributes to increased
productivity, stimulates innovation, and generates new business opportunities.
The need to promote investment in research, development and innovation, as there is a shortage of specialists
in science and engineering, as well as weak linkages between the academic and the business communities.
The general objectives include:
 Moving the national economy to innovation-based competitiveness
 Improving competitiveness of national products in domestic and external markets
 Supporting competitiveness of non-oil exports and increasing their technological content
 Raising the general level of education and training and expanding scientific and technical education
 Intensifying processes of technology transfer, adaptation and indigenization in order to enhance
competitiveness and keep pace with globalization of production
 Expanding establishment of business clusters with strong multiple interlinks (forward and backward
linkages), and promoting merger of national companies, as well as closer collaboration with foreign
companies possessing advanced technologies

4.9.3

ELEMENT OBJECTIVES

The overall approach to the Research and Innovation element is to start with five quite different, but
we believe important, research projects as opposed to establishing a massive research and innovation
infrastructure. This will parallel some of the on-going initiatives that have not yet been identified.
There are five pillars upholding innovation, whether it is for information security or anything else:
1.
2.
3.
4.

Need
Support
Innovator Reward
Innovation Tools

National Information Security Strategy

5. Mindset
It is our assessment that the Kingdom has positioned itself well to encourage innovation by
developing these pillars, but there are things that can be done to progress faster and to realize the goal
sooner.

4.9.3.1

Objective R-1: Expand and Integrate IS Research Infrastructure

Develop a national research and innovation human, technical and commercial infrastructure.
4.9.3.1.1 Approach
The NISS proposes a Research and Innovation Function under the NISE, to initiate some or all of the
five specific projects and to identify the on-going information security activities, capabilities and
areas needing augmentation or restructuring. Specific initiatives can be created to increase the
synergy and critical mass of the information security efforts. King Abdulaziz City for Science and
Technology (KACST), universities and research centers should play major role in the Function.
4.9.3.1.2 Implementation Initiative
1) Prioritize and Initiate Some or All of the Five Projects
Prioritize and initiate at least some of the five projects with proper staffing and resources. The projects
are described above in section 4.9.1 Element Description.
4.9.3.1.3 Challenges and Issues
1) The Arab culture has a unique challenge to address. It is clear that some research and some
entrepreneurial activities will not be successful or, if so, perhaps not in the near future. Chapter
four of the National Information and Communications and Technology Plan states, "Acceptance
of failure from an individual or the entity that made the attempt in a positive manner, and from the
society at large, is a supporting concept for innovation, creativity and initiation and should be
spread and encouraged at the family, school and work environment."
To achieve the Kingdom's goals, it is vital that people are not afraid to accept challenging
problems or begin new business ventures. The following thought is a powerful one. On the path to
success, one will meet failure. A well-meaning effort should continue with a positive attitude and
with course corrections and modifications derived from the lessons learned from the failure.
Something useful has been learned even if it is simply to approach similar problems in a different
way.
4.9.3.1.4 Measures of Progress
1) Number of active projects
2) Number of active researchers
3) Number of patent applications filed with the Saudi Arabia Patent Office, the GCC Patent Office,
the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT) and the United States Patent and Trademark Office
(USPTO)
4) Number and size of self-sustaining derivative business ventures

4.9.3.2

Objective R-2: Develop a Review Process for Proposals

Develop an analysis and review capability for research and commercialization proposals.
4.9.3.2.1 Approach
The NISE Research and Innovation Function should develop the independent evaluation process for
research and development ideas and possible commercial IS projects. This includes an assessment of
the capability of the human resource requirement proposed and available for a successful project.

71 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

4.9.3.2.2 Implementation Initiative
1) Establish the NISE Research and Innovation Function.
Establish the National Information Security Environment (NISE) to provide the framework for the
NISE Research and Innovation Function.
4.9.3.2.3 Challenges and Issues
1) A primary challenge is to assure independence, objectivity and skill in the evaluation process.
Providing transparency and feedback to the proposer in the evaluation of the development ideas
and projects, in a manner that is independent of the political/social status of the human resource,
is one approach to achieving this.
4.9.3.2.4 Measures of Progress
1) Track the success or lack of success of the sponsored entrepreneurial ventures with factors such as
(i) time to reach the financial breakeven point, (ii) number of people employed and (iii) gross
sales.
2) Measure the analysis and selection of research projects by (i) number of papers published, (ii)
number of patent applications, (iii) number of projects that proceed to the development stage and
further and (iv) the total amount of outside funding that has been supplied.

4.9.3.3

Objective R-3: Support and Encourage Researchers and Entrepreneurs

Provide appropriate internal and external encouragement to all team members.
4.9.3.3.1 Approach
Create a positive environment of adequate funding, training, mentoring and incentives for those
organizations and people engaged in research, development, innovation, commercialization and
entrepreneurial activities.
4.9.3.3.2 Implementation Initiatives
1) Publicity Campaign
Produce a major publicity campaign, along with the establishment of the NISE Research and
Innovation Function and its mission.
2) Mentor Program
Encourage successful people in the Kingdom to provide assistance and mentoring to the newer
members of the human resource.

72 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

3) Reward Success
Create a program to highlight people successful in research, development, innovation and as
entrepreneurs. Publicize these successes through mass media, but especially within all levels of the
educational, vocational and business training institutions, clubs and professional organizations.
4.9.3.3.3 Challenges and Issues
1) Dissemination and penetration of the motivational materials into all Saudi communities,
regardless of a community's location and economic standing
4.9.3.3.4 Measures of Progress
1) Conduct the Saudi equivalent of Western focus groups.
2) Develop an on line feedback means to track the change in awareness of, and attitude towards, new
research ventures and entrepreneurial initiatives.
3) Measure hits and time spent on online videos of several types, some strictly publicizing the
opportunities, others should be of successful, and not so successful, experiences that encourage
the acceptance of reasonable risk after careful study of the proposed venture.
4) Incorporate and analyze evaluation criteria incorporated into the web site to collect viewer
feedback.
5) Track mentors and mentoring efforts showing (i) the number of mentors, (ii) the number of
separate activities being helped and (iii) the number of people enrolled and being supported in the
mentoring program.

4.9.3.4

Objective R-4: Adopt Project Planning and Tracking Tools

Adopt project and program planning, management and measurement tools and systems.
4.9.3.4.1 Approach
Establish compatible transparent management information systems for lifecycle project tracking and
management. The output is accessible to sponsors and stakeholders.
4.9.3.4.2 Implementation Initiative
1) Standard MIS Tools and Experienced People
Employ the standard MIS tools. However, using experienced people to assist with the initial planning
of each project is vital for its success.
4.9.3.4.3 Challenges and Issues
1) Some do not want their progress or lack thereof exposed. In these cases, we suggest they find
another profession or field of work.
4.9.3.4.4 Measures of Progress
1) Number of projects using MIS tools and the skill and experience of the various project managers.

4.9.3.5

Objective R-5: Develop a Strong Marketing Capability

Develop a strong marketing capability for the products ready for production.
4.9.3.5.1 Approach
Utilize successful companies within the Kingdom in strategic alliances to market information security
products and services.
4.9.3.5.2 Implementation Initiative
1) Utilize Experience of Companies Currently Marketing IS Products within the Kingdom
Identify companies already marketing information security products within the Kingdom and GCC
and contract with them to both market products and perform market research for needed products.
73 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

Encourage these companies to employ young Saudis in a training capacity.
4.9.3.5.3 Challenges and Issues
1) Information security products can be difficult items to sell. Structure contracts with appropriate
incentives, especially in the beginning.
4.9.3.5.4 Measures of Progress
1) The time it takes for this venture to become profitable
2) Value of sales and sales growth
3) Number of persons marketing the commercially viable or operationally deployable IS products
and services

RECOMMENDATIONS

5.1 NISS ELEMENTS AND HUMAN ATTRIBUTES
The NISS is a related set of elements that form an integrated national strategy, as illustrated by the
pyramid in Figure 5.1-1 Elements of the National Information Security Strategy. The driving force
behind the NISS implementation is the Human Resource (HR) component. With development of trust
and cooperation from a base of transparency, coordination and collaboration, the implementation is
designed to support the Kingdom's short and long-term ICT objectives necessary to achieve a
knowledge economy by 2025.

Figure 5.1-1 Elements of the National Information Security Strategy
The strategy's success depends upon the trust, cooperation, coordination and
collaboration of the human resource.

NISS FIVE-YEAR IMPLEMENTATION SCHEDULE

Detailed implementation recommendations are in each NISS Element section under Implementation
Initiatives. The chart in Figure 5.1-2 NISS Implementation Five-Year Timeline shows the project
progression for the first five years, and is a top-level summary of the main groupings of NISS
Elements, in order of priority to begin implementation of the initiatives.

5.1.2

TOP LEVEL NISS RECOMMENDATIONS

5.1.2.1

Information Security Environment

The first and primary step is consideration and agreement by the Kingdom on a secure and effective
Information Security Environment. International research shows that a centrally-managed information
security is the most effective and efficient. Because of domestic political factors, few countries are
able to implement an effective centralized organization that includes the defense and intelligence
sectors. However, most countries have or are working towards a secure and effective national
information security and cybersecurity for the protection of all the other ICT infrastructure and
information systems. The current ICT environment with borderless infrastructure connectivity makes
the threat, vulnerabilities and risk that one organization faces heavily dependent upon actions (or lack
of actions) of other entities inside and outside the Kingdom. This is why the traditional model of each
organization being responsible for its own information security no longer works. A central national
environment with information security oversight, guidance and monitoring of the nonmilitary/intelligence sector on behalf of the entire Kingdom is the best means of minimizing risk and
providing maximum assurance against both natural and manmade accidents, disasters, attacks and
exploitation. This information security environment shall be responsible for the detailed
implementation of the NISS objectives and recommendations.

5.1.2.2

Policies

The next step is agreement for, and development and adoption of, a set of national information
security policies. This, in turn, will lead to national standards and best practices. Each ministry agency
and organization should have the flexibility to adapt the policies and implement the standards
according to their individual circumstances.
76 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

5.1.2.3

Regulations

This includes an update of the Kingdom's regulations and laws to take into account the legal
challenges presented by the globally interconnected internet. The contents of a person's social network
page on such sites as Facebook, Twitter, YouTube or even a personal or organization's website can be
subject to unauthorized modification without the knowledge or permission of the owner. Hence, it is
possible for someone whose objective is to damage the reputation of a person, organization or the
Kingdom to surreptitiously plant false, inflammatory or pornographic information in an account. The
defense is to minimize the vulnerabilities by employing good security measures, but ultimately a
highly trained group of computer forensic specialists and investigators is needed to avoid falsely
convicting innocent persons.

5.1.2.4

Risk Assessment and Management

Risk assessment and the management of risks are necessary since there is no longer an absolute
defense against adverse events and attacks affecting information and ICT systems. This is because of
today's network interconnectivity and extreme ease of storing and transmitting and transporting (256
GB thumb drives can store 20 million pages of text) sensitive and classified information. A
companion to the risk assessment is a framework for ICT system assessments and audits to ensure the
appropriate standards and policies are being met.

5.1.2.5

National ICT Infrastructure

The technical infrastructure updating and hardening to a state of acceptable resilience takes longer to
achieve but is a vital element of the NISS. Again, the interconnectivity dictates a national architectural
framework, since all systems today will suffer successful attacks and/or some degradation due to
natural events or accidents or both. Planning and implementing measures to assure a minimum grade
of service is both prudent and necessary to achieve the Kingdom's evolution to a knowledge-based
ICT economy.

5.1.2.6

National and International Cooperation

Expanding the internal cooperation communication regarding attacks, threats, vulnerabilities,
mitigation techniques and best practices among and between the Kingdom's organizations is essential.
Today, not every ministry is connected to CERT-SA, which is an obvious starting point, but much
more needs to be done as described in the NISS section on National Cooperation. External initiatives
with numerous international organizations are needed for any nation, since in many cases immediate
mitigation against cyber-attacks depends upon international cooperative actions.
The sharing of information and establishment of a professional dialogue and trust regarding
information security and cybersecurity between friendly nations is important. This provides
information and cooperative preplanned actions that can improve the national defense from attacks on
the Kingdom's ICT systems and infrastructure (such as the electric, water, and petroleum SCADA
control systems) and those targeting valuable and sensitive information.

5.1.2.7

Human Resource

The major foundation block of the NISS, after the Kingdom decides upon an information security
environment and policy approach is the Human Resource component. The Kingdom has long
recognized and supported extensive development of Saudi citizens. The NISS extends this recognition
with a specific focus on the areas of IT, ICT and ICT security.
However, the NISS focus is a broader one than just an educational program and is based in part on
identifying unemployed work-ready Saudis that could rapidly become important contributors to the
needed IT and ICT security workforce. Two groups identified are females and skilled male hackers
with no formal degree, but very strong IT and ICT security knowledge. In many cases their capability
and knowledge is far beyond what is currently taught in the universities. With appropriate vetting and
training, they could provide much needed augmentation to the existing information security work
force.
77 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

An extensive program to identify, educate and train Saudis for upward mobile information security
careers is described. It is based on one major change to a situation that the analysis has identified as a
major factor in lack of skilled government IT and ICT security personnel. This situation is in part due
to the very great difference in compensation for qualified IT, ICT and ICT security professionals in
government positions and in private industry. The proposal is for a special compensatory premium to
be paid to Saudis in government purely based on their true capabilities and qualifications in these
fields. There should be no distinction based on gender or unvetted paper credentials.

5.1.2.8

Research and Innovation

Research and innovation take longer to bear fruit, but the NISS has identified some initial projects
that, in themselves, are valuable but are designed to expand the capability and success rate of
researchers, innovators and entrepreneurs.

5.1.3

CONCLUSION

With successful implementation of the NISS Elements, the supporting ICT security foundation should
be in place to support the achievement of the Kingdom's Long Term Vision in 2024.

5.2 RECOMMENDATIONS OUTSIDE THE NISS SCOPE BUT NISS RELATED
5.2.1

NISS AND CYBERSECURITY AND CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION

KSA efforts to improve the information security of information and communications technology
(ICT) and information systems (the scope of the NISS) are a fundamental and necessary national
effort for achieving the Kingdom’s long-term national objectives.
Figure 5.2-1 NISS Cybersecurity – CIP Relationships shows the relationship of the NISS to both
Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection. While all three have elements in common and the
NISS has elements unique to each, implementation of the NISS still leaves critical elements of
Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection unaddressed. Therefore, additional Kingdom
strategies for Cybersecurity and Critical Infrastructure Protection must be developed and implemented
in coordination with the NISS to cover the areas the NISS does not cover. Collectively, these
strategies provide the comprehensive and integrated efforts for national infrastructures required to
support the Kingdom’s ICT objectives, which in turn support the Kingdom's national security and
economic security objectives. The following figures illustrate this.
Figure 5.2-1 identifies the different areas of the three domains and the overlaps between each pair of
domains and the one area common to all three domains. Figure 5.2.1-2 Examples of Unique and
Overlapping Areas for Individual Domains provides examples of the seven different areas and
illustrates why the Kingdom also needs a Cybersecurity Strategy and a Critical Infrastructure
Protection Strategy to achieve the Kingdom's long term ICT and other national objectives.

Figure 5.2-1 NISS Cybersecurity – CIP Relationships
The different areas related to security/protection and resilience intersect
and overlap (see Figure 5.2-2 for examples).

Figure 5.2-2 Examples of Unique and Overlapping Areas for Individual Domains
These examples illustrate the need for three separate but synergistic KSA national strategies
for Information Security, Cybersecurity and CIP.

The important point here is that the NISS covers areas important to both Cybersecurity and CIP.
However, the NISS does not address all of the areas to sufficiently cover the security/protection and
resilience for these domains. Though Cybersecurity and CIP strategies each have areas in common
with the NISS, they must address unique aspects of their individual domains outside the NISS, which
will complement the NISS.

5.2.2

RESILIENCE

Another feature that is most often applied to critical infrastructure protection but can be applied to all
of the areas above is resilience. This is the ability to anticipate, absorb, adapt to and rapidly recover
from potentially disruptive event or failure. (Note resilience is a “system or infrastructure”
characteristic, which is a goal to achieve/approach depending on its criticality and type of
threats/hazards you want it to be “resilient” against). To maintain and increase the confidence of the
general public in the growing number of e-government services, the NISS Element of the National
ICT Infrastructure addresses resilience from the NISS point of view.

5.2.3

CYBERSECURITY OVERVIEW

Cybersecurity is an increasingly important challenge faced by the Kingdom. Many of the core systems
that underpin the economy and society are now enabled by information technology. While this has
created tremendous benefit in terms of efficiency, it has also necessitated a more systematic approach
to identifying and thwarting cyber-attacks and cybercrime. As the Kingdom's cyber infrastructure is
threatened, we will need to move quickly – both bilaterally and with private sector owners of critical
infrastructures. The Kingdom needs to respond jointly and effectively to any attack and that takes
expertise, preparation and cooperation. Achieving a cyber-resilient ecosystem is essential.
Cybersecurity is the newest and unique national security issue of the 21st century. The shift from
traditional hacker-based cyber-attacks to the use of offensive cyber weapons is the new reality. The
potent nexus between threat and vulnerability makes it imperative that traditional information security
strategies are enhanced but also transformed to a more resilient cyber security methodology.

80 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

A recent report by Security and Defense Agenda, “Cyber-security: The vexed question of global rules:
An independent report on cyber-preparedness around the world” (dated February 2012) assesses the
unprepared state of nations from a cybersecurity standpoint.
According to the above report on page 47:
 57 percent believe an arms race is taking place in cyberspace;
 36 percent believe cybersecurity is more important than missile defense;
 43 percent felt that damage to critical infrastructure was the greatest threat cyber-attacks posed,
with massive economic consequences; and
 America, Australia, the United Kingdom, China and Germany rank behind less populous
countries when it comes to cyber-readiness.
The report noted an interesting paradox in the area of national cyber health. The largest countries with
the most sophisticated internet access are the most at-risk but also are the most “cyber literate,” and
thus the best prepared to react if attacked. Countries with less sophisticated internet connections
generally are less vulnerable to cyber attacks.
Every day Gulf Cooperation Council businesses are targeted by nation-state actors for cyber
exploitation and theft. This consistent and extensive cyber looting results in huge losses of valuable
intellectual property, sensitive information, and jobs for the Kingdom. Many of the same
vulnerabilities used to steal intellectual property can also be used to attack the critical infrastructures.
Without an immediate Kingdom initiative to develop and implement a cybersecurity policy, the
Kingdom will continue to be at risk for a catastrophic attack to the nation’s vital networks - networks
that power essential services for continuity of national security operations and economic stability.

5.2.4

CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION

The KSA has correctly concluded that ICT will be an increasingly important underlying fabric
affecting all aspects of a society and will influence its future economic prosperity. How the security
and resilience functions of ICT and the information systems supporting critical infrastructures are
designed, operated and monitored for threats to their operations within KSA will also influence
perceptions of KSA by other nations within the international community, who are also addressing
similar issues.
The NISS is focused on the information security efforts essential for protecting ICT, information
systems and information. Within today’s world, ICT and information systems provide critical
functions and services that affect the operations of a nation’s national security systems, government
organizations, and private enterprises. As operational dependency on the ICT and electronic systems
increases, information security risks become more critical. Information security is not only an
essential enabling function but it must also provide countermeasures to vulnerabilities that can be
exploited. In addition, the implementation of the ICT, information systems, applications and
operational processes affects the availability, reliably and sustainably of those “critical” functions and
services in the face of disruptive events. One of the overarching goals for the NISS strategy is to
provide a strategy and direction for achieving an appropriate and sustained level of ICT security.
Each infrastructure operates within a unique set of requirements and collectively they contribute to
national security and economic security at various levels of criticality. Most critical infrastructures,
including those that perform national security functions, though generally fewer in number, perform
and support the most important and fundamental role a government must exercise; namely, assuring
national sovereignty and protection of its people. Government functions and services, such as
emergency services, are very critical and a variety of Government services are relied upon by its
people for essential services and the orderly functioning and economic wellbeing of the KSA. Many
private enterprises (but not all) provide some nationally critical operations and services that underpin
the effective operations of both government organizations, other private organizations’ operations and
a vast array of services to the people of KSA; for example, financial services.

81 | P a g e

National Information Security Strategy

It is important that critical infrastructure protection and resilience be considered a separate element of
an overall national security strategy. A separate Critical Infrastructure Security and Resilience
Strategy (CISRS) for KSA should be developed. It must focus on both the physical protection of key
assets and the security of ICT and information systems used within critical infrastructures. Without a
comprehensive CISRS, there can be no assurance that infrastructure security and resilience is being
implemented and operated commensurate with identified national-level risks and interdependencies.
The NISS only addresses the security and resilience needs for ICT and information systems. Though
the analysis identified a range of specific independent infrastructure efforts related to technical and
organizational infrastructure, there was no evidence of a comprehensive national critical infrastructure
protection program.
