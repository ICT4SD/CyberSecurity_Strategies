National Cyber Security Policy -2013

Preamble
1. Cyberspace1 is a complex environment consisting of interactions between people, software and
services, supported by worldwide distribution of information and communication technology (ICT)
devices and networks.

2. Owing to the numerous benefits brought about by technological advancements, the cyberspace
today is a common pool used by citizens, businesses, critical information infrastructure, military and
governments in a manner that makes it difficult to draw clear boundaries among these different
groups. The cyberspace is expected to be more complex in the foreseeable future, with many fold
increase in networks and devices connected to it.

3. Information Technology (IT) is one of the critical sectors that rides on and resides in cyberspace.
It has emerged as one of the most significant growth catalysts for the Indian economy. In addition to
fuelling India’s economy, this sector is also positively influencing the lives of its people through direct
and indirect contribution to the various socio-economic parameters such as employment, standard
of living and diversity among others. The sector has played a significant role in transforming India’s
image to that of a global player in providing world-class technology solutions and IT business
services. The government has been a key driver for increased adoption of IT-based products and IT
enabled services in Public services (Government to citizen services, citizen identification, public
distribution systems), Healthcare (telemedicine, remote consultation, mobile clinics), Education (eLearning, virtual classrooms, etc) and Financial services (mobile banking / payment gateways), etc.
Such initiatives have enabled increased IT adoption in the country through sectoral reforms and
National programmes which have led to creation of large scale IT infrastructure with corporate /
private participation.

4. In the light of the growth of IT sector in the country, ambitious plans for rapid social transformation
& inclusive growth and India’s prominent role in the IT global market, providing right kind of focus for
creating secure computing environment and adequate trust & confidence in electronic transactions,
software, services, devices and networks, has become one of the compelling priorities for the
country. Such a focus enables creation of a suitable cyber security eco-system in the country, in
tune with globally networked environment.

5. Cyberspace is vulnerable to a wide variety of incidents, whether intentional or accidental,
manmade or natural, and the data exchanged in the cyberspace can be exploited for nefarious
purposes by both nation- states and non-state actors. Cyber attacks that target the infrastructure or
underlying economic well-being of a nation state can effectively reduce available state resources
and undermine confidence in their supporting structures.

A cyber related incident of national

significance may take any form; an organized cyber attack, an uncontrolled exploit such as
computer virus or worms or any malicious software code, a national disaster with significant cyber
consequences or other related incidents capable of causing extensive damage to the information
infrastructure or key assets. Large-scale cyber incidents may overwhelm the government, public
and private sector resources and services by disrupting functioning of critical information systems.
Complications from disruptions of such a magnitude may threaten lives, economy and national
security. Rapid identification, information exchange, investigation and coordinated response and
remediation can mitigate the damage caused by malicious cyberspace activity. Some of the
examples of cyber threats to individuals, businesses and government are identity theft, phishing,
social engineering, hactivism, cyber terrorism, compound threats targeting mobile devices and smart
phone, compromised digital certificates, advanced persistent threats, denial of service, bot nets,
supply chain attacks, data leakage, etc. The protection of information infrastructure and preservation
of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information in cyberspace is the essence of a secure
cyber space.

6. There are various ongoing activities and programs of the Government to address the cyber
security challenges which have significantly contributed to the creation of a platform that is now
capable of supporting and sustaining the efforts in securing the cyber space. Due to the dynamic
nature of cyberspace, there is now a need for these actions to be unified under a National Cyber
Security Policy, with an integrated vision and a set of sustained & coordinated strategies for
implementation.

7. The cyber security policy is an evolving task and it caters to the whole spectrum of ICT users and
providers including home users and small, medium and large enterprises and Government & nonGovernment entities. It serves as an umbrella framework for defining and guiding the actions related
to security of cyberspace. It also enables the individual sectors and organizations in designing
appropriate cyber security policies to suit their needs. The policy provides an overview of what it
takes to effectively protect information, information systems & networks and also gives an insight
into the Government’s approach and strategy for protection of cyber space in the country. It also
outlines some pointers to enable collaborative working of all key players in public & private to
safeguard country’s information and information systems. This policy, therefore, aims to create a
cyber security framework, which leads to specific actions and programmes to enhance the security
posture of country’s cyber space.
