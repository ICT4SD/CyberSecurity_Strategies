     Information security is about how to maintain the               Public authorities play a central role in facilitating  
     confidentiality, integrity and availability of information      and influencing how ICT is developed and applied  
                                                                     in society. This is also true for information security.  
     Integrity –  Ensuring that information and information          This is achieved in part through the formulation and  
     processing is comprehensive, accurate and valid, and            enforcement of laws and regulations, inspections,

     available when needed                                           The Government has the primary responsibility for

  The Ministry of Transport and Communications  
  is responsible for ICT security in electronic  
  communications networks and services, including  
  Internet. The electronic communications sector is  
  regulated by the Electronic Communications Act and  
  its regulations. The Post and Telecommunications  
  Authority, a government agency under the  
  Ministry of Transport and Communications, has a  
  special responsibility for security and emergency  
  preparedness for electronic communication networks  
  and services. 

  Although information security is primarily an  
  organisation and sector responsibility, our increasingly  
  networked society demands a comprehensive  
  approach. ICT infrastructure and security challenges  
  cut across established businesses and sectors.  
  Effective protection of ICT infrastructure will require  
  good coordination between public authorities,

   Appendix A:  
  Terms and Expressions 

    Accessibility                   Assurance that a service meets certain requirements for stability, such that the  
                                    information is available when needed. 

    CERT                            Computer Emergency Response Team. A team of experts that handles security  
                                    incidents. CERT is a registered trademark of Carnegie Mellon University. Many  
                                    therefore use the abbreviation C(S)IRT; Computer (Security) Incident Response  
                                    Team. 

    Cloud computing                 A collective term for services provided over the Internet and which are set up to  
    (cloud services)                work with other services. A designation for everything from data processing and  
                                    storage to software on servers in remote server farms connected to the Internet. 

    Confidentiality                 Assurance that specific information is not disclosed to unauthorised persons, and  
                                    that only authorised persons have access. 

    Critical ICT                    Critical ICT infrastructure is defined as critical infrastructure for electronic  
    infrastructure                  communications. See also ICT infrastructure. 

    Critical infrastructure         Society’s functional ability is highly dependent on a number of physical and  
                                    technical infrastructures. In the event of a failure in these infrastructures,  
                                    society will be unable to maintain the supply of goods and services on which the  
                                    population depends (cf. critical societal functions). These infrastructures can be  
                                    described as critical to society. 

    Critical societal               Functions that fulfil society’s basic needs and people’s sense of security,  
    functions                       e.g. banking and financial services, health services, etc. See also critical  
                                    infrastructure. 

    CSIRT                           Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) is a group of experts who  
                                    handle ICT security incidents. 

    Cyber security                  Protection of data and systems connected to the Internet.

                                    which a unit or organisation is dependent to function effectively. 

    ICT security                    How business-critical electronic networks and systems that process data or  
                                    communicate with each other are protected. 

    ICT systems                     See Information systems. 

    Information security            Protection of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information.

Information security           A management system and guide for organisations with regard to information  
management system               security. May include tools such as: 
                                •  Information security handbook 
                                •  Risk and vulnerability analysis 
                                •  Compliance audits 
                                •  Emergency plans 
                                •  E-learning about information security for the entire organisation 

Information systems             System for collecting, storing, processing, transmitting and presenting data. 

Infrastructure                 The basic structures and systems* necessary for an organisation, a collection of  
                                organisations, or a country to function effectively. 
                                *structures and systems: “Technical installations and equipment, and related  
                                administrative and organisational measures.” 

Integrity                      Assurance that information and information processing is comprehensive,  
                                accurate and valid, and the result of authorised and controlled activities.  

Sensitive information           Used in this strategy as a collective term for information that must be protected  
                               for various reasons, cf. Personal Data Act, Freedom of Information Act, Public  
                               Administration Act, Security Act, etc. 

Threat                         An entity that constitutes a real or potential threat to an identifiable goal or in a  
                                limited and identifiable context. 

Vulnerability                  The challenges a system will have to face to function when subjected to an  
                                adverse event, and challenges related to resuming normal system operation  
                                after the event has occurred. The vulnerability of a system is an expression of  
                                its weaknesses and flaws and special circumstances that would increase the  
                                likelihood that threats will materialise into a security incident (examples of  
                                special circumstances can include size, complexity, that many stakeholders are  
                                involved, geographical distribution, frequent changes, and exposed location). A  
                                system’s vulnerability is reduced by increasing the system’s robustness.  

                                                                                                                        29
