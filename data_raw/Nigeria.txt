                     FOREWORD BY THE NATIONAL SECURITY ADVISER  
                                                                  
  

The emergence of cyberspace, a virtual global domain, is increasingly impacting almost every aspect  

of our lives. The domain is transforming our economy and security posture more than ever before,  

creating opportunities for innovations and the means to improve general welfare of the citizens. It  is  

transforming  many countries’  growth,  dismantling  barriers  to  commerce,  and  allowing  

people  across the globe to communicate, collaborate and exchange ideas.    

   

However, behind this  increasing dependence on cyberspace  lies  new  risks that threaten  

the national economy and security. Sensitive data, networks and systems that we now trust  

can  be compromised or  impaired,  in  a fashion that detection  or  defence  can  be  hard,  

thus undermining our confidence in a connected economy.  

  

The Federal government is not unmindful of the diversity of implications of the nation’s risk exposure  

in cyberspace, hence we have put in place cohesive measures towards addressing national risks  

effectively now and in the immediate future. Furthermore, the government has recognized that  

for Nigeria and its citizens to  continue  to  benefit  from  the  full  potential  of  information  

and  communication technology revolution, we must take the cyber-risks seriously. It is  

on  this  premise  that  we  are  determined  to  confront  the  threats,  uphold  and  support  

the  openness of  the  cyberspace  as  well  as  balance  security  with  respect  to  privacy  

and fundamental  rights.  If  we  fail  to  prepare  now  and  act  appropriately,  we  may  be  

faced with future challenges that will be more complex to manage.  

   

In this context, government has developed a National Cybersecurity Strategy as cohesive national  

measures  towards  addressing  the  challenges.  These  measures  contain  strategic  initiatives  and  

programs  that  are  aligned  with  the  national  doctrines,  principles,  vision,  goals  and  objectives  as  

enshrined in the National Cybersecurity Policy. The strategy recognizes three key approaches to  

a  successful  national  cybersecurity  engagement:  public  private  sector  partnership;  stakeholders’  

collaborations and international cooperation.  

  

Our  commitment  is  to  ensure  continuity  of  government  in  the  advent  of  cyber  threat  

emergency,          safeguard         critical     information        infrastructure,        and      nurture      national  

cybersecurity readiness through the engagement of all stakeholders.   

It  is  in  the  light  of  the  above  that  my  office,  in  collaboration  with  other  agencies  of  

	 

----------------------- Page 3-----------------------

government  and  key  actors  from  the  private  sector  are  championing  the  urgent  

need  for  comprehensive  national  cybersecurity  programmes.  It  is  my  hope  that  the  

synergy        already        developed          between        the     stakeholders           drawn       from      different  

backgrounds will  be  sustained  through  all  the  implementation  stages.  My  office  will  

continue        to    explore       common          grounds         around        which       we     can      sustain       this  

collaboration  on cybersecurity for the common good of our country.  

     

We   shall   keep   all   channels   open   for   close   monitoring   and   evaluation   of   the  

implementation of this policy, which shall be due for comprehensive review in another  

five years. My office shall facilitate regular collation of feedback from stakeholders that  

will enhance periodic review of the process.   

I  therefore  wish  to  express  my  appreciation  to  the  cross  section  of  contributors  and  

stakeholders, including professional bodies, corporate leaders and captains of industry  

who  have  contributed  to  our  efforts  towards  creating  an  enduring  safer  digital  

environment for our dear country.

                                   EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  

  

The economy of a modern Nigeria is anchored and sustained on two major infrastructural  

landscape  (i.e.  Physical  and  Digital)  working  together  to  sustain  critical  and  non-critical  

sectors  of  the  economy  in  Government,  Manufacturing,  Dams,  Defence,  Chemical  

Sector  {Oil  and  Gas},  Power  and  Energy,  Commercial  Facilities,  Financial  Services,  

Food and Agro-allied, Emergency Services Transportation Systems, Public Health and  

Healthcare  Sector,  Water  and  Waste  Water  systems.  Digital  infrastructure  is  the  

National   Information   Infrastructure   (NII)   component   that   permeates   the   physical  

infrastructural     landscape       supporting      it  to   function     seamlessly,       endlessly     and  

sustainably.  The NII is the backbone of the nation’s active presence in cyberspace.  

Significant  disruption  of  its  operation  will  undermine  the  confidentiality,  integrity  and  

availability  of  essential  national  services,  which  will  be  inimical  to  national  economy  

and security.  

In comparison with other industrial and commercial entities, the Internet has been with  

us  for  a  relatively  short  period  of  time.   It  has  been  responsible  for  the  most  

revolutionary  and  rapid  changes  to  the  way  we  communicate,  undertake  business,  

perform  job  functions  as  well  as  boost  our  military  strategies.  We  have  seen  the  

examples in the  home schooling, social media and cloud computing  rising  on the tails  

of the Internet phenomenon.   

The  Internet  has  given  the  phrase  “global  village”  an  appropriate  meaning,  this  is  

driven home with the illustration that an individual in Nigeria can immediately set up an  

online conference call and chat with group of people on the other side of the planet in  

real-time.  The  majority of users of the Internet conduct their activities in a legitimate  

and above board manner, while on the other side of the internet there are individuals,  

organisations, foreign intelligence agencies and state sponsored actors that have used  

the very benefits of the internet, i.e. its speed, global presence and openness, to carry  

out criminal activities that can cause havoc to those that are not aware, prepared or  

equipped to deal with such undertakings.  

This document therefore examines the strategic imperative of a national cybersecurity.  

It highlights various strategies that will be used to implement the measures outlined in  

the new National Cybersecurity Policy.  

	 

----------------------- Page 8-----------------------

These include the following:  

     •   The  development  and  implementation  of  appropriate  legal  framework,  with  

         initiatives that will allow for the identification and prosecution of cybercrimes that  

         impact  Nigeria  regardless  of  whether  they  originate  within  Nigeria  or  are  

         launched  from  outside  of  the  country.  It  encompasses  training  the  judiciary,  

         security  and  law  enforcement  agencies,  seeking  international  co-operation,  

         public  and  private  sector  co-operation  and  public  awareness  programmes.  It  

         also   introduces   a   special   focus   on   data   protection,   privacy   and   lawful  

         interception.  

           

     •   Establishment of a National  Incidents  Management Strategy which outlines the  

         commissioning  of  a  National  Computer  Emergency  Response  Team  (CERT)  

         and  introduces  the  roadmap  for  implementing  Detective,  Preventative  and  

         Response capabilities to deal with cybercrime activities.  

           

     •   The strategy  for  Protecting  Critical information Infrastructures including shared  

         responsibility between government and owner operators of critical infrastructure.  

         It also highlights the ways in which early warning, detection, reaction and crisis  

         management  will  be  assessed,  developed  and  implemented  to  provide  a  

         proactive readiness to react to and deal with threats towards Nigeria’s Critical  

         Infrastructures.   

           

     •   The strategy seeks to ensure the development of information security assurance  

         and  monitoring  plan.  It  includes  a  new  national  mechanism  on  cybersecurity  

         assurance,  adoption  of  fit  for  purpose  standards  for  Governance,  Risk  and  

         Control,      Core     Assurance        Capabilities,       National     Enterprise       Architecture  

         Framework. It also endorses the adoption of application security testing as well  

         as the adoption of a Balanced Scorecard Framework for cybersecurity.  

     •   The  introduction  of  a  sustainable  strategy  to  develop,  maintain  and  ensure  

         Nigerians  are  informed  and  equipped  to  deal  with  cybersecurity  events  by  

         establishing a mechanism for Cybersecurity Skill and Manpower Development  

         initiatives.  These  initiatives  will  be  driven  through  public-private  partnership.  It  

         introduces   a   model   for   certification   of   individuals   to   ensure   quality   of  

         competence in the field of cybersecurity relevant to the nation.

       •     The strategy for protecting Nigerian Children from Online Child Exploitation and  

             Sexual Abuse includes initiatives,  such as the  national awareness programmes  

             through  multi-stakeholder  engagement,  and  international  cooperation  in  the  

             countermeasures.  

               

       •     The Strategy on Public-Private Partnership highlights the need for interagency  

             collaboration  with  private  sector.  It  engages  the  framework  for  a  public  and  

             private partnership in developing a cohesive response to mitigating cyber-risk.  

In  conclusion,  The  National  Internet  Safety  initiative  is  aimed  at  providing  general  

public awareness, education, and advocacy through multi-stakeholders’  engagement,  

development  of  local  tools,  training  software  and  applications  in  Internet  safety  and  

security  readiness.  It  provides  mechanism  for  gauging  the  nation’s  cyber  security  

posture.

         AN OVERVIEW OF NATIONAL CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY  

1.1       Introduction:  
       
1.1.1     National  Cybersecurity  Strategy  (NCSS)  is  the  nation’s  readiness  strategy  to  

          provide cohesive measures and strategic actions towards assuring security and  

          protection      of   the    country      presence        in   cyberspace,        safeguarding         critical  

          information infrastructure, building and nurturing trusted cyber-community.   

           

1.1.2   The  NCSS  comprises  of  short,  medium  and  long  term  mitigation  strategies  

          covering  all  national  priorities,  addressing  the  nation’s  cyber  risk  exposure.  

          Specific key cyber threats worldwide inimical to National interest are identified.  

          Such as;  

              i.    Cybercrime  

             ii.    Cyber-terrorism   

            iii.    Cyber conflict  

            iv.     Cyber espionage  

             v.     Child online abuse and exploitation.   

                      

1.1.3   These threats have significant capability to damage the integrity of the nation,

1.3.      The Aim of National Cybersecurity Strategy:  

          The   aim   of   the   NCSS   is   to   provide   a   cohesive   roadmap,   initiatives,   and  

          implementation mechanism for achieving the national vision on cybersecurity.   

            

1.4       Cyberspace Within the Context of National Prosperity & Opportunities:  

1.4.1   Cyberspace offers excellent platforms and opportunities for securing and growing  

          the nation’s economy.   

1.4.2   Every citizen that is connected to cyberspace through the internet is immeasurably  

          impacted and empowered for actions.   

1.4.3     In  the  next  few  years,  Nigeria  will  become  a  broadband  economy  where  every  

          individual  and  corporate  citizens  will  have  unhindered wholesome  access  to  the  

          internet.  

1.4.4     Cyberspace  will  become  the  mainstream  for  national  integration  and  digital  

          economy empowerment. It is a knowledge driven space with massive capacity to  

          bridge gaps in mobility, commerce, innovations, education, poverty reduction, and  

          economic empowerment.

1.4.5     What is the Cyberspace?  

            

          Cyberspace  is  an  interdependent  network  of  critical  and  non-critical  national  

          information   infrastructures,   convergence   of   interconnected   information   and  

          communication  resources  through  the  use  of  information  and  communication  

          technologies.  It  encompasses  all  forms  of  digital  engagements,  interactions,  

          socializations  and  transactional  activities;  contents,  contacts  and  resources  

          deployed        through        interconnected           networks.        –     Culled      from      National  

          Cybersecurity Policy 2014    

            

1.4.6     Why is Cyberspace important to the National Government?  

            

            

          It has been established that we have the contemporary four (4) domains of land,  

                                                                                                        th 
          Sea, Air and Space, Nigeria recognizes Cyberspace as the fifth (5  ) domain  for  

          driving critical national functions such as economic development,  commerce  

          and     transactions,          social     interactions,       medical       and     health,     government  

          operations, national security and defense.   

  

1.5        Impact of Cyber-Risk on National security and the Economy  

1.5.1     The nation’s digital economic existence relies on the effective functioning of digital  

          infrastructure. In Cyberspace, the country is not isolated but interconnected to other  

          countries and active actors within cyberspace through interdependent  networks of  

          information  infrastructures.  Thus,  the  country  is  exposed  to  predictable  and  

          unpredictable risks.   

1.5.2   Just as we have actors with legitimate intentions so also exist other actors with  

          illegitimate and malicious intentions. Within the global network of networks there  

          are  critical  structural  flaws  which  can  be  exploited  for  criminal  intents  and  

          purposes   against   the   country   to   compromise   the   confidentiality,   integrity,  

          availability   and   accessibility   of   the   nation   information   systems   and   critical  

          information infrastructure.   

            
	 

----------------------- Page 13-----------------------

1.5.3    Vulnerabilities  exist  within  cyberspace  that  can  be  used  to  exploit  national  

         economic interest and constitute threats to National Security. For instance, recent  

         compromise  of  some  government  websites,  growing  underground  cybercrime  

         industry,  emergence  of  activism  through  online  backdoors,  fraudulent  practices,  

         incidence  of  online  exploitation  of  the  young  segment  of  the  population,  gross  

         abuse of the social media for waging malicious campaign against the state, conflict  

         and violence perpetuated through internet, economic sabotage through distributive  

         denial  of  critical  services,  coordinated  cyber  espionage,  malicious  intrusion  into  

         computer systems and other digital devices, cyber piracy and stealing of intellectual  

         assets, cyber-terrorism, online financial crime and money laundering, distribution of  

         offensive contents and child abuse materials and hosts of other malignant activities  

         committed through cyberspace are all inimical to the wellbeing of the country. The  

         economic impact is destructive to any nation.   

1.6       Cybersecurity within the context of National Security Strategy:  

         Providing  security  for  the  critical  information  infrastructure  and  other  critical  

         components  of  information  system  within  the  current  state  of  affairs  is  a  huge  

         national challenge.   

         National Security needs the infusion of a cohesive framework on cybersecurity to  

         provide holistic approach to the current and future security landscape, because the  

         nation security and economic terrain is fast paced and is moving towards a digitally  

         enabled and mobile terrain.   

         State  and  non-state  actors  involved  in  cyber-crimes  are  adequately  equipped  

         with sophisticated cyber tools to cause damage with unprecedented dimension.  

         The  security  inclusion  of  cyberspace  domain  will  help  the  country  prepare  and  

         response to such security threat and help address the country’s weakness in her  

         own     digital   vulnerability,     as    well    as   strengthening        our   ability   to   provide  

         countermeasures  in  partnership  with  other  legitimate  state  and  non-state  actors.  

         This is the strategic rationale for the development of National Cybersecurity Policy  

         and  the  context  within  which  National  Cybersecurity  Strategy  is  articulated  for  

         national security readiness.

           UNDERSTANDING NATIONAL CYBER-RISK EXPOSURE  

                                                           

2.1      Introduction  

         In  line  with  the  national  doctrine  on  cyber-risk  exposure  as  reflected  in  the  

         National  Cybersecurity  Policy  document,  the  country  presence  in  cyberspace  

         exposes it to a new dimension of risk. Therefore, development of the country’s  

         Cybersecurity Strategy is approached from examining security risk exposure of  

         the whole country.   

         What Is Cyber-risk?  

         Cyber  risk  is  the  possibility  that  a  threat  and  vulnerability  exists  within  the  

         nation’s  cyberspace  inimical  to  the  security  and  safety  of  information  systems  

         and  associated infrastructures. Furthermore, it is the possibility that the threat  

         will  exploit  a  vulnerability  to  breach  the safety and  security  of  an  information  

         system and or information networks or infrastructure.  

         National cyber-risk has two (2) major components:   

            i.    Cyber-threat   

           ii.    Vulnerability    

                    

2.2      Cyber-threat Landscape & Impacts:  

           

2.2.1    Cyber threat is the possibility of a malicious attempt to damage or disrupt the 	 

         operations of a vulnerable computer network and information system. 	 

                    

2.2.2    The nature and the dimension of the impact of cyber-threat are diverse  and  it  

         involves   a   threat   actor   who   performs   a   pre-mediated   attack   or   exploit  

         circumstances  of  an  accident.  A  threat  actor  is  engaged  by  a  threat  source  

         either  clandestinely  or  tactically.  A  threat  source  initiates  a  desire  to  breach  

         access  to  critical  information  or  security  controls with  the  purpose  of  benefiting  

         from  the  breach,  for  example  for  financial  gain  or  competitive  advantage  in  the  

         case of industry cyber espionage.

2.2.3   Cyber  threat   is  escalated  to  cyber-attack   by  a  threat  actor  where  a  

          deliberate  effort  is  initiated  to  exploit  the  vulnerability  of  computer  systems,  

          information  and  communication  networks,  and  internet  driven  processes  for  

          criminal intent and malicious purpose.   

            

2.2.4     It usually involves the use of malicious codes to alter digital codes, logic or  

          data,     resulting       in   disruptive       consequences             that    can     compromise           the  

          confidentiality,  integrity,  and  availability  of  data  and  lead  to  manipulation  of  

          information systems and internetwork infrastructure.   

            

2.2.5   Cyber-attacks  may  lead  to  the  following  consequences:  Identity  theft,  fraud,  

          extortion,       Malware,        pharming,        phishing,       spamming,          spoofing,        spyware,  

          Trojans       and      viruses,      manipulation          of   hardware,         denial-of-service          and  

          distributed  denial-of-service  attacks,  breach  of  access,  password  sniffing,  

          system  infiltration,  website  defacement,  private  and  public  web  browser  

          exploits, instant messaging and social media abuse, and intellectual property  

          theft.   

            
            
2.2.6     Economic Impact of Cybercrime  

            
          •    Recently,  a  total  of  $388billion  USD  was  estimated  as  the  approximate  

               total financial loss to cybercrime in more 24 countries in the last six years.  

          •    The  global  black  market  in  marijuana,  cocaine  and  heroin  combined  

               ($288bn) and approaching the value of all global drug trafficking ($411bn).  

          •    At $388bn, cybercrime is more than 100 times the annual expenditure of

2.2.7   Cyber threat landscape is diverse and diffusely driven by state and non-state  
actors.  

          State Actor:   

          The  State  Actors  are  established  and  well  organised  to  carry  out  the  most  
          sophisticated threat in the cyberspace with the goal of exploiting computers  
          and   information   and   communication   networks   to   gather   intelligence   on  
          government, military, industrial and economic targets, and opponents of their  
          Regimes. They gathered intelligence data and information which can be used  
          for  spreading  falsehood  and  disrupting  critical  services.  Sometimes  they  
          install  hidden  malicious  software  on  a  system  can  be  adapted  to  suit  an  
          attacker’s changing objectives, lying hidden within the system in readiness for  
          exploitation during times of increased tension or conflict.  

          Non State Actors:   
            
          Organized   and   unorganized   criminals   operating   in   the   underground  
          economy   exploiting   weakness   in   individual,   corporate   and   government  
          systems  and  information  infrastructure.  They  used  different  technology  and  
          psychology  method  to  manipulate  users  and  engage  highly  sophisticated  
          cyber tools to infect, hijack, control and extract value information for criminal  
          purpose.  Financial motivation is usually the driven force of this particular non- 
          state  actor.  They  inflict  huge  financial  damage  on  their  victims.  Their  action  
          damage country reputation and inflict huge collateral damage on the country  
          financial system.   
            
          Terrorists  and  extremist  engage  resources  of  cyberspace  to  perpetuate  
          against         the      government;             falsehood,          communication,              recruitment,  
          indoctrination, raising of fund activists and distribution of extremist contents.  
          They  are  active  attackers  and  constitute  one  of  the  major  threat  to  national  
          security.

         established  authorities.  They  operate  through  social  media  and  vulnerable  
         backdoors, usually connecting with an insider with passive attack tendency.   
  

2.2.8   The National Cybersecurity Policy document has identified and classified five  

         (5)  major  cyber  threats  as  inimical  to  the  national  security  strategy.  These

         integrity of the country’s economy.   

           

2.2.9   The  underlying  ideology  of  this  National  Cybersecurity  Strategy  is  to  proffer  

         relevant  strategic  frameworks  and  mechanisms  for  addressing  these  cyber- 

         threats, securing the nation in the advent of cyber-attack, while preparing the

2.3    Imperative of a National Vulnerability Assessment   
         

2.3.1   Vulnerability is the structural weaknesses of the nation’s information systems  

         and  critical  information  infrastructure  ranging  from  technical  flaws,  porous  

         measures, to human negligence.  

2.3.2   The  NCSS  requires  that  national  vulnerability  assessment  be  conducted  

         towards       determining       weaknesses          in   government         information       systems,  

         websites, networks, data handling processes and vulnerabilities existing in the  

         nation’s critical information infrastructure.   

2.3.3   The  national  vulnerability  assessment  helps  the  government  appreciate  the  

         level  of  her  unpreparedness,  the  need  to  safeguard  huge  investments  in  

         information systems and communication infrastructure and commitment made  

         to global partners National ICT developmental goals.   

2.3.4   There  are  efforts  aimed  at  addressing  some  of  these  challenges  at  the  

         sectorial  levels. However, NCSS is laying a foundation for the coordination of  

         the country cyber-ecosystem with a unified framework on cybersecurity.

2.3.5   The ultimate goal is to build a collective counter-measures mechanisms that  

         will facilitate the country’s capability in addressing the huge vulnerability gaps  

         among the states information systems, critical information infrastructure, and  

          protection of our presence in cyberspace.  

  

2.4    Gauging the Impacts and Opportunities  

2.4.1   There  are  many  advantages  associated  with  the  implementation  of  the  

          national Cybersecurity strategy. Building and nurturing trust and confidence in  

         the    use     of   national      information       systems       and    critical    information       and  

         communication technology is crucial to the socio-economic well-being of the  

         citizenry, therefore it is important to secure our nation in cyberspace thereby  

          infusing high level of confidence and trust in the nation digital economy.

                                        CHAPTER THREE  

                           NATIONAL READINESS STRATEGY  

  

3.1      National Cybersecurity Policy Direction  

3.1.1   The   National   Cybersecurity   Strategy   defines   the   nation’s   readiness   to  

         safeguard  and  prepare  the  whole  Nation  in  advance  for  global  economic  

         competitiveness in cyberspace.  It also addresses willingness to empower the  

         nation  in  building  a  comprehensive,  coherent,  structural  and  procedural  

         capabilities at strategic and tactical levels in mitigating cyber risks.   

3.1.2   The   strategy   involves   engagement   of   government   and   non-government  

         actors,  employing  multi-stakeholder’s  principles  of  approach,  inclusive  of  all  

         participatory       and      partnerships        of    government,         industry      and     other  

         stakeholders.  

3.1.3   The critical success factor of NCSS is hinged on comprehensive mobilization,  

         engagement  and  coordination  of  critical  components  towards  securing  our  

         presence in cyberspace and protecting critical information infrastructures.  

3.1.4   The  direction  of  the  policy  of  government  on  cybersecurity  is  in  agreement  

         with regional and global direction on securing cyberspace.   

3.1.5 The paramount focus of the cybersecurity strategy is addressing our cyber risk  

         exposure,       protection      of   our    national     critical   information       infrastructure,  

         exploiting cyberspace opportunities for national security and economic goals,  

         and  the  enthronement  of  a  trusted  cyber  community  remain  a  paramount  

         focus of the National Cybersecurity Strategy.     

           

3.2.     Necessity of a National Cybersecurity Strategy  

  

3.2.1   The  multi-dimensional  nature  of  the  evolving  security  threats  is  moving  the  

         current National Security Strategy beyond the traditional scope.   

  

	 

----------------------- Page 22-----------------------

3.2.2   The  nature  of  the  current  security  threats  such  as  cybercrime,  violence,  

           conflict  and  terrorism  increasingly  exploits  the  openness  and  borderless  

           nature of cyberspace. This constitutes a threat to our growing dependence on  

           cyberspace.    

  

3.2.3   Government  is  leading  a  coherent  national  response  towards  reducing  the  

           impact  and  escalation  of  cyber  threats  in  a  manner  that  safeguards  the  

           nation’s  presence  and  guarantee  trust  and  confidence  in  our  connected  

           economy.   

  

3.3.       Objectives of National Cybersecurity Strategy   
  
3.3.1   The Strategy aims are to set out a national roadmap with various coordinated  

           mechanisms;   harness   implementation   framework;   and   actions   that   will  

           guarantee         attainment          of    the     National        vision,      mission        and      goals      on  

           Cybersecurity as captured in the National Cybersecurity Policy.   

            

3.3.2   Therefore, the Strategy is needed to achieve the following specific objectives:  

                  

         i.     A    comprehensive              cybercrime           legislation        and      cyber-threat          counter  

                measures that are nationally adoptable, regionally and globally relevant in  

                the context of securing   the nation’s cyberspace.   

                  

        ii.     Provision  of  measures  that  protect  critical  information  infrastructure,  as  

                well     as    reducing         our     national       vulnerabilities         through        cybersecurity  

                assurance framework.    

  

       iii.     To articulate an effective computer emergency response capability.  

      

       iv.      National   mechanisms   on   capacity   building,   public   awareness,   skills  

                empowerment  is  necessary  to  help  strengthen  our  capability  so  as  to  

                respond promptly and effectively to cyber-attacks.

       v.      A    trusted      mechanism          for    engaging        national       multi-stakeholder           and  

               international partners towards collectively addressing cyber threats.  

       vi.     To deter and protect government from all forms of cyber-attacks.   
                     
      vii.     To coordinate cybersecurity initiatives at all levels of government in the  
               country.  
                     
     viii.     To build national capabilities against cyber threats with coherent  
               cooperation through public- private sector partnership and multi- 
               stakeholder engagement.  
      
       ix.     To promote national vision on cybersecurity through awareness,  
               partnership through shared responsibilities and a trusted community of  
               stakeholders.  
      
       x.      To  promote  coordination,  cooperation  and  collaboration  of  regional  and  
               global stakeholders on cybersecurity.  
  
3.3.2   The  Strategy  is  further  aligned  with  National  Security  Strategy  and  other  
          relevant  government  documents  most  especially  National  ICT  policy  and  
          National broadband plan.  
  
3.3.3   The  Strategy  defines  the  basis  for  a  coordinated  national  and  globally  
          compatible  framework  for  action,  cooperation  and  approach  to  protecting  
          national critical information infrastructure against cyber threats.   
  
                 
  
3.4       Scope of National Cybersecurity Strategy  
            
          The scope of the national cybersecurity strategy covers the areas of national  
          priorities as well as general framework for partnership and international multi- 
          stakeholder cooperation on cybersecurity.                             
  
3.5       Approach, Guiding Principles & National Priorities    
             
          The  NCSS  approach  involves  coordination  of  the  nation’s  cybersecurity  
          constituents  and  public-private  partnership  which  are  consistent  with  the  
          objectives   and   the   guiding   principles   as   encapsulated   in   the   National  
          Cybersecurity Policy.  
  
3.6       Governance Strategy   
            
3.6.1   The  implementation  of  the  provision  of  the  strategy  will  be  coordinated  
          through  the  Office  of  National  Security  Adviser  in  collaboration  with  other  
          relevant government agencies.   
  

	 

----------------------- Page 24-----------------------

3.6.2   The   central   coordination   model   will   operate   in   synergy   with   federated  
         structures toward achieving comprehensive measures on cybersecurity.  
  
3.6.3    Central coordination model is adopted in line with international best practices  
         and     has    recommended           in   the    global     framework       for   cooperation        on  
         cybersecurity  
  
3.6.4   The  sustainability  and  critical  success  factor  of  this  governance  model  is  
         anchored on public-private sector partnership, multi-stakeholder engagement  
         as well as regional and international cooperation.

                               LEGAL FRAMEWORK INITIATIVES  
  
  
4.1 Objective  

  

4.1.1   The  objective  of  the  Cyber  Security  Legal  Framework  is  to  identify  the  

          strategy  required  to  ensure  areas  defined  in  the  Cyber  security  Policy  are  

          implemented,  managed,  sustained  and  effective  in  combating  cybercrime  in  

          Nigeria.   

            

4.1.2   To achieve this aim, a number of immediate and long term legal framework  

          initiatives  will  need  to  be  developed,  agreed,  funded  and  rolled  out  to  

          accomplish success.  

  

4.2       Approach  

  

     •    The approach takes the form of referencing aspects of the Legal Framework  

          in the cyber security policy  with a view to prescribing the initiatives that will  

          allow for the implementation of each of the detailed areas.

4.3 Initiatives:  

  

4.3.1     Initiave1: Enacting Fit for Purpose Cybercrime Legislation  

  

	 

----------------------- Page 26-----------------------

     •   As prescribed in the cyber security policy, fit for purpose legislation will need  

         to be enacted and implemented to combat cybercrime.   

           

     •   The main focus of this initiative will entail a root and branch review of Nigeria’s  

         current and draft cybercrime legislations.   

           

     •   The  objective    of  this  exercise  will  be  to  identify  any  gaps  between  what  is  

         currently available and what has been proposed in the Cyber security  policy  

         with  a  view  to  updating  any  omissions  or  redundancies  so  that  when  the  

          legislation is enacted  , it will be adequately  effective , workable and flexible  

         enough to deter and prosecute cybercrime activities  

           

     •   This initiative supports a strategy to enact a number of separate and distinct  

          legislations that will make up the cybercrime legislative framework as opposed  

         to a single legislation that has the banner of cybercrime legislation.   

           

     •   To the barest  minimum, the following legislations will need to be included in  

         the  new  cybercrime  framework:  Anti-Spam,  Child  Online  Protection,  Child  

          Pornography,  Cookies,  Computer  Misuse,  Cyber  Blackmail,  Cyber  bullying  

         and  Harassment,  Cyber  Espionage,  Cyber  Terrorism,  Digital  Evidence  and  

          Preservation,  Data  Protection,  Data  Retention,  Hacktivism;  Identity  Theft,  

          Information  Security,  Intellectual  Property  Rights,  Lawful  Interception,  Online  

          Fraud,  Privacy,  tribalism  and  Xenophobia,  Software  Piracy,  Security  Breach  

          Notifications, Unauthorized System Interference etc.  

  

     •   Aligned to the review and enactment of the cybercrime legislative framework  

          is the need to put in place measures to keep the laws up to date and effective.  

           

     •   The strategy to achieve this will include the establishment of a Cyber Crime  

          Legislative Review Committee (CCLRC) whose purview will be to advise the  

          National  Security  Advisor,  Legislature  and  regulatory  bodies  on  aspects  of  

          legislations  that  needs  to  be  amended  to  ensure  current  legislations  do  not  

          become redundant, unenforceable and ineffective.  

	 

----------------------- Page 27-----------------------

     •    This  is  an  immediate  initiative  and  needs  to  be  given  special  priority  as  it  

          forms  the  bedrock  of  the  applicability,  enforceability  and  prosecution  of  

          individuals and organisations that breach key segments of the National Cyber  

          Security policy.  

  

  

4.3.2   Initiative 2.   
  
          Preparing and Revamping the Judiciary for Cybercrime Legislations  
  
     •    Nigeria’s  current  judicial  environment  is  not  adequately  equipped  to  handle  
          sophisticated  cybercrime  cases.  In  order  to  ensure  the  new  cybercrime  
          legislations are effective in the prosecution of alleged cybercrimes, when they  
          are brought before the courts,  it is the strategic objective of NCSS to ensure  
          the Nigerian Court system is equipped to handle cybercrime cases.   
  
     •    In fulfilling this strategy, the following initiatives will be undertaken  
  
          a)  Capacity building for Judges and lawyers on the new cybercrime laws  
          b)  Courts will be equipped to handle digital forensic evidence  
          c)   Provide law enforcement agencies with the processes and procedures for  
               investigating cybercrime activities.  
          d)  Capacity  building  for  law  enforcement  and  security  agencies  on  digital  
               forensic capability.  
  
     •    This  will  be  achieved  by  developing  a  home  grown  fit  for  purpose  certified  
          programme  of  training  courses,  capacity  building,  awareness  programmes  
          and materials for current Nigerian judges and lawyers.  
            
     •    The  strategy  will  also  include  the  incision  of  new  cybercrime  legislation  
          courses in institutes of higher learning so that newly qualified lawyers have a  
          basic understanding of Nigeria’s cybercrime framework.  
  
     •    This will be a long term and on-going initiative.  
  
  
4.3.3     Initiative 3: International Co-operation  
  
     •    To ensure our cybercrime laws are effective and internationally harmonised,  
          the legal strategy is to adopt the provisions of the convention on cybercrime to  
          enable effective cross border law enforcement.  

	 

----------------------- Page 28-----------------------

     •    This will allow for the following:   
            
             I.     International harmonisation of our legislations  
            II.     Collation of all existing conventions and bilateral agreements  
            III.    International cooperation to combat cybercrime  
           IV.       wider investigatory capability  
            V.       Capacity Building and knowledge sharing  
           VI.      Opportunity  for  Nigeria  to  make  a  contribution  to  how  cyberspace  is  
                    governed through international instruments of law.  
            
          International co-operation will also include becoming a member of recognised  
          bodies such as:  
            
               •    The International Telecommunications Union (ITU)  
               •    Cybercrime Convention  
               •    Interpol  
            
          It is envisaged that the processes to engage with international bodies will start  
          to be defined with the objective of implementing and achieving within the next  
          12 months.  
            
          This is an immediate initiative  
  
  
4.3.4     Initiative 4: Public/Private Sector Collaboration  
  
     •    Recognizing  that  cybercrime  can  impact  both  private  and  public  sector  
          environments,  the  legal  strategy  is  to  adopt  processes  for  both  public  and  
          private sector collaboration in combating cybercrime.   
            
     •    As  an  example  relationships  between  Communication  Service  Providers  in  
          assisting  law  enforcement  agencies  in  preserving  communications  data  for  
          specified  periods  as  dictated  by  the  Data  Retention  legislations  will  be  
          encouraged and forged.   
            
            
     •    This will also extend to financial institutions in ensuring they retain customer  
          records according to specified time lines.  
  
     •    The strategy will also entail providing specific guidelines on how to meet these  
          requirements.  
  

	 

----------------------- Page 29-----------------------

     •    A key part of the public/private sector collaborative strategy will be to put in  
          place  measures  to  reduce  reliance  on  foreign  controlled  networks  to  store  
          personal information of Nigeria Citizens.   
            
     •    This will have the impact of reducing the risk footprint as well as the potential  
          for such data to be compromised and used to the detriment of Nigerians  
  
     •    This is an immediate and ongoing initiative  
  
4.3.5     Initiative 5: Raising Awareness  
  
     •    While  implementing  cybercrime  legislations  are  paramount  in  combating  
          cybercrime,  it  is  to  be  noted  that  making  citizens  aware  of  the  threats  and  
          vulnerabilities  that  can  accrue  to  them  when  they  use  the  internet,  is  a  
          measure that can be used to reduce the likelihood of them being victims of  
          cybercrime.  
            
     •    Raising  awareness  of  the  new  laws  through  high  profile  campaigns  is  an  
          initiative  that  will  be  used  to  make  criminals  aware  of  the  consequences  of  
          being in breach of these legislations once they are enacted.  
  
     •    It  is  also  part  of  the  strategy  to  socialise  these  new  laws  to  the  wider  
          international community.  
  
     •    This is an immediate initiative  
  
4.4       Special Areas of Focus:   
  
4.4.1   Data Protection, Privacy and Lawful Interception.  
  
     •    Personal        Information        has      economic         and     political     value.      The      recent  
          identification  of  Nigeria  as  a  MINT  (i.e.  Malaysia,  Indonesia,  Nigeria  and  
          Turkey) country not only raises its profile in monetary and economic terms, it  
          also raises the risk of infrastructure and systems containing Nigerian citizens  
          data  being  targeted  by  unscrupulous  individuals,  organisations  and  nation  
          states,  leading  to  data  loss,  leakage  as  well  as  confidentiality,  integrity  and  
          availability compromise.  
            
     •    The  recent  revelations  of  American  whistle-blower  Edward  Snowden  has  
          significantly   raised   awareness   of   the   need   for   nations   to   put   in   place  
          appropriate measures to protect the personal information, and privacy of its  
          citizens.  
  

	 

----------------------- Page 30-----------------------

      •    The revelations also identified the need to protect and secure communications  
           of not only high ranking government and high profile individuals from mobile  
           phone tapping but also ordinary individuals from their everyday non-criminal  
           conversations being intercepted and analysed by law enforcement agencies,  
           organisations and foreign countries.  
  
      •    To protect and legislate for criminal activities against Nigerian Citizens data  
           and their communications special emphasis will  be given to the development  
           and roll out of Data Protection and Privacy laws in Nigeria.  
  
  
  

                                                                                                                                      
                                            NCSS Fig 3   Data Protection and Privacy  
  
      •    The objective of this initiative will be to ensure individuals and organisations  

           are  aware  of  their  responsibilities  when  handling  and  processing  personal  

           information.   

             

      •    It will also allow them to be aware of what constitutes unacceptable and illegal  

           behaviour  in  relation  to  the  use  of  such  information  and  communication  

           streams.  

  

      •    The legislative, technical and policy initiatives to fulfil this aim will consist of

                                                      CHAPTER FIVE  
                                                       
                                                                     
               NATIONAL INCIDENT MANAGEMENT STRATEGY  
5.1        Purpose:  
  
5.1.1   The  strategy  on  incident  management  is  designed  to  effectively  deter  and  

           respond  to  cyber  threats  and  cybercrime  that  will  leverage  on  an  efficient  

           emergency readiness and coordination capability.   

5.1.2   The strategy will also facilitate, promote and strengthen national commitments  

           to regional and global partnerships and cooperation on cybersecurity.  

  

5.2        Establishing National CERT:   

  

5.2.1   The Nigerian Computer Emergency Team (ngCERT) shall be established to  

           ensure efficient response to security incidents within our cyberspace.  

             

5.2.2   An effective computer emergency response capability is essential to monitor  

           and deter threats that can exploit information system vulnerabilities.   

             

5.2.3   The  Nigerian  Computer  Emergency  Readiness  Team  (ngCERT)  will  be  

           empowered             by     a    legal      framework           through        which       its    functions         and  

           responsibilities are defined.  

             

	 

----------------------- Page 34-----------------------

5.2.4     However,  where  existing  laws  are  inadequate,  a  review  or  new  legislative  

          processes   should   commence   to   address   legal   vacuum   that   will   hinder  

          operations of the national CERT.  

  

5.2.5   The  harmonized  laws  should  clearly  mandate  it  to  function  as  of  one  the  

          strategic  components  of  the  central  coordinating  center  for  all  computer  

          security  incident  management  within  our  national  cyberspace.  Additionally,  

          incident classification will be the sole role of the Cyber Emergency Monitoring  

          System (CEMS) administered and managed by ngCERT.   

            

5.2.6   Additionally,   incident   classification   will   be   the   sole   role   of   the   Cyber  

          Emergency   Monitoring   System   (CEMS)   administered   and   managed   by  

          ngCERT.   

  
5.3        Implementation Approach  
  

5.3.1   A  National  Incident  Response  Plan  (NIRP)  will  be  formulated  to  achieve  a  

          coordinated  emergency  response  protocols.  It  will  govern  both  the  national  

          and sectorial CERTs  

            

5.3.2   The  plan  will  set  out  clear  definitions  and  procedures  for  incident  response  

          that will focus on incident classification and its severance.   

            

5.3.3     In addition, incident classification will be the sole role of the Cyber Emergency  

          Monitoring System (CEMS) administered and managed by ngCERT.  

5.3.4   CEMS  will  classify  threats  that  constitute  a  national-level  cyber  incident  

          requiring   ngCERT   involvement   and   the   triggering   of   incident   response  

          protocols.   

            

5.4       Initiative 1:  Preventive Strategy  

5.4.1   All key national information infrastructures shall have a preventive mechanism  

          for network monitoring system integrated into CEMS.  

	 

----------------------- Page 35-----------------------

      5.4.2    The preventive strategy will primarily be implemented by CEMS for analysis  

               and detection as well as alert notification.   

      5.4.3   CEMS operational procedure will define the baseline security monitoring for  

               broad   detection   of   malicious   or   anomalous   network   activity   within   our  

               cyberspace and specify specialized security monitoring for critical assets and  

               critical  processes  within  the  context  of  the  National  Critical  Information  

               Infrastructure Protection Plan (NCIIPP).  

        

        

      5.5   Initiative 2: Detection Strategy  

      5.5.1   The  Cyber  Emergency  Monitoring  System  (CEMS)  will  serve  as  the  main                      

               provider of data   analysis and reporting to other key detection and response  

               partners across the incident management ecosystem.  

                 
      5.5.2    Its  key  focus  is  to  consistently  monitor  indicators  within  the  nation’s  cyber  

               space  in  order  to  detect  potential  threats  and  classify  them  according  to  its  

               severance level determined. This can serve as an alert to the trigger the next  

               chain of activity in the response protocols.  

                 
      5.6      Initiative 3 Response Strategy:  

      5.6.1   After   an   incident   is   detected   and   validated   by   the   CEMS,   direct   and    

               coordinated action will be implemented immediately to ensure that appropriate  

               actions  to  stop  an  on-going  incident  occur  at  the  right  time  on  the  right  

               cybersecurity priorities.   

       5.6.2   The action plan will require identifying the scope and scale of the incident in  

                order  to  activate  the  relevant  countermeasures  procedures  as  outlined  in  

                NIRP to mitigate damages.  

                    Investigating  cybercrime  incident  requires  a  strict  evidence  preservation  

               procedures         showing        appropriate        evidence         handling       procedure         and  

      	 

----------------------- Page 36-----------------------

         established chain of custody.   

         Therefore, it is necessary for incident handlers to take appropriated measures  

         in  order  to  preserve  any  artefacts  that  could  be  of  evidential  value  by  

         recording,  reviewing  and  resolving  security  incidents  with  the  established  

         incident management processes as define in the NIRP. Additionally, ngCERT  

         is expected to document all such report as will be required to be submitted by  

         all  monitored  information  infrastructure  custodians  in  order  to  evaluate  the  

         effectiveness of response plan through lessons learned.  

  

 5.7  Cooperation and Partnership  

 5.7.2   The  ngCERT  under  the  framework  of  National  Cybersecurity  Coordinating  

          Center  will  coordinate  activities  of  other  sectorial  CERT  and  facilitates  

          cooperation  and  partnership  of  all  cybersecurity  stakeholders,  including  

          international and multilateral organizations.   

            

 5.7.3     It is imperative to note that, sharing of action noteworthy information about  

          new threats and vulnerabilities with partners by ngCERT  will avail them the  

          security status of the national cyberspace and the need to protect it  

           

 5.7.4    NgCERT also will enable both government and private sector actors through  

          stimulated exercises to support stakeholders understand their roles during a  

          crisis  and  better  prepare  for  incident  response  scenarios.  This  will  test  

          incident   response   capabilities   and   processes   created   to   communicate,  

          collaborate, and restore services in the event of an incident.  

 5.8   Capacity Building  

 5.8.2   To sustain an optimal incident response readiness capability, technical and  

          procedural  capacity  building  will  be  instituted  for  both  law  enforcement  as  

          well as judicial officers to build their expertise and facilitate understanding of  

          the dynamics of cybercrime.   

	 

----------------------- Page 37-----------------------

  5.8.3   Training will focus on methods of handling digital evidence to ensure that it  

            preserves its evidential weight and thus admissibility in Court.

                        STRATEGY ON CRITICAL INFORMATION  
               INFRASTRUCTURES PROTECTION & RESILIENCE  
                                                             
  
6.1       Introduction   

6.1.1   This  Strategy  articulates  the  various  Critical  Information  Infrastructure  (CII)  

          protection and  resilience activities the Government undertakes, ranging from  

          how  it  engages  with  business,  government  (international  and  domestic)  as  

         well as other stakeholders.  

6.1.2   This  Strategy  presents  the  Government’s  approach  to  Critical  Information  

          Infrastructure Protection and Resilience (CIIPR).  

           

6.1.3     It   also    acknowledges           that     CIIPR      is   a    shared       responsibility       across  

          governments, the owners and operators of critical infrastructure.  

  

  

6.2      Vision of CIIPR  

          •   To  ensure  continued  operation  of  CII  in  the  face  of  all  hazards,  as  this  

              critical    infrastructure        supports       national      defense       and     security,      and  

              underpins our economic prosperity and social wellbeing.

6.3       Mission of CIIPR  

          •   To  harness  all  relevant  stakeholder’s  CIIPR  Programs  into  a  national  

              holistic agenda capable of supporting the country’s national security and  

              ensure provision of essential services.  

                

6.4       Strategic Objectives  

             i.    Assess  threats  to,  vulnerabilities  of,  and  consequences  to  critical  

                   infrastructure        through        an     intelligent      and      information-led,         risk  

                   management approach.  

            ii.    Secure   CII   against   physical,   human   and   cyber   threats   through  

                   sustainable efforts to reduce risk.  

            

           iii.    Enhance        CII    resilience      by    reducing       impact      of    unforeseen        and  

                   unexpected incidents through  advance planning and mitigation efforts,  

                   as  well  as  effective  responses  aimed  at    saving  lives  and  ensuring   

                   rapid recovery of essential services;   

            

           iv.      Share      relevant      information       across      the     CII   community         to    build  

                   awareness  and  enable  a  coordinated  risk-  informed  decision  making,  

                   while  promoting  a  learning  and  adaptation  during  and  after  exercises  

                   and incidents impacting on CII.   

                     

            v.     These  objectives  will  be  supported  by  regular  developments  of  more  

                   specific  priorities  by  key  critical  infrastructure  partnerships  related  to  

                   risk management and capability enhancement.  

                     

           vi.     Based  on  the  vision,  mission,  and  goals,  the  critical  infrastructure  

                   community will work together to set specific national priorities. National  

                   priorities will be set considering resource availability, progress already  

                   made,  known  capability  gaps,  and  emerging  trends  and  risks  in  

                   cybersecurity.   

                     

	 

----------------------- Page 40-----------------------

          vii.     National  priorities  will  drive  implementation  and  will  be  supplemented  

                   by sector, regional, and corporate priorities. Performance measures will  

                   be  set  based  on  the  goals  and  priorities  of  each  sector,  regional  or  

                   national Government.   

                     

          viii.    The National Annual Preparedness Report will include measurements  

                   of progress that will help derive a common understanding of the state  

                   of critical infrastructure security and resilient efforts.  

            
                     

6.5       STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES TO ACHIEVE AIMS AND OBJECTIVES  

6.5.1   The Government recognizes the importance of critical infrastructure, including  

          those parts that provide essential services for everyday life (such as energy,  

          food,  water,  transport,  communications,  health  and  banking  and  finance).  A  

          disruption to critical infrastructure could have a range of serious implications  

          for business, governments and our social wellbeing.  

  

6.6       Initiative 1: Operate an effective business-government  partnership with     

          critical infrastructure owners and operators.  

               •   A significant proportion of the nation’s critical infrastructure is privately  

                   owned or operated on a commercial basis.   

                     

               •   A  business-government  partnership  will  be  established  to  help  build  

                   confidence   and   reliability   for   the   continued   operation   of   critical  

                   infrastructure that supports national security, economic prosperity, and  

                   social and community wellbeing.   

                     

               •   It  is  important  that  the  business-government  partnership  offers  value  

                   and mutual benefit to the parties involved.

6.6.1   Necessity  for  Trust  Information  Sharing  Network  (TISN)  Activity  for  

          NCIIPP  

  

               •   There will be need for the establishment of a TISN for National Critical  

                   Information Infrastructure Protection Plan (NCIIPP).  

                     

               •   This network will comprise of relevant private sector and government  

                   representatives,  to  raise  the  awareness  of  risks  to  critical  information  

                   infrastructure, share information and techniques required to assess and  

                   mitigate  risks,  and  build  resilience  capacity  within  entities  in  the  

                   network.   

               •   Working  with  the  TISN,  the  private  sector  is  able  to  bring  issues  to  

                   government   that   are   seen   as   impediments   to   achieving   critical  

                   information infrastructure protect.   

                     

               •   The  TISN  will  be  the  most  visible  component  of  the  public-private  

                   partnership   and   will   provide   an   important   mechanism   to   foster  

                   cooperation between public- private stakeholders on mutually important  

                   issues.  

                     

               •   The   TISN   will   raise   awareness   on   critical   infrastructure   issues,  

                   including       potential      impediments          to    achieving       CIP.     Government  

                   agencies   directly   involved   in   CIP   are   able   to   better   represent  

                   stakeholder interests in the various machineries of government that are  

                   used to develop and implement Government policy and act as critical  

                   infrastructure advocates in the broader policy debate.   

            

               •   Accordingly,  Government  agencies  that  have  a  role  in  implementing  

                   the  CIP  Strategy  are  able  to  influence  or  shape  government  policy  

                   initiatives that have impact on critical infrastructure organizations and  

                   their ability to achieve CIP.

6.6.2   Trusted Information Sharing Network Initiative (TISN)  

          •   The TISN will be established in the Office of the National Security Adviser  

              as  an  exclusive  forum  in  which  the  owners  and  operators  of  critical  

              infrastructure  work  come  together  and  share  information  on  threats  and  

              vulnerabilities as well as develop strategies and solutions to mitigate risk  

              to the nation’s CII.   

                

          •   TISN  members  include  owners  and  operators  of  critical  infrastructure,  

              Federal,  State  and  local  government  agency  representatives  as  well  as  

              departments and agencies of government.   

          •   The  TISN,  through  its  Sector  and  Expert  Advisory  Groups,  will  promote  

              infrastructure protection to owners and operators as well as promote the  

              need for investment in resilient and reliable infrastructure.  

  

6.6.3   Sector Groups  

              •    Sector Groups form the bridge between government and the individual  

                   owners and operators of Nigeria’s critical infrastructure.   

                     

              •    Their purpose is to assist owners and operators to share information on  

                   issues   relating   to   generic   threats,   vulnerabilities   and   to   identify  

                   appropriate measures and strategies to mitigate risk.   

  

6.6.4   Sector Specific Plans  

          •   There  will  be  sector  specific  plans  for  each  sector  which  will  highlight  

              sector  level  performance  objectives  and  feedback  to  the  coordinating  

              agency  of  government  charged  with  the  responsibility  of  managing  the  

              sector.   

                

          •   For  example,  the  sector  specific  plan  for  the  Information  Technology  

              Sector will be coordinated and managed by the Ministry of Information and  

              Communication   Technology.   In   collaboration   with   other   stakeholders

6.7.2     Evaluation  

          •    After  the  identification  of  potential  critical  components  of  information  

               infrastructure, there will be the need for the evaluation to understand the  

               mode of operation and estimate its risk levels and criticality.   

                 

          •    The evaluation process relies on the cooperation of infrastructure owners  

               and   operators.   Having   an   understanding   of   the   estimated   risk   and  

               criticality  levels  is  important  for  the  government.  However,  this  does  not  

               replace  the  owner’s  responsibility  to  develop  a  robust  risk  management  

               program to safeguard their assets from known and unknown threats.

               adopt best practices in their approach to planning and preparedness. This  

               will  ensure  a  structured,  logical  and  rigorous  approach  on  the  most  

               appropriate  steps  to  take  in  order  to  prevent,  detect,  react  and  recover

6.9    Initiative 4:  Identify, analyse and manage cross-sectorial dependencies  

             

      •    The identification and analysis of cross-sectorial dependencies assists the risk  

            management decision making of critical infrastructure organizations and helps  

           to inform the Government’s policy on CIP.   

             

      •     Critical  infrastructure  by  nature  are  highly  interdependent,  so  that  failure  or  

            disruption in one sector can lead to disruptions in other sectors. For instance,  

            owners  and  operators  of  water  infrastructure  rely  on  electricity  for  pumping  

            and        telecommunications                    for       monitoring            operations.             Similarly,           the  

            communications  industry  needs  electricity  to  run  their  networks,  and  the  

            electricity  industry  needs  telemetry  services  to  run  their  operations  and  

            electricity marketing.   

             

	 

----------------------- Page 47-----------------------

     •   A cross-sectorial analysis of dependencies will assist owners and operators of  

          critical infrastructure and the Nigerian Government to understand system-wide  

          risks that are beyond the purview of individual organizations or sectors.   

           

     •    This increases the potential for a more effective sharing of risk to cope with  

          certain   incidents.   The   Critical   Infrastructure   Program   for   Modelling   and  

         Analysis (CIPMA) is proposed as a key initiative of the Nigerian Government’s  

          efforts  to  enhance  the  protection  and  resilience  of  critical  infrastructure  in  

          Nigeria.  

6.9.1   The Critical Infrastructure Program for Modelling and Analysis (CIPMA)  

     •    CIPMA is a computer-based capability, which uses a vast array of data and  

          information  from  a  range  of  sources  (including  the  owners  and  operators  of  

          critical  infrastructure)  to  model  and  simulate  the  behavior  and  dependency  

          relationships of critical infrastructure systems.  

           

     •    CIPMA  uses  an  all  hazards  approach  to  undertake  computer  modelling  to  

          determine  the  consequences  of  different  disasters  and  threats  (human  and  

          natural) to critical infrastructure.   

           

     •    Owners  and  operators  of  critical  infrastructure  can  use  this  information  to  

          prevent, prepare for, respond to or recover from a natural or human-caused  

          hazard.   

           

     •    CIPMA also helps government shape policies on national security and critical  

          infrastructure resilience.  

           

     •    CIPMA   is   an   important   capability   to   support   the   business-government  

          partnership, and relies on strong support from stakeholders such as owners  

          and operators of critical infrastructure, Federal, State and local governments,  

          and government agencies for its ongoing development.   

           

	 

----------------------- Page 48-----------------------

     •    Importantly,  CIPMA  can  show  the  relationships  and  dependencies  between  

          critical infrastructure systems, and the cascade impacts from a failure in one  

          sector on the operations of critical infrastructure in other sectors.  

            

     •    NCIPP   unit   manages   CIPMA   and   works   with   ONSA-NCCC   and   other  

          technical  service  providers  to  further  develop  and  deliver  this  whole-of-

6.10 Success Criteria And Review Of CIIP Strategy  

     •    Critical  infrastructure  protection  and  resilience  is  an  ongoing  process  that  

          requires periodic review and fine tuning of the activities under each strategic  

          imperative will be required as the strategy is implemented.  

6.10.1 Mechanism for Measuring Success:  

          Success will be measured through following mechanisms:  

          •    Effective Critical Information Infrastructure Protection is reliant on a strong,  

               collaborative  partnership  between  governments  and  critical  infrastructure  

               owners  and  operators  to  deliver  the  Government’s  policy  aim  of  the  

               continued operation of critical infrastructure in the face of all cyber threats.  

                 

          •    Need  for  investment  in  resilient,  robust  infrastructure  (e.g  CIPMA)  to  

               identify  key  cross-sectorial  dependencies  and  vulnerabilities  with  respect  

               to both cyber and physical infrastructure.  

                 

          •    Businesses and governments collaborating to progress national research  

               and submission of curriculum inputs to training and research on CIP  

                 

          •    Periodic lessons from incident report and reaction exercise activities and  

               real life events propagated to all Sector Groups to enhance organization’s

7.1.1   There is a need to address the issues of cyber threats from risks management  

         and  process  governance  approaches  because  of  the  need  to  address  the  

         nation's internal vulnerability and other weakest link.  

7.1.2   The  development  of  a  National  Cybersecurity  Strategy  designed  to  address  

         these issues however, is only as good as the National Cybersecurity program  

         that implements it.   

7.1.3   The continuous monitoring and review (i.e. assessment and evaluation) of the  

         implementation and management of the National Cybersecurity Program, and  

         the  surrounding  context  that  it  operates  within,  will  be  critical  in  providing  

         assurance to various stakeholders that the National Cybersecurity program is  

         well able, and continually so, to safeguard our vulnerability and other critical  

         national infrastructure.

8.5		      Roadmap	for	Nigeria	Cybersecurity	Industry:	 
	 
8.5.1	     In	 Nigeria,	 cybersecurity	 essential	 skills	 at	 the	 public	 institutions	 and	 industry	 
           level	engagement	are	scarce.	The	scarcely	available	ones	are	extremely	limited	in	 
           their	scope	and	capabilities	to	safeguard	and	protect	critical	industries.	Various	 
           genuine	concerns	have	been	expressed	on	the	apparently	incapacity	of	Nigeria	as	 
           a	nation	to	protect	itself	and	her	industry	in	the	face	of	a	major	attacks	on	her	 
           Critical	Information	and	Related	Infrastructures.	 
	 
8.5.2	     Stakeholders	         from	  Industries,	  law	  enforcement	  agencies,	  academics,	  non- 
           governmental	 organizations,	 government	 Ministries,	 Department	 and	 Agencies,	 
           Nigeria	 Professionals	 in	 diasporas	 should	 emerge	 together	 under	 a	 proposed	 
           framework	for	cybersecurity	profession	umbrella	body	to	help	the	country	drive	 
           common	 professional	 synergy	 on	 cybersecurity	 instrument	 of	 research	 and	 
           development,	 innovations,	 and	 trusted	 cooperation	 necessary	 for	 a	 national	 
           cohesion	on	cybersecurity.	 
	 
8.5.3		    The	proposed	government	and	private	sector	synergy	should	culminate	into	the	 
           formation	 of	 Nigeria	 Institution	 of	 Cybersecurity	 (NIOC)	 that	 will	 help	 develop	 
           and	drive	a	coherent	body	of	useful	and	applicable	knowledge	in	cybersecurity.		 
	 
8.5.4	     The	NIOC	will	be	expected	to	be	built	on	nationwide	standards	with	the	aim	of	 
           harmonizing,	           developing,	           promoting	          and	      enhancing	           multidisciplinary	 
           professional	 skills	 capacity	 and	 standards	 in	 the	 development	 of	 Cybersecurity	 
           industry,	 while	 providing	 opportunity	 for	 the	 citizen	 positive	 engagement	 in	 
           cyberspace.

                                                  CHAPTER NINE  
                                                                     
          STRATEGY ON ONLINE CHILD ABUSE & EXPLOITATIONS  
  
9.1 Introduction:  
  
      •    Cyberspace has brought huge benefits to children around the world, with the  
           number of connected households increasing each year. While the potential for  
           good is undisputed, Internet has become increasingly accessible to the critical  
           segment  of  our  population  i.e.  Nigerian  children  and  young  people,  both  at  
           home and in schools.   
  

      •    Rather   than   surfing   the   Internet   passively,   children   and   young   people  
           participate  in  a  dynamic  online  environment  that  allows  them  to  generate,  
           manipulate and consume internet content like never before, forging their place  
           and identity in online communities.  
             
             
      •    More importantly, as a result of the universal availability of Internet access  
           in homes, schools, libraries, mobile phones, etc., children are increasingly  
           becoming involved in the use of the new technological application and taking  
           advantage            of    the      opportunity           it    provides         for      learning,         research,  
           entertainment and business.   
  

      •    However,   the   Internet   has   also   raised   new   and   disturbing   issues   of  
           vulnerability,  especially  for  children.     It  exposes  children  to  potentially  
           negative contents.   
  

      •    Children and Young Persons are the most active participants in online social  
           networking and therefore are potential victims of improperly disseminated  
           and  dysfunctional  contents  that  could  cause  disorientation  and  threaten  
           their survival and that of the society.  
  

      •    There are growing concerns on the distribution of online child abuse materials  
           targeted to children which are making them vulnerable to child pornography,  
           sexual abuse, harassment, exploitation, extremism, brain washing for terrorist  

	 

----------------------- Page 63-----------------------

          acts  of  violence  and  human  trafficking  resulting  into  unpleasant  outcome  of  
          the information age.   
  

     •    In order to address these issues of child online exploitation and its disastrous  
          consequences,  the  National  Cybersecurity  Policy  viewed  it  as  one  of  the  
          critical areas of focus.    
  

  

9.2        Rationale for COAEP  
            
9.2.1   The   National   Cybersecurity   Policy   framework   provides   a   rationale   and  
          philosophy to guide development of strategy for Nigerian Child Online Abuse  
          and Exploitation.  

9.2.2   The Principles on Child Online Abuse & Exploitation and Counter-measures  
          emphasized  Social  Media  as  a  vital  attractive  channel  and  tool  for  social  
          interactions  and  productive  engagements.  Regrettably,  the  openness  and  
          transparent nature of cyberspace have been exploited for good causes and  
          malicious intents.   

9.2.3   Therefore, there is need for the following actions;  

               i.  Integration   of   Child   Online   Abuse   and   Exploitation   into   National  
                   legislation on cybercrime and cybersecurity.  
                     
               ii.   There is a need to establish that any act against a child which is illegal  
                   in  the  real  world  is  illegal  online  and  that  online  data  protection  and  
                   privacy rules for legal minor are also adequate.  
            
               iii.  Ensure  that  a  mechanism  is  established  and  is  widely  promoted  to  
                   provide a readily understood means for reporting illegal content found  
                   on the internet , for example , a national hotline which has the capacity  
                   to  respond  rapidly    and  have  illegal  material  removed    or  rendered  
                   inaccessible  
  

9.2.4     It  is  the  intention  of  government  to  harness  counter-measures  through  a  
          legislative framework, policy and strategic actions to address cyber abuse and  
          online exploitation of Nigerian Child in a manner that will prevent and curtail  
          cybercriminal intents and related malicious acts inimical to the national dignity,  
          security and economic interests of the country.  
  
  
9.3  Objectives   

9.3.1   To  provide  common  approach  in  the  development  and  implementation  of  
          National Countermeasures strategy.  

	 

----------------------- Page 64-----------------------

9.3.2   To provide robust security initiatives, action plan, and roadmap that will give  
         overall      direction       to    the     planning        and      implementation          of     these  
         countermeasures strategy within the framework of National Security.   

9.3.3   The  strategy  addresses  urgent  security  and  law  enforcement  challenges,  
         roles and shared responsibilities and government interventions.  

9.3.4   The   strategy   harnesses   frameworks   that   provide   coherent   structure   for  
         coordination of multi stakeholder engagement.  

  

9.4      Strategic Approach  

         These   objectives   are   anchored   through   the   following   approaches   while  
         considering our socio-economic security peculiarity and vulnerable operating  
         environment  for  the  purpose  of  protecting  Nigerian  children  and  young  
         generations on the internet.  

          i.    The National Cybersecurity Strategy approach adopts multi-stakeholder  
                and  multi-sectorial  collaboration  through  partnership  and  alliances  of  
                government and key actors with clearly defined and specific guidelines  
                for policy makers, law enforcement and security agencies.   

                  

         ii.    The  partnership  and  alliances  will  be  forged  to  ensure  cooperation  
                for   action   and   mutual   awareness   among   stakeholders   on   the  
                consequence of improper engagement in cyberspace.  

9.5      Strategy   
           
9.5.1    Initiative 1: Focusing on National Process Mechanism  
           
   i.    There shall be Infusion of Child Online Abuse and Exploitation Protection  
         Strategy (COAEPS) into the larger framework for National cooperation on  
         cybersecurity.  
           
   ii.   Establishment  of  a  unit  under  the  National  Cybersecurity    Coordinating  
         Center      (NCCC)   to   handle   matters   relating   to   Child   Online   Abuse   and  
         Exploitation within the scope National Cybersecurity Policy.  
  

  iii.   The  COAEP  unit  of  NCCC  will  collaborate  with  industry  regulators  and  
         operators        to     implement         a    coherent        Countermeasures              Technical  
         Mechanisms  (CTM)  to  prevent  access  to  web  sites  identified  as  hosting  

	 

----------------------- Page 65-----------------------

          contents that are offensive to children and to implement  processes to enable  
          the removal of any child sexual abuse content posted on their own services.  
  

  iv.     The  Unit  will  provide  partnership  mechanism  in  regard  to  the  promotion  of  
          public awareness, messages and campaigns center on safety and security of  
          Nigeria children interactions online.  
  

  v.      The unit will train and build the capacity of Nigerian Law enforcement officers  
          to  conduct  investigations  into  Internet  related  crimes  against  children  and  
          young people and maintain a register of convicted online crime offenders.   
  

  vi.     The  unit  will  facilitate  national  processes  which  ensure  that  all  Child  Abuse  
          and  Exploitation  materials  found  in  cyberspace  are  channeled  towards  a  
          centralized, national resource.   
             
            
9.5.2   Initiative 2: Focusing on International Process Mechanism  

    i.    The  NCCC  will  drive  Virtual  National  Taskforce  (VNT)  which  will  work  with  
          Virtual  Global  Taskforce,  a  law  enforcement  body  which  provides  a  24/7  
          mechanism to receive reports about illegal behavior or content from persons  
          across the globe. The nation will develop modality for working with this global  
          security   platform   most   especially   for   countermeasures   against   terrorist  
                                                           3 
          recruitment and online predators.   
  

   ii.    It  is  strategically  essential  that  the  Nigerian  law  enforcement  community  
          becomes fully informed through training and capacity building and empower  
          through  legislation  to  help  make  the  Internet  safer  for  children  and  young  
          people.  
            
  iii.    Investing in training for law enforcement, prosecutorial and building capacity  
          of  Nigerian  Judges  through  collaboration  with  National  Judiciary  Institutes.  
          Investment  will  also  be  needed  in  acquiring  and  maintaining  the  facilities  
          necessary to obtain and interpret forensics evidence from digital devices on  
          Child Abuse Materials.

9.6.1     NCCC  will  ensure  that  a  working  mechanism  is  established  and  is  widely  
          promoted to provide a readily understood  means for reporting illegal content  
         found on the Internet, for example, a national hotline which has the capacity to  
          respond rapidly and have illegal material removed or rendered inaccessible.  

9.6.2     NCCC  will  ensure  various  security  and  law  enforcement  agencies  in  the  
         country  implement  abuse  report  mechanisms  which  will  be  prominently  
         displayed on relevant parts of any web site that allows user generated content  
         to  appear.  It  should  also  be  possible  for  people  who  feel  threatened  in  any  
         way, or for people who have witnessed any worrying activity on the Internet,  
         to be able to report it as quickly as possible to the relevant law enforcement  
         agencies that need to be trained and ready to respond.   
           
9.6.3     NCCC will promote a number of software programmes which can help screen  
         out unwanted material or block unwanted contacts. Utilizing some of the child  
         safety  and  filtering  programmes   because  they  are  part  of  a  computer’s  
         operating system or they are provided as part of a package available from an  
          ISP or ESP. The manufacturers of some game consoles also provide similar  
         tools  if  the  device  is  Internet  enabled.  These  programmes  are  not  foolproof  
          but they can provide a welcome level of support, particularly in families with  
         younger  children.  These  technical  tools  will  be  used  as  part  of  a  broader  
         arsenal. Parental and/or guardian involvement is critical.  
  

9.6.4     It  is  strategically  essential  that  the  Nigerian  law  enforcement  community  
          becomes  fully  engaged  with  any  overall  strategy  to  help  make  the  Internet  
         safer for children and young people.  
  

9.6.5     Nigerian  Law  enforcement  officers  will  be  appropriately  trained  to  conduct  
          investigations into Internet related crimes against children and young people.  
         They  need  the  right  level  of  technical  knowledge  and  access  to  forensic  
         facilities to enable them to extract and interpret data obtained from computers  
         or the Internet.  
  

9.6.6     NCCC will establish a clear mechanism to enable children and young people,  
         or any member of the public, to report any incidents or concerns they might  
          have about a child’s or a young person’s online safety.  
  
  
9.7       National Security Response Measures  
           
  
9.7.1   With escalation of cybercrime, youths based conflict and terrorist recruitment,  
          bombing  attack  in  the  country,  the  Internet  has  made  possible  a  range  of  

	 

----------------------- Page 67-----------------------

         ways  of  abusing  children  and  recruiting  young  people,  e.g.,  through  web  
         cams, chat rooms and internet blog.   
  
9.7.2   The internet has also played a singular role in expanding the scale on which  
         Child  Abuse  Material  (CAM)  has  become  available  in  all  parts  of  the  world.  
          For these reasons, when addressing online safety concerns for children and  
         young  people  from  national  security  perspective,  the  Strategy  gives  special  
         consideration to the following:  
  
        i.    Outlawing “grooming” or other forms of remote enticement of legal minors  
              into inappropriate sexual contact or sexual activity, possession, production  
              and distribution of CAM, irrespective of the intent to distribute.  
       

       ii.    Taking additional  response steps to disrupt or reduce the traffic in CAM,  
              for example by establishing a national hotline and by deploying measures  
              which  will  block  access  to  web  sites  and  Usenet  Newsgroups  known  to  
              contain or advertise the availability of CAM.  
       

       iii.   Ensuring that national processes are in place which ensure that all CAM  
              found in a country is channeled towards a centralized, national resource.  
       

      iv.     Developing strategies to address the demand for CAM particularly among  
              those  who  have  convictions  for  such  offences.  It  is  important  to  build  
              awareness  of  the  fact  that  this  is  not  a  victimless  crime:  children  are  
              abused to produce the material being viewed and by intentionally viewing  
              or downloading CAM one is contributing directly to the abuse of the child  
              depicted  and  one  is  also  encouraging  the  abuse  of  more  children  to  
              produce more pictures.  
       

       v.     Building  awareness  of  the  fact  that  Nigerian  children  usually  would  not  
              consent to being sexually abused, whether for the production of CAM or in  
              any other way. Encourage people who use CAM to seek help, while at the  
              same time, making them aware that they will be held criminally responsible  
              for the illegal activity in which they engaged/are engaging.  
       

      vi.     Ensuring  that  law  enforcement  crime  prevention  strategies  as  well  as  
              school-based and social programmes include sections on cyber safety and  
              the risks posed by online predatory behavior, with age appropriate advice.  
       

	 

----------------------- Page 68-----------------------

      vii.    NCCC  maintains  a  register  of  convicted  online  crime  offenders.  Courts  
              have issued judicial orders banning such offenders from using the Internet  
              altogether  or  from  using  parts  of  the  Internet  which  are  frequented  by  
              children  and  young  people.  The  problem  with  these  orders  hitherto  has  
              been its enforcement.  
       

     viii.    Consideration will be given to integrating the list of convicted sex offenders  
              into a block list which will prevent those on it from visiting or joining certain  
              web sites.  
       ix.    Providing  appropriate  long  term  support  for  victims.  Where  children  or  
              young  people  have  been  victimized  online,  where  for  example  an  illegal  
              image of  them has appeared on the Internet, they will naturally feel very  
              concerned about who might have seen it and what impact this will have on  
              them. It could leave the child or young person feeling vulnerable to bullying  
              or to further sexual exploitation and abuse.  
       

       x.     Ensuring        that     a    grassroots’        reporting      and      intelligence       gathering  
              mechanism  is  established  and  is  widely  promoted  to  provide  a  readily  
              understood  and  rapid  means  for  reporting  illegal  content  or  illegal  or  
              worrying  online  behavior  e.g.  a  system  similar  to  that  which  has  been  
              established         by    the     Virtual      Global      Taskforce.        The      use      of    the  
               INTERPOLi24/7 system will be encouraged.  
       

      xi.     Ensuring   that   a   sufficient   number   of   law   enforcement   officials   are  
              appropriately  trained  in  investigating  Internet  and  computer-based  crime  
              and have access to appropriate forensic facilities to enable them extract  
              and interpret relevant digital data.  
       

      xii.     Investing   in   training   for   law   enforcement,   prosecutorial   and   judicial  
              authorities  in  the  methods  used  by  online  criminals  to  perpetrate  these  
              crimes.  Investment  will  also  be  needed  in  acquiring  and  maintaining  the  
              facilities necessary to obtain and interpret forensics evidence from digital  
              devices.  
       

     xiii.     In  addition,      it  will  be  important  to  establish  bilateral  and  multilateral  
              collaboration  and  information  exchanges  with  relevant  law  enforcement  
              authorities and investigative bodies in other countries.

                 STRATEGY ON PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIP  
  
10. 1     Introduction  

     •    The   present   administration   has   demonstrated   her   commitment   to   the  
          prevailing security challenges by taking positive step to re-invigorate National  
          Cybersecurity Strategy as part of the National Security agenda.  
            
     •    The  Cybercrime  legislation  and  the  need  to  actualize  the  implementation  of  
          National Cybersecurity Strategy requires effective machinery of public-private  
          partnership  and  management  framework  to  drive  the  buildup  process  with  
          tripartite   synergy   of   the   whole   nation   including   the   government,   non- 
          government actors and international stakeholders.  
            
     •    In the light of the above, this section seeks to provide the government with a  
          strategic      public-partnership          management            framework         approach        for    the  
          implementation of National Cybersecurity Strategy.  
            
            
     •    The key elements of this strategy are as follows:  
             i.    The  PPP  Management  Framework  to  facilitate  the  cooperation  and  
                   partnership  in  the  implementation  of  National  Cybersecurity  Strategy  
                   among the tripartite stakeholders in the country.  
                      
            ii.    The Nature of the PPP Framework Model, Benefit, Impact & Direction.  
   
            iii.   Special Purpose Vehicle and Delivery channel through the setting up of  
                   PPP for Cyber security (3PC).  
  
           iv.     3PC Working Document & Terms of Reference  
                      
            v.     3PC Sustainable Strategy

           vi.      Evaluation & Appraisal    
                
                
10.2    The  Imperative  of  Public-Private  Partnership  Framework  for  National  
          Cybersecurity Strategy  

          •    In  the  current  dispensation,  engagement  in  cyberspace  is  central  to  the  
               existence, survivability, relevancy, as well as security and protection of the  
               public institutions and private sector businesses.   
                
          •    The public and private sectors’ interests are enormously intertwined with a  
               shared  responsibility  for  ensuring  a  secure  cyberspace  and  a  protected  
               critical  economic  infrastructure  upon  which  businesses  and  government  
               services depend.  
                
          •    Public-Private Partnership framework is critical to the build-up process and  
               overall success of the National Cybersecurity Strategy.  
                
          •    Right  from  the  commencement  of  the  efforts  on  National  Cybersecurity  
               Strategy since 2003, which was reinvigorated in 2010 and till the present  
               time.  Most  often,  private  sectors  are  usually  caught  unprepared  in  the  
               buildup process.  
            
          •    There is a concrete evidence that the Federal government cannot succeed  
               in the many facets of securing National cyberspace if it works in isolation  
               in her build up in the implementation of National Cybersecurity Strategy.  
               Therefore  PPPC  is  set  to  define  roles  and  responsibilities,  integrate  
               capabilities,   and   facilitate   joint   ownership   of   the   problems   and   the  
               challenges  towards  developing  holistic  Cybersecurity  Strategy.  It  is  only  
               through  such  sustainable  partnerships  that  the  Country  will  be  able  to  
               enthrone cybersecurity and reap the full benefits of the digital revolution.  
            
                
          •    Furthermore,  the  National  Security  challenge  of  securing  cyberspace  
               requires an increased effort in all stakeholders’ collaborations. This effort  
               should   seek—in   continued   collaboration   with   the   private   sector—to  
               improve the security of national interoperable networks   
                
          •    The private sector, however, designs, invest, builds, owns, operates and  
               maintains      most  of  the  critical  information  infrastructures  that  support  
               government and private users alike.  
                
          •    Therefore  Industry  and  governments  share  the  responsibility  for  the  

	 

----------------------- Page 71-----------------------

               security and reliability of the infrastructure and the transactions that take  
               place     on     it  and     should       work     closely      together      to    address       these  
               interdependencies.   
                
          •    There      are    various      approaches          the    NCSS        take    to    address       these  
               challenges, some of which require changes in law and policy.   
            
     •    Thus private-sector engagement is required to help address the limitations of  
          law  enforcement  and  national  security.  The  Federal  government  and  the  
          private sector have an enduring interest in assuring the security of the digital  
          infrastructure. Accordingly, government-industry collaboration is fundamental  
          to achieving National Cybersecurity Strategy.   
             
     •    It  is,  therefore,  critically  important  that  government  and  private  sector  work  
          together       in    a    proactive       way.      Successful         government-private             sector  
          collaboration requires three important component:   
            
        i.    A clear value proposition:   
                
                    •   NCCC will articulate the mutual benefits to government and private  
                        sector partners.  
                          
        ii.    Clearly defined roles and responsibilities.  
                
                    •   NCCC  will  develop  a  framework  for  common  understanding  that  
                        will  guide  mutual  working  relation  and  define  basis  of  relationship  
                        between  NCCC  and  private  sector  with  clearly  define  roles  and  
                        responsibilities.  
                          
       iii.    Trust:   
                
                    •   This is fundamental and necessary for establishing, developing, and  
                        maintaining         sharing       relationships         between        government           and  
                        industry.  
                          
                    •   NCCC         will   develop,       engender,        nurture      and      infuse     a    Trust  
                        Framework for public-private sector cooperation and understanding  
                        on   critical   issues   of   cybersecurity   assurance   and   monitoring,  
                        sectorial  CERT,  and  critical  information  infrastructure  protection  
                        plan.  
                          
                    •   NCCC  will  provide  a  Trust  Framework  that  respect  and  address  
                        industry areas of concern in a manner that will not jeopardize but

10.3    Public-Private Sector Partnership Management Strategy (PPPMS)  

10.3.1 The nature of the proposed PPMF Model involves the following:  

           •    A linear build-up structural processes and national coordination through a  
                PPP Special Purpose Vehicle created by NCCC for this purpose  
           •    The  SPV  drives  and  coordinates  all  the  PPP  buildup  processes  for  the  
                coordination of government and industry partnership.

            i.    It  provides  opportunity  for  government  to  effectively  engage  the  core  
                  stakeholders  in  the  country  while  entrenching  nationally  acceptable  
                  National Cybersecurity Strategy at the onset.   
                    
            ii.   Cybersecurity Strategy is a complex set of issues involving legal, socio- 
                  economic,        and     national     security     considerations.        Several      public  
                  institutions have significant jurisdictional claim on cybersecurity issues..  
                  The  PPPMF  will,  therefore,  provide  opportunities  to  address  all  the  
                  divergent positions of these stakeholders.   
           
           iii.   Cybersecurity strategy has a deep connection with critical information  
                  infrastructure,       economy        and     security.      Private     sector      provides  
                  technology innovations, critical resources and technical standards that  
                  the government needs to drive National Cybersecurity Strategy. While  
                  government          provides       enabling       mechanisms,          instruments        and  
                  authorities to transform industry best practices and standards into the

                      framework of National Cybersecurity Strategy, thus, PPPMF will assist  
                      government to address structural weaknesses.  
             
             iv.      National   Cybersecurity   Strategy   driven   through   the   public-private  
                      partnership  of  government  and  private  sector  has  greater  national  
                      security  implication  and  economy  protection  values,  than  government  
                      working  alone  or  in  partnership  with  multilateral  and  multinational  
                      institutions.   
             
              v.      PPPMF  enables  a  trusted  platform  for  strategic  information  sharing  
                      between government and private sector critical for the overall success  
                      of National Cybersecurity Strategy.   
             
             vi.      It provides  partnership vehicle for National Executive Council, National  
                      Assembly  and  private  sector  to  achieve  mutual  understanding  and  
                      cooperation            on      the     operation          of     Cybersecurity             legislation         and  
                      implementation of National Cybersecurity Strategy.  
             
                        
            vii.      PPPMF  will  facilitate  structural  coordination  across  the  public  and  
                      private  sector,  building  public  confidence  in  National  Cybersecurity  
                      Strategy.   
             
           viii.      Government  depends  on  a  privately  operated  cyber  infrastructure.  
                      Through  the  PPPMF,  government  engages  with  industry  to  continue  
                      building the foundation of a trusted partnership. This engagement will  
                      build value propositions that are understood by both government and  
                      industry partners for the benefit of National Cybersecurity Strategy.
