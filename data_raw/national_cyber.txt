National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

FOREWORD

FOREWORD

The UK is one of the world’s leading
digital nations. Much of our prosperity
now depends on our ability to secure our
technology, data and networks from the
many threats we face.
Yet cyber attacks are growing more
frequent, sophisticated and damaging when
they succeed. So we are taking decisive
action to protect both our economy and the
privacy of UK citizens.
Our National Cyber Security Strategy sets out
our plan to make Britain confident, capable
and resilient in a fast-moving digital world.
Over the lifetime of this five-year strategy,
we will invest £1.9 billion in defending
our systems and infrastructure, deterring
our adversaries, and developing a wholesociety capability – from the biggest
companies to the individual citizen.
From the most basic cyber hygiene, to the
most sophisticated deterrence, we need a
comprehensive response.
We will focus on raising the cost of
mounting an attack against anyone in the
UK, both through stronger defences and
better cyber skills. This is no longer just
an issue for the IT department but for the
whole workforce. Cyber skills need to reach
into every profession.
National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

The new National Cyber Security Centre will
provide a hub of world-class, user-friendly
expertise for businesses and individuals, as
well as rapid response to major incidents.
Government has a clear leadership role,
but we will also foster a wider commercial
ecosystem, recognising where industry
can innovate faster than us. This includes
a drive to get the best young minds into
cyber security.
The cyber threat impacts the whole of our
society, so we want to make very clear
that everyone has a part to play in our
national response. It’s why this strategy is
an unprecedented exercise in transparency.
We can no longer afford to have this
discussion behind closed doors.
Ultimately, this is a threat that cannot be
completely eliminated. Digital technology
works because it is open, and that
openness brings with it risk. What we
can do is reduce the threat to a level that
ensures we remain at the vanguard of the
digital revolution. This strategy sets out how.

The Rt Hon Philip Hammond MP,
Chancellor of the Exchequer

PREFACE

PREFACE

Our primary responsibility is to keep
the nation safe and deliver competent
government. This strategy reflects these
duties. It is a bold and ambitious approach to
tackling the many threats our country faces in
cyberspace. Managing and mitigating those
threats is a task for us all but the Government
recognises its special responsibility to lead
the national effort required.
The Government is committed to ensuring
the commitments set out in this strategy
are carried out and that we accurately
monitor and regularly report on progress
in meeting them. We will also keep our
approach under review and respond to
changes in the level of threat we face as
well as evolutions in security technologies.

As Minister for the Cabinet Office with
responsibility for cyber security and
government security, I am determined
to see this strategy implemented in full.
I will work closely with colleagues across
Government and with partners in the
Devolved Administrations, the wider public
sector, industry and academia to ensure we
achieve that ambition.

The Rt Hon Ben Gummer MP,
Minister for the Cabinet Office
and Paymaster General

Government also has a special
responsibility to the citizen, to companies
and organisations operating in the UK,
and to our international allies and partners.
We should be able to assure them that
every effort made has been to render our
systems safe and to protect our data and
our networks from attack or interference.
We must therefore set ourselves the highest
standards of cyber security and ensure we
adhere to them, both as the cornerstone
of the country’s national security and
economic wellbeing and also as an example
for others to follow. We shall report back on
progress made on an annual basis.

SUMMARY

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

9
Section 1
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

1.1.
The future of the UK’s security and
prosperity rests on digital foundations.
The challenge of our generation is to build
a flourishing digital society that is both
resilient to cyber threats, and equipped with
the knowledge and capabilities required to
maximise opportunities and manage risks.
1.2.
We are critically dependent on the
Internet. However, it is inherently insecure
and there will always be attempts to exploit
weaknesses to launch cyber attacks. This
threat cannot be eliminated completely, but
the risk can be greatly reduced to a level
that allows society to continue to prosper,
and benefit from the huge opportunities
that digital technology brings.
1.3.
The 2011 National Cyber Security
Strategy, underpinned by the British
Government’s £860m National Cyber
Security Programme, has delivered
substantial improvements to UK cyber
security. It achieved important outcomes
by looking to the market to drive secure
cyber behaviours. But this approach has
not achieved the scale and pace of change
required to stay ahead of the fast moving
threat. We now need to go further.
1.4.
Our vision for 2021 is that
the UK is secure and resilient to
cyber threats, prosperous and
confident in the digital world.
1.5.
To realise this vision we will
work to achieve the following objectives:
•	 DEFEND We have the
means to defend the UK
against evolving cyber
threats, to respond
effectively to incidents, to
ensure UK networks, data and systems
are protected and resilient. Citizens,
businesses and the public sector
have the knowledge and ability to
defend themselves.

•	 DETER The UK will be a
hard target for all forms of
aggression in cyberspace.
We detect, understand,
investigate and disrupt
hostile action taken against us,
pursuing and prosecuting offenders.
We have the means to take offensive
action in cyberspace, should we
choose to do so.
•	 DEVELOP We have
an innovative, growing
cyber security industry,
underpinned by worldleading scientific
research and development. We have
a self-sustaining pipeline of talent
providing the skills to meet our national
needs across the public and private
sectors. Our cutting-edge analysis
and expertise will enable the UK to
meet and overcome future threats
and challenges.
1.6.
Underpinning these objectives, we
will pursue INTERNATIONAL ACTION
and exert our influence by investing in
partnerships that shape the global evolution
of cyberspace in a manner that advances
our wider economic and security interests.
We will deepen existing links with our
closest international partners, recognising
that this enhances our collective security.
We will also develop relationships with new
partners to build their levels of cyber security
and protect UK interests overseas. We will
do this both bilaterally and multilaterally,
including through the EU, NATO and the
UN. We will deliver clear messages about
consequences to adversaries who threaten
to harm our interests, or those of our allies,
in cyberspace.
1.7.
To achieve these outcomes over
the next five years, the UK Government
intends to intervene more actively and use
increased investment, while continuing
National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

10
Section 1
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

to support market forces to raise cyber
security standards across the UK. The
UK Government, in partnership with the
Devolved Administrations of Scotland,
Wales and Northern Ireland, will work with
the private and public sectors to ensure that
individuals, businesses and organisations
adopt the behaviours required to stay safe
on the Internet. We will have measures in
place to intervene (where necessary and
within the scope of our powers) to drive
improvements that are in the national
interest, particularly in relation to the cyber
security of our critical national infrastructure.
1.8.
The UK Government will draw on
its capabilities and those of industry to
develop and apply active cyber defence
measures to significantly enhance the levels
of cyber security across UK networks.
These measures include minimising the
most common forms of phishing attacks,
filtering known bad IP addresses, and
actively blocking malicious online activity.
Improvements in basic cyber security
will raise the UK’s resilience to the most
commonly deployed cyber threats.

1.11. We will have the means to respond
to cyber attacks in the same way as
we respond to any other attack, using
whichever capability is most appropriate,
including an offensive cyber capability.
1.12. We will use the authority and
influence of the UK Government to invest
in programmes to address the shortage of
cyber security skills in the UK, from schools
to universities and across the workforce.
1.13. We will launch two new cyber
innovation centres to drive the development
of cutting-edge cyber products and
dynamic new cyber security companies.
We will also allocate a proportion of the
£165m Defence and Cyber Innovation
Fund to support innovative procurement in
defence and security.
1.14. We will invest a total of £1.9 billion
over the next five years to transform
significantly the UK’s cyber security.

1.9.
We have created a National Cyber
Security Centre (NCSC) to be the authority
on the UK’s cyber security environment,
sharing knowledge, addressing systemic
vulnerabilties and providing leadership on
key national cyber security issues.
1.10. We will ensure that our Armed Forces
are resilient and have the strong cyber
defences they need to secure and defend
their networks and platforms, continuing
to operate and retaining global freedom of
manoeuvre despite cyber threats. Our military
Cyber Security Operations Centre will work
closely with the NCSC and we will ensure
that the Armed Forces can assist in the event
of a significant national cyber attack.

against those threats. See Glossary for an explanation of all technical terms.

INTRODUCTION

2. INTRODUCTION

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

13
Section 2
INTRODUCTION

2.1.
Information and communication
technologies have evolved over the
last two decades and are now integrated
into virtually every aspect of our lives.
The UK is a digitalised society. Our
economy and our daily lives are the
richer for it.

determination to address cyber threats
and “put in place tough and innovative
measures, as a world leader in cyber
security”. This National Cyber Security
Strategy delivers on that commitment.

2.2.
The transformation brought
about by this digitalisation creates
new dependencies. Our economy, the
administration of government and the
provision of essential services now rely
on the integrity of cyberspace and on the
infrastructure, systems and data which
underpin it. A loss of trust in that integrity
would jeopardise the benefits of this
technological revolution.

2.6.
In preparing this new strategy,
the Government is building on the
achievements, objectives and
judgements of the first five-year
National Cyber Security Strategy
issued in 2011. The Government
invested £860m over that period, and
is proud of what has been achieved.
The policies, institutions and initiatives
developed over the last five years have
helped to establish the UK as a leading
global player in cyber security.

2.3.
Much of the hardware and
software originally developed to facilitate
this interconnected digital environment
has prioritised efficiency, cost and the
convenience of the user, but has not always
had security designed in from the start.
Malicious actors – hostile states, criminal
or terrorist organisations and individuals –
can exploit the gap between convenience
and security. Narrowing that gap is a
national priority.

2.7.
These are sound foundations.
But the persistence and ingenuity of those
who would threaten us, the prevalence
of our vulnerabilities and gaps in our
capabilities and defences mean we need
to work even harder to keep pace with
the threat. A comprehensive approach is
required if we are to effectively secure our
cyber interests. Our resolution to make
further investment and interventions is
based on the following assessments:

2.4.
The expansion of the Internet
beyond computers and mobile phones
into other cyber-physical or ‘smart’
systems is extending the threat of remote
exploitation to a whole host of new
technologies. Systems and technologies
that underpin our daily lives – such as
power grids, air traffic control systems,
satellites, medical technologies, industrial
plants and traffic lights – are connected
to the Internet and, therefore, potentially
vulnerable to interference.
2.5.
The 2015 National Security
Strategy (NSS) reaffirmed the cyber
threat as a Tier One risk to UK interests.
The NSS set out the Government’s

•	 the scale and dynamic nature of cyber
threats, and our vulnerability and
dependency, mean that maintaining
the current approach will not in itself
be sufficient to keep us safe;
•	 a market based approach to
the promotion of cyber hygiene has
not produced the required pace and
scale of change; therefore, Government
has to lead the way and intervene
more directly by bringing its influence
and resources to bear to address
cyber threats;
•	 the Government alone cannot provide
for all aspects of the nation’s cyber
security. An embedded and
sustainable approach is needed
National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

14
Section 2
INTRODUCTION

where citizens, industry and other
partners in society and government,
play their full part in securing our
networks, services and data;
•	 the UK needs a vibrant cyber security
sector and supporting skills base that
can keep pace with and get ahead of
the changing threat.

THE SCOPE OF THE STRATEGY
2.8.
This strategy is intended to shape
the Government’s policy, while also offering
a coherent and compelling vision to share
with the public and private sector, civil
society, academia and the wider population.
2.9.
The strategy covers the whole of
the UK. The UK Government will seek to
ensure the strategy is implemented for

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

all parts of the UK, recognising that, to
the extent that it touches on devolved
matters, we will work closely with the
devolved Governments on its application
to Scotland, Wales and Northern
Ireland (respecting the three separate
legal jurisdictions, and four education
systems, that exist in the UK). Where
proposals set out in the strategy relate to
devolved matters, their implementation
will be agreed as appropriate with those
Governments in accordance with the
devolution settlements.
2.10. The strategy sets out proposed
or recommended actions aimed at all
sectors of the economy and society,
from central government departments, to
leaders across industry and the individual
citizen. The strategy aims to increase

15
Section 2
INTRODUCTION

cyber security at all levels for our collective
benefit and will be the basis on which the
UK engages internationally to promote
good internet governance.
2.11. In this strategy, ‘cyber security’
refers to the protection of information
systems (hardware, software and
associated infrastructure), the data on
them, and the services they provide,
from unauthorised access, harm or misuse.
This includes harm caused intentionally
by the operator of the system, or
accidentally, as a result of failing to
follow security procedures.
2.12. Consistent with our assessment of
the challenge we face and building on the
achievements of the 2011 strategy, this
document sets out:

•	 our updated assessment of the
strategic context, including the current
and evolving threats: who poses the
most serious threat to our interests,
and the tools at their disposal;
•	 a review of vulnerabilities and how these
have developed over the last five years;
•	 the Government’s vision for cyber
security in 2021 and the key objectives
to achieve that goal, including guiding
principles, roles and responsibilities,
and how and where government
intervention will make a difference;
•	 how we intend to put our policy
into practice: setting out where the
Government will lead and where we
expect to work in partnership with
others; and
•	 how we intend to assess our progress
towards our objectives.

Section 3
STRATEGIC CONTEXT

3.1.
When the last National Cyber
Security Strategy was published in 2011,
the scale of technological change and its
impact was already apparent. The trends
and opportunities described then have
since accelerated. New technologies
and applications have come to the fore,
and greater uptake of internet-based
technologies worldwide, in particular
in developing countries, has offered
increasing opportunities for economic and
social development. These developments
have brought, or will bring, significant
advantages to connected societies such
as ours. But as our reliance on networks
in the UK and overseas grows, so do the
opportunities for those who would seek
to compromise our systems and data.
Equally, the geopolitical landscape has
changed. Malicious cyber activity knows
no international boundaries. State actors
are experimenting with offensive cyber
capabilities. Cyber criminals are broadening
their efforts and expanding their strategic
modus operandi to achieve higher value
pay-outs from UK citizens, organisations
and institutions. Terrorists, and their
sympathisers, are conducting low-level
attacks and aspire to carry out more
significant acts. This chapter sets out our
assessment of the nature of these threats,
our vulnerabilities and how these continue
to evolve.

THREATS
Cyber criminals
3.2.
This strategy deals with cyber crime
in the context of two interrelated forms of
criminal activity:
•	 cyber-dependent crimes – crimes
that can be committed only
through the use of Information and
Communications Technology (ICT)
devices, where the devices are both
the tool for committing the crime,
and the target of the crime (e.g.
developing and propagating malware
for financial gain, hacking to steal,
damage, distort or destroy data
and/or network or activity); and
•	 cyber-enabled crimes – traditional
crimes which can be increased in scale
or reach by the use of computers,
computer networks or other forms of
ICT (such as cyber-enabled fraud and
data theft).
3.3.
Much of the most serious cyber
crime – mainly fraud, theft and extortion –
against the UK continues to be perpetrated
predominantly by financially motivated
Russian-language organised criminal
groups (OCGs) in Eastern Europe, with
many of the criminal marketplace services
being hosted in these countries. However,
the threat also emanates from other
countries and regions, and from inside the
UK itself, with emerging threats from South
Asia and West Africa of increasing concern.

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

18
Section 3
STRATEGIC CONTEXT

3.4.
Even when key individuals
responsible for the most damaging cyber
criminal activities against the UK are
identified, it is often difficult for the UK
and international law enforcement
agencies to prosecute them when they
are located in jurisdictions with limited,
or no, extradition arrangements.
3.5.
These OCGs are principally
responsible for developing and deploying
the increasingly advanced malware that
infects the computers and networks of
UK citizens, our industry and government.
The impact is dispersed throughout
the UK, but the cumulative effect is
significant. These attacks are becoming
increasingly aggressive and confrontational,
as illustrated by the increasing use of
ransomware, and threats of distributed
denial of service (DDoS) for extortion.
3.6.
Whilst OCGs may pose a significant
threat to our collective prosperity and
security, equally of concern is the
continuing threat from acts of less
sophisticated but widespread cyber crimes
carried out against individuals or smaller
organisations.

Internet banking fraud, which covers
fraudulent payments taken from a
customer’s bank account using the
internet banking channel, rose by 64%
to £133.5m in 2015. The number of
cases increased at a lower rate of 23%,
which Financial Fraud Action UK said
is evidence of the growing trend for
criminals to target business and high­
net-worth customers.

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

States and state-sponsored threats
3.7.
We regularly see attempts by states
and state-sponsored groups to penetrate
UK networks for political, diplomatic,
technological, commercial and strategic
advantage, with a principal focus on the
government, defence, finance, energy and
telecommunications sectors.
3.8.
The capacity and impact of
these state cyber programmes varies.
The most advanced nations continue
to improve their capabilities at pace,
integrating encryption and anonymisation
services into their tools in order to remain
covert. While they have the technical
capability to deploy sophisticated attacks,
they can often achieve their aims using
basic tools and techniques against
vulnerable targets because the defences
of their victims are poor.
3.9.
Only a handful of states have the
technical capabilities to pose a serious
threat to the UK’s overall security and
prosperity. But many other states
are developing sophisticated cyber
programmes that could pose a threat
to UK interests in the near future. Many
states seeking to develop cyber espionage
capability can purchase computer network
exploitation tools ‘off the shelf’ and
repurpose these to conduct espionage.
3.10. Beyond the espionage threat, a small
number of hostile foreign threat actors have
developed and deployed offensive cyber
capabilities, including destructive ones.
These capabilities threaten the security of
the UK’s critical national infrastructure and
industrial control systems. Some states
may use these capabilities in contravention
of international law in the belief that
they can do so with relative impunity,
encouraging others to follow suit. Whilst
destructive attacks around the world remain
rare, they are rising in number and impact.

19
Section 3
STRATEGIC CONTEXT

Terrorists

Hacktivists

3.11. Terrorist groups continue to aspire
to conduct damaging cyber activity against
the UK and its interests. The current
technical capability of terrorists is judged
to be low. Nonetheless the impact of even
low-capability activity against the UK to
date has been disproportionately high:
simple defacements and doxing activity
(where hacked personal details are ‘leaked’
online) enable terrorist groups and their
supporters to attract media attention and
intimidate their victims.

3.13. Hacktivist groups are decentralised
and issue-orientated. They form and select
their targets in response to perceived
grievances, introducing a vigilante quality
to many of their acts. While the majority
of hacktivist cyber activity is disruptive in
nature (website defacement or DDoS), more
able hacktivists have been able to inflict
greater and lasting damage on their victims.

“Terrorists using the Internet for
their purposes does not equal cyber­
terrorism. However, by increasingly
engaging in cyber-space, and given the
availability of cyber-crime as a service,
one can assume that they would be in
the position to launch cyber attacks”
ENISA Threat Landscape 2015
3.12. The current assessment is that
physical, rather than cyber, terrorist attacks
will remain the priority for terrorist groups
for the immediate future. As an increasingly
computer-literate generation engages
in extremism, potentially exchanging
enhanced technical skills, we envisage
a greater volume of low-sophistication
(defacement or DDoS) disruptive activity
against the UK. The potential for a number
of skilled extremist lone actors to emerge
will also increase, as will the risk that a
terrorist organisation will seek to enlist an
established insider. Terrorists will likely
use any cyber capability to achieve the
maximum effect possible. Thus, even a
moderate increase in terrorist capability
may constitute a significant threat to the
UK and its interests.

INSIDERS
Insider threats remain a cyber risk to
organisations in the UK. Malicious
insiders, who are trusted employees
of an organisation and have access
to critical systems and data, pose
the greatest threat. They can cause
financial and reputational damage
through the theft of sensitive data and
intellectual property. They can also pose
a destructive cyber threat if they use
their privileged knowledge, or access, to
facilitate, or launch, an attack to disrupt
or degrade critical services on the
network of their organisations, or wipe
data from the network.
Of equal concern are those insiders
or employees who accidentally cause
cyber harm through inadvertent
clicking on a phishing email, plugging
an infected USB into a computer,
or ignoring security procedures and
downloading unsafe content from the
Internet. Whilst they have no intention
of deliberately harming the organisation,
their privileged access to systems and
data mean their actions can cause just
as much damage as a malicious insider.
These individuals are often the victims of
social engineering – they can unwittingly
provide access to the networks of their
organisation or carry out instructions in
good faith that benefit the fraudster.

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

20
Section 3
STRATEGIC CONTEXT

The overall cyber risk to an organisation
from insider threats is not just about
unauthorised access to information
systems and their content. The physical
security controls protecting those
systems from inappropriate access, or
removal of sensitive data or proprietary
information on different forms of media,
are equally important. Similarly, a robust
personnel security culture that is alive
to the threat posed by disaffected
employees, fraud in the workforce
and industrial and other forms of
espionage is an important element in a
comprehensive approach to security.

‘Script Kiddies’
3.14. So-called ‘script kiddies’ – generally
less skilled individuals who use scripts
or programmes developed by others to
conduct cyber attacks – are not assessed
as posing a substantive threat to the
wider economy or society. But they do
have access to hacking guides, resources
and tools on the Internet. Due to the
vulnerabilities found in internet-facing
systems used by many organisations, the
actions of ‘script kiddies’ can, in some
cases, have a disproportionately damaging
impact on an affected organisation.

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

CASE STUDY 1: TALKTALK
COMPROMISE
On 21 October 2015, UK
telecommunications provider TalkTalk
reported a successful cyber attack and
a possible breach of customer data.
Subsequent investigation determined
that a database containing customer
details had been accessed via publicfacing internet servers, with the records
of approximately 157,000 customers at
risk, including names, addresses and
bank account details.
On the same day, several TalkTalk
employees received an email with a
ransom demand for payment in Bitcoins.
The attackers detailed the structure of
the database as apparent proof that it
had been accessed.
TalkTalk’s report of the breach helped
the police, supported by specialists at
the National Crime Agency, to arrest the
main suspects, all based in the UK, in
October and November 2015.
The attack demonstrates that, even
within large cyber-aware organisations,
vulnerabilities can persist. Their
exploitation can have a disproportionate
effect in terms of reputational damage
and operational disruption, and this
incident generated substantial media
attention. TalkTalk’s rapid reporting of
the breach enabled law enforcement
to respond in a timely manner, and
both the public and government to
mitigate the potential loss of sensitive
data. The incident cost TalkTalk an
estimated £60m and the loss of 95,000
customers, as well as a sharp drop in
their share price.

Section 3
STRATEGIC CONTEXT

CASE STUDY 2: ATTACK ON BANGLADESH
BANK’S SWIFT SYSTEM
The Society for Worldwide Interbank
Financial Telecommunication (SWIFT)
provides a network that enables financial
institutions worldwide to send and receive
information about financial transactions
in a secure way. As SWIFT sends
payment orders which must be settled
by correspondent accounts that the
institutions have with each other, there
has long been concern over any potential
for this process to be compromised by
cyber criminals or other malicious actors,
seeking to inject illegitimate payment
orders into the system or, in a worst case
scenario, seeking to disable or disrupt the
functionality of the SWIFT network itself.
In early February 2016, an attacker
accessed the SWIFT payment system
of the Bangladesh Bank and instructed
the New York Federal Reserve bank to
transfer money from Bangladesh Bank’s
account to accounts in the Philippines.
The attempted fraud was US$951 million.
30 transactions, worth US$850 million,
were prevented by the banking system;
however, five transactions worth US$101
million went through. US$20 million, traced
to Sri Lanka, has since been recovered.
The remaining US$81 million transferred
to the Philippines was laundered through
casinos and some of the funds were then
forwarded to Hong Kong.
The forensic investigation launched
by Bangladesh Bank discovered that
malware had been installed on the bank’s
systems and had been used to gather
intelligence on the procedures used
by the bank for international payments
and fund transfers. Further analysis by
BAE Systems of the malware linked
to the attack uncovered sophisticated
functionality for interacting with the local

SWIFT Alliance Access software running in
the Bangladesh Bank infrastructure. BAE
concluded ‘that criminals are conducting
more and more sophisticated attacks
against victim organisations, particularly in
the area of network intrusions’.

CASE STUDY 3: UKRAINE POWER GRID
ATTACK
A cyber attack on western Ukrainian
electricity distribution companies
Prykarpattya Oblenergo and Kyiv
Oblenergo on 23 December 2015
caused a major power outage, with
disruption to over 50 substations on
the distribution networks. The region
reportedly experienced a blackout for
several hours and many other customers
and areas sustained lesser disruptions to
their power supplies, affecting more than
220,000 consumers.
Use of the BlackEnergy3 malware has
been blamed by some for the attack, after
samples were identified on the network.
At least six months before the attack,
attackers had sent phishing emails to the
offices of power utility companies in the
Ukraine containing malicious Microsoft
Office documents. However, the malware
was not likely to have been responsible
for opening the circuit breakers which
resulted in the outage. It is probable that
the malware enabled the attackers to
gather credentials that allowed them to
gain direct remote control of aspects of
the network, which would subsequently
enable them to trigger the outage.
This Ukraine incident is the first confirmed
instance of a disruptive cyber attack on an
electricity network. Instances such as this
further demonstrate the need for good cyber
security practices across all of our Critical
National Infrastructure (CNI) to prevent
similar incidents occurring in the UK.

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

Section 3
STRATEGIC CONTEXT

VULNERABILITIES
An expanding range of devices
3.15. When the last National Cyber
Security Strategy was published in
2011, most people conceived of cyber
security through the prism of protecting
devices such as their desktop computer
or laptop. Since then the Internet has
become increasingly integrated into our
daily lives in ways we are largely oblivious
to. The ‘Internet of Things’ creates new
opportunities for exploitation and increases
the potential impact of attacks which have
the potential to cause physical damage,
injury to persons and, in a worst case
scenario, death.
3.16. The rapid implementation of
connectivity in industrial control processes
in critical systems, across a wide range
of industries such as energy, mining,
agriculture and aviation, has created
the Industrial Internet of Things. This is
simultaneously opening up the possibility of
devices and processes, which were never
vulnerable to such interference in the past,
being hacked and tampered with, with
potentially disastrous consequences.
3.17. Therefore, we are no longer just
vulnerable to cyber harms caused by the
lack of cyber security on our own devices
but by threats to the interconnected
systems that are fundamental to our
society, health and welfare.

Poor cyber hygiene and compliance
3.18. Awareness of technical
vulnerabilities in software and networks,
and the need for cyber hygiene in the UK,
has undoubtedly increased over the past
five years. This is in part a consequence
of initiatives like the Government’s

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

‘10 Steps to Cyber Security’, but also due
to the increased public profile of major
cyber incidents affecting governments
and corporations. Cyber attacks are not
necessarily sophisticated or inevitable
and are often the result of exploited – but
easily rectifiable and, often, preventable –
vulnerabilities. In most cases, it continues
to be the vulnerability of the victim, rather
than the ingenuity of the attacker, that is
the deciding factor in the success of a
cyber attack. Businesses and organisations
decide on where and how to invest in
cyber security based on a cost-benefit
assessment, but they are ultimately liable
for the security of their data and systems.
Only by balancing the risk to their critical
systems and sensitive data from cyber
attacks, with sufficient investment in
people, technology and governance,
will businesses reduce their exposure to
potential cyber harm.

“There is no conceivable information
security system that can stop one
person out of a hundred opening a
phishing email, and that can be all
it takes.”
Ciaran Martin, Director General for
Cyber Security, GCHQ – June 2015
Insufficient training and skills
3.19. We lack the skills and
knowledge to meet our cyber security
needs across both the public and private
sector. In businesses, many staff
members are not cyber security
aware and do not understand their
responsibilities in this regard, partially
due to a lack of formal training. The public
is also insufficiently cyber aware.

23
Section 3
STRATEGIC CONTEXT

“Just under a fifth of businesses had
their staff take part in cyber security
training in the past year.”
Cyber Security Breaches Survey 2016.
3.20. We also need to develop the
specialist skills and capabilities that will
allow us to keep pace with rapidly evolving
technology and manage the associated
cyber risks. This skills gap represents a
national vulnerability that must be resolved.

Legacy and unpatched systems
3.21. Many organisations in the UK will
continue to use vulnerable legacy systems
until their next IT upgrade. Software on
these systems will often rely on older,
unpatched versions. These older versions
often suffer from vulnerabilities that
attackers look for and have the tools to
exploit. An additional issue is the use
by some organisations of unsupported
software, for which patching regimes do
not exist.

“We recently analysed 115,000 Cisco
devices on the Internet and across
customer environments as a way to
bring attention to the security risks
that aging infrastructure – and lack
of attention to patching vulnerabilities
present… We found that 106,000
of the 115,000 devices had known
vulnerabilities in the software they
were running.”
Cisco 2016 Annual Security Report

Availability of hacking resources
3.22. The ready availability of hacking
information and user-friendly hacking tools
on the Internet is enabling those who want
to develop a hacking capability to do so.
The information hackers need in order to
compromise victims successfully is often
openly accessible and can be harvested
quickly. Everyone, from the living room
to the boardroom, needs to be aware of
the extent of exposure of their personal
details and systems on the Internet, and
the degree to which that could leave them
vulnerable to malicious cyber exploitation.

“99.9% of exploited vulnerabilities
were compromised more than a year
after the vulnerability was published.”
Verizon 2015 Data Breach
Investigations report
CONCLUSIONS
3.23. The UK has pursued policies and
established institutions that have enhanced
our defences and mitigated some of the
threat we face in cyberspace.
3.24. However, we are not yet ahead of the
threat. The types of malicious cyber actors
we must contend with, and their motivations,
have largely endured, even as the volume of
malware and the numbers of such malicious
actors has grown rapidly. The capability of
our most technically proficient adversaries,
namely a select number of states and elite
cyber criminals, has grown. Our collective
challenge is to ensure our defences are
evolved and agile enough to counter them,
to reduce the ability of malicious actors to
attack us and to address the root causes of
the vulnerabilities outlined above.

RESPONSE

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

25
Section 4
OUR NATIONAL RESPONSE

4.1.
To mitigate the multiple threats
we face and safeguard our interests in
cyberspace, we need a strategic approach
that underpins all our collective and
individual actions in the digital domain over
the next five years. This section sets out
our vision and strategic approach.

OUR VISION
4.2.
Our vision for 2021 is that
the UK is secure and resilient to cyber
threats, prosperous and confident in
the digital world.
4.3.
To realise this vision, we will work to
achieve the following objectives:
•	 DEFEND We have the
means to defend the UK
against evolving cyber
threats, to respond
effectively to incidents,
and to ensure UK networks, data and
systems are protected and resilient.
Citizens, businesses and the public
sector have the knowledge and ability
to defend themselves.
•	 DETER The UK will be a
hard target for all forms of
aggression in cyberspace.
We detect, understand,
investigate and disrupt
hostile action taken against us,
pursuing and prosecuting offenders.
We have the means to take offensive
action in cyberspace, should we
choose to do so.
•	 DEVELOP We have
an innovative, growing
cyber security industry,
underpinned by worldleading scientific
research and development. We have
a self-sustaining pipeline of talent
providing the skills to meet our national

needs across the public and private
sectors. Our cutting-edge analysis
and expertise will enable the UK to
meet and overcome future threats
and challenges.
4.4.
Underpinning these objectives, we
will pursue INTERNATIONAL ACTION
and exert our influence by investing in
partnerships. We will shape the global
evolution of cyberspace in a manner
that advances our wider economic and
security interests.

PRINCIPLES
4.5
In working towards these objectives,
the Government will apply the following
principles:
•	 our actions and policies will be driven
by the need to both protect our people
and enhance our prosperity;
•	 we will treat a cyber attack on the UK
as seriously as we would an equivalent
conventional attack and we will defend
ourselves as necessary;
•	 we will act in accordance with national
and international law and expect others
to do the same;
•	 we will rigorously protect and promote
our core values. These include
democracy; the rule of law; liberty;
open and accountable governments
and institutions; human rights; and
freedom of expression;
•	 we will preserve and protect UK 

citizens’ privacy;

•	 we will work in partnership. Only
by working with the Devolved
Administrations, all parts of the public
sector, businesses, institutions, and the
individual citizen, can we successfully
secure the UK in cyberspace;
•	 the Government will meet its
responsibilities and lead the
national response, but businesses,
organisations and individual citizens

OUR NATIONAL RESPONSE

have a responsibility to take reasonable
steps to protect themselves online and
ensure they are resilient and able to
continue operating in the event of an
incident;
•	 responsibility for the security of
organisations across the public
sector, including cyber security
and the protection of online data
and services, lies with respective
Ministers, Permanent Secretaries and
Management Boards;
•	 we will not accept significant risk being
posed to the public and the country as
a whole as a result of businesses and
organisations failing to take the steps
needed to manage cyber threats;
•	 we will work closely with those
countries that share our views and
with whom our security overlaps,
recognising that cyber threats know
no borders. We will also work broadly
across the range of international
partners to influence the wider
community, acknowledging the value
of broad coalitions; and
•	 to ensure Government interventions are
having a substantive impact on overall
national cyber security and resilience,
we will seek to define, analyse and
present data which measures the state
of our collective cyber security and our
success in meeting our strategic goals.

to safeguard not only our hardware – our
smart phones and other devices – but also
the data, software and systems that afford
us freedom, flexibility and convenience in
our private and professional lives.

Businesses and organisations
4.8.
Businesses, public and private
sector organisations and other institutions
hold personal data, provide services,
and operate systems in the digital
domain. The connectivity of this
information has revolutionised their
operations. But with this technological
transformation comes the responsibility
to safeguard the assets which they hold,
maintain the services they provide, and
incorporate the appropriate level of
security into the products they sell. The
citizen and consumer, and society at large,
look to businesses and organisations to
take all reasonable steps to protect their
personal data, and build resilience – the
ability to withstand and recover – into the
systems and structures on which they
depend. Businesses and organisations
must also understand that, if they are the
victim of a cyber attack, they are liable for
the consequences.

Government

Individuals

4.9.
The primary duty of the Government
is to defend the country from attacks
by other states, to protect citizens and
the economy from harm, and to set the
domestic and international framework
to protect our interests, safeguard
fundamental rights, and bring criminals to
justice.

4.7.
As citizens, employees and
consumers, we take practical steps to
secure the assets we value in the physical
world. In the virtual world, we must do the
same. That means fulfilling our personal
responsibility to take all reasonable steps

4.10. As the holder of significant data and
a provider of services, the Government
takes stringent measures to provide
safeguards for its information assets.
The Government also has an important
responsibility to advise and inform citizens

ROLES AND RESPONSIBILITIES
4.6.
Securing the national cyberspace will
require a collective effort. Each and every
one of us has an important part to play.

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

OUR NATIONAL RESPONSE

and organisations what they need to do
to protect themselves online, and where
necessary, set the standards we expect key
companies and organisations to meet.
4.11. Although key sectors of our
economy are in private hands, the
Government is ultimately responsible for
assuring their national resilience and, with
its partners across the administration, the
maintenance of essential services and
functions across the whole of government.

Driving change: the role of the market
4.12. The 2011 Strategy and National
Cyber Security Programme sought to drive
outcomes and increase capacity in both
the public and private sector by looking to
the market to drive the right behaviours.
We expected commercial pressures
and government-instigated incentives to
ensure adequate business investment in
appropriate cyber security, to stimulate a
flow of investment into our industry, and to
encourage an adequate pipeline of skills
into the sector.
4.13. Much has been achieved. Across
the economy and wider society, awareness
of the risk and of the actions required to
mitigate cyber risk have increased over
the last five years. But the combination
of market forces and government
encouragement has not been sufficient in
itself to secure our long-term interests in
cyberspace at the pace required. Too many
networks, including in critical sectors, are
still insecure. The market is not valuing,
and therefore not managing, cyber risk
correctly. Too many organisations are still
suffering breaches at even the most basic
level. Too few investors are willing to risk
supporting entrepreneurs in the sector. Too
few graduates and others with the right
skills are emerging from the education and
training system.

4.14. The market still has a role to
play and in the longer term will deliver
greater impact than the Government
ever can. However, the immediacy of the
threat facing the UK and the expanding
vulnerabilities of our digitalised environment
call for greater action in the short term from
the Government.

Driving change: expanded role for the
Government
4.15. The Government must therefore set
the pace in meeting the country’s national
cyber security needs. Only Government
can draw on the intelligence and other
assets required to defend the country
from the most sophisticated threats.
Only Government can drive cooperation
across the public and private sectors and
ensure information is shared between the
two. Government has a leading role, in
consultation with industry, in defining what
good cyber security looks like and ensuring
it is implemented.
4.16. The Government will bring about
a significant improvement in our national
cyber security over the next five years. This
ambitious and transformational programme
will focus on the following four broad areas:
•	 Levers and incentives. The
Government will invest to maximise
the potential of a truly innovative
UK cyber sector. We will do this by
supporting start-ups and investing
in innovation. We will also seek to
identify and bring on talent earlier in the
education system and develop clearer
routes into a profession that needs
better definition. The Government will
also make use of all available levers,
including the forthcoming General Data
Protection Regulation (GDPR), to drive
up standards of cyber security across
the economy, including, if required,
through regulation.
National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

28
Section 4
OUR NATIONAL RESPONSE

•	 Expanded intelligence and law
enforcement focus on the threat.
The intelligence agencies, the Ministry
of Defence, the police and the National
Crime Agency, in coordination with
international partner agencies, will expand
their efforts to identify, anticipate and
disrupt hostile cyber activities by foreign
actors, cyber criminals and terrorists. This
will improve their intelligence collection
and exploitation, with the aim of obtaining
pre-emptive intelligence on the intent and
capabilities of our adversaries.
•	 Development and deployment of
technology in partnership with industry,
including Active Cyber Defence
measures, to deepen our understanding
of the threat, to strengthen the security
of the UK public and private sector
systems and networks in the face of that
threat, and to disrupt malicious activity.
•	 National Cyber Security Centre
(NCSC). The Government has
established a single, central body
for cyber security at a national level.
This body will manage national cyber
incidents, provide an authoritative
voice and centre of expertise on cyber
security, and deliver tailored support
and advice to departments, the
Devolved Administrations, regulators
and businesses. The NCSC will analyse,
detect and understand cyber threats,
and will also provide its cyber security
expertise to support the Government’s
efforts to foster innovation, support a
thriving cyber security industry, and
stimulate the development of cyber
security skills. Uniquely for such a publicfacing body, its parent body is GCHQ
and it can therefore draw on the worldclass expertise and sensitive capabilities
of that organisation, improving the
support it will be able to provide to the
economy and society more widely. It will
remain the responsibility of government
departments to ensure they effectively
implement this cyber security advice.
National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

“Given the industrial-scale theft
of intellectual property from our
companies and universities, as well as
the numerous phishing and malware
scams that waste time and money, the
National Cyber Security Centre shows
that the UK is focusing its efforts to
combat the threats that exist online.”
Robert Hannigan, Director GCHQ,
March 2016
4.17. Delivering these changes to our
cyber security and resilience will require
additional resources. In the Strategic
Defence and Security Review 2015, the
Government set aside £1.9 billion over the
five years of the strategy to deliver these
commitments and objectives.

29
Section 4
OUR NATIONAL RESPONSE

THE NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY CENTRE
The National Cyber Security Centre
(NCSC) launched on 1 October 2016. The
NCSC provides a unique opportunity to
build effective cyber security partnerships
between government, industry and the
public to ensure that the UK is safer
online. It will provide cyber incident
response and be the UK’s authoritative
voice on cyber security. For the first time,
key sectors will be able to engage directly
with NCSC staff to get the best possible
advice and support on securing networks
and systems from cyber threats.
The NCSC provides:
•	 a unified source of advice for
the Government’s cyber security
threat intelligence and information
assurance;
•	 the strong public face of the
Government’s action against cyber
threats – working hand in hand with
industry, academia and international
partners to keep the UK protected
against cyber attack; and
•	 a public-facing organisation with
reach back into GCHQ to draw on
necessarily secret intelligence and
world-class technical expertise.
There will be a phased approach to
building the NCSC’s capabilities over the
lifetime of this strategy. It brings together

the capabilities already developed by
CESG – the information security arm of
GCHQ – the Centre for the Protection of
National Infrastructure (CPNI), CERT-UK
(Computer Emergency Response Team)
and the Centre for Cyber Assessment
(CCA), enabling us to build on the best
of what we already have, whilst greatly
simplifying the former arrangements. Its
initial focus will be:
•	 a world class incident management
capability to respond to and reduce
the harm from cyber incidents –
from those affecting single
organisations through to national,
large scale attacks;
•	 providing communications on how
organisations in the public and private
sector can deal with cyber security
issues, facilitating the sharing of
cyber threat information; and
•	 continuing to provide expert

sectoral advice to Government 

and critical sectors like 

telecommunications, energy and 

finance, and providing cyber

security advice across the UK.

The NCSC offers an effective means for
the Government to deliver many elements
of this strategy. We recognise that, as the
NCSC grows, its focus and capabilities
will need to adapt to new challenges and
lessons learned.

Our goals for the country’s cyber security over the next five
years are rightly ambitious. To achieve them will require
us to act with consequence and determination across the
digital landscape. Activity to deliver the Government’s vision
will advance the three primary objectives of the strategy:
to DEFEND our cyberspace, to DETER our adversaries and
to DEVELOP our capabilities, all underpinned by effective
INTERNATIONAL ACTION.

DEFEND

5. DEFEND

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

33
Section 5
DEFEND

5.0.1. The DEFEND elements of this
strategy aim to ensure that UK networks,
data and systems in the public, commercial
and private spheres are resilient to and
protected from cyber attack. It will never
be possible to stop every cyber attack, just
as it is not possible to stop every crime.
However, together with citizens, education
providers, academia, businesses and other
governments, the UK can build layers of
defence that will significantly reduce our
exposure to cyber incidents, protect our
most precious assets, and allow us all to
operate successfully and prosperously in
cyberspace. Acting to promote cooperation
between states and good cyber security
practice is also in the interest of our
collective security.
5.0.2. The Government will implement
measures to ensure that citizens,
businesses, public and private sector
organisations and institutions have
access to the right information to defend
themselves. The National Cyber Security
Centre provides a unified source of advice
in government for threat intelligence
and information assurance, ensuring
that we can offer tailored guidance for
cyber defence and respond quickly and
effectively to major incidents in cyberspace.
The Government will work with industry
and international partners to define what
good cyber security looks like for public
and private sectors, for our most important
systems and services, and for the economy
as a whole. We will build security by
default into all new government and critical
systems. Law enforcement agencies will
collaborate closely with industry and the
National Cyber Security Centre to provide
dynamic criminal threat intelligence with
which industry can better defend itself,
and to promote protective security advice
and standards.

5.1.

ACTIVE CYBER DEFENCE

5.1.1. Active Cyber Defence (ACD) is the
principle of implementing security measures
to strengthen a network or system to
make it more robust against attack. In a
commercial context, Active Cyber Defence
normally refers to cyber security analysts
developing an understanding of the threats
to their networks, and then devising and
implementing measures to proactively
combat, or defend, against those threats. In
the context of this strategy, the Government
has chosen to apply the same principle on
a larger scale: the Government will use its
unique expertise, capabilities and influence
to bring about a step-change in national
cyber security to respond to cyber threats.
The ‘network’ we are attempting to defend
is the entire UK cyberspace. The activities
proposed represent a defensive action plan,
drawing on the expertise of NCSC as the
National Technical Authority to respond to
cyber threats to the UK at a macro level.

Objectives
5.1.2. In undertaking ACD, the Government
aims to:
•	 make the UK a much harder target
for state sponsored actors and cyber
criminals by increasing the resilience of
UK networks;
•	 defeat the vast majority of highvolume/low-sophistication malware
activity on UK networks by blocking
malware communications between
hackers and their victims;
•	 evolve and increase the scope and
scale of Government’s capabilities to
disrupt serious state sponsored and
cyber criminal threats;
•	 secure our internet and 

telecommunications traffic from 

hijacking by malicious actors;


National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

34
Section 5
DEFEND

•	 harden the UK’s critical infrastructure
and citizen-facing services against
cyber threats; and
•	 disrupt the business model of attackers
of every type, to demotivate them and
to reduce the harm that their attacks
can cause.

Approach
5.1.3. In pursuit of these aims, the
Government will:
•	 work with industry, especially
Communications Service Providers
(CSPs), to make it significantly harder
to attack UK internet services and
users, and greatly reduce the prospect
of attacks having a sustained impact
on the UK. This will include tackling
phishing, blocking malicious domains
and IP addresses, and other steps to
disrupt malware attacks. It will also
include measures to secure the UK’s
telecommunications and internet
routing infrastructure;
•	 increase the scale and development
of GCHQ, Ministry of Defence and
NCA capabilities to disrupt the most
serious cyber threats to the
UK, including campaigns by
sophisticated cyber criminals and
hostile foreign actors; and
•	 better protect government systems
and networks, help industry build
greater security into the CNI supply
chain, make the software ecosystem
in the UK more secure, and provide
automated protections for government
online services to the citizen.

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

5.1.4. Where possible, these initiatives will
be delivered with or through partnerships
with industry. For many, industry will be
designing and leading implementation,
with the Government’s critical contribution
being expert support, advice and
thought-leadership.
5.1.5. The Government will also undertake
specific actions to implement these
measures, which will include:
•	 working with CSPs to block malware
attacks. We will do this by restricting
access to specific domains or web
sites that are known sources of
malware. This is known as Domain
Name System (DNS) blocking / filtering;
•	 preventing phishing activity that
relies on domain ‘spoofing’ (where an
email appears to be from a specific
sender, such as a bank or government
department, but is actually fraudulent)
by deploying an email verification
system on government networks as
standard and encouraging industry to
do likewise;
•	 promoting security best practice
through multi-stakeholder internet
governance organisations such as
the Internet Corporation for Assigned
Names and Numbers (ICANN)
which coordinates the domain name
system), the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) and the European
Regional Internet Registry (RIPE) and
engagement with stakeholders in the
UN Internet Governance Forum (IGF);
•	 working with law enforcement channels
in order to protect UK citizens from
being targeted in cyber attacks from
unprotected infrastructure overseas;

35
Section 5
DEFEND

•	 working towards the implementation
of controls to secure the routing
of internet traffic for government
departments to ensure that it cannot
be illegitimately re-routed by malicious
actors; and
•	 investing in programmes in the Ministry
of Defence, the NCA and GCHQ that
will enhance the capabilities of these
organisations to respond to, and
disrupt, serious state-sponsored and
criminal cyber activity targeting UK
networks.
We will develop these technical
interventions as threats evolve to ensure
that UK citizens and businesses are
protected by default from the majority of
large-scale commodity cyber attacks.

Measuring success
5.1.6. The Government will measure its
success in establishing effective ACD
by assessing progress towards the
following outcomes:
•	 the UK is harder to ‘phish’, because we
have large-scale defences against the
use of malicious domains, more active
anti-phishing protection at scale and
it is much harder to use other forms
of communication, such as ‘vishing’
and SMS spoofing, to conduct social
engineering attacks;
•	 a far larger proportion of malware
communications and technical
artefacts associated with cyber attacks
and exploitation are being blocked;
•	 the UK’s internet and
telecommunications traffic is
significantly less vulnerable to rerouting
by malicious actors;
•	 GCHQ, the Armed Forces’ and NCA
capabilities to respond to serious statesponsored and criminal threats have
significantly increased.

5.2.	 BUILDING A MORE SECURE
INTERNET
5.2.1. Changing technology provides us
with the opportunity to significantly reduce
the ability of our adversaries to conduct
cyber crime in the UK by ensuring that
future online products and services coming
into use are ‘secure by default’. That means
ensuring that the security controls built
into the software and hardware we use
are activated as a default setting by the
manufacturer so that the user experiences
the maximum security offered to them,
unless they actively choose to turn it off.
The challenge is to effect transformative
change in a way that supports the end
user and offers a commercially viable, but
secure, product or service – all within the
context of maintaining the free and open
nature of the Internet.

“Internet-connected things are
multiplying rapidly. We saw many
proof-of-concept and real world
attacks in 2015, identifying serious
vulnerabilities in cars, medical devices
and more. Manufacturers need to
prioritise security to reduce the risk
of serious personal, economic and
social consequences.”
Symantec 2016 Internet Security
Threat Report

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

36
Section 5
DEFEND

5.2.2. The Government is well-placed
to take a lead role in exploring those
new technologies that will better protect
our own systems, help industry build
greater security into the supply chain,
secure the software ecosystem and
provide automated protections to citizens
accessing government services online.
The Government must test and implement
new technologies that provide automated
protection for government online products
and services. Where possible, similar
technologies should be offered to the
private sector and the citizen.

Objective
5.2.3. The majority of online products
and services coming into use become
‘secure by default’ by 2021. Consumers
will be empowered to choose products
and services that have built-in security as
a default setting. Individuals can switch off
these settings if they choose to do so but
those consumers who wish to engage in
cyberspace in the most secure way will be
automatically protected.

Our approach
5.2.4. We will pursue the following actions:
•	 the Government will lead by example
by running secure services on the
Internet that do not rely on the Internet
itself being secure;
•	 the Government will explore options for
collaboration with industry to develop
cutting-edge ways to make hardware and
software more ‘secure by default’; and
•	 we will adopt challenging new cyber
security technologies in government,
encouraging Devolved Administrations
to do likewise, in order to reduce
perceived risks of adoption. This
will provide proof of concept and
demonstrate the security benefits of
new technologies and approaches.
National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

It will also put security at the heart of
new product development, eliminate
opportunities for criminal exploitation
and thereby protect the end user.
5.2.5. To do this we will:
•	 continue to encourage hardware and
software providers to sell products with
security settings activated as default,
requiring the user to actively disable
these settings to make them insecure.
Some vendors are already doing this,
but some are not yet taking these
necessary steps;
•	 continue to develop an Internet
Protocol (IP) reputation service to
protect government digital services
(this would allow online services to
get information about an IP address
connecting to them, helping the service
make more informed risk management
decisions in real time);
•	 seek to install products on government
networks that will provide assurance
that software is running correctly, and
not being maliciously interfered with;
•	 look to expand beyond the GOV.UK
domain into other digital services
measures that notify users who are
running out-of-date browsers; and
•	 invest in technologies like Trusted
Platform Modules (TPM) and emerging
industry standards such as Fast
Identity Online (FIDO), which do not rely
on passwords for user authentication,
but use the machine and other
devices in the user’s possession to
authenticate. The Government will test
innovative authentication mechanisms
to demonstrate what they can offer,
both in terms of security and overall
user experience.
5.2.6. The Government will also explore
how to encourage the market by providing
security ratings for new products, so that
consumers have clear information on

37
Section 5
DEFEND

which products and services offer them
the greatest security. The Government
will also explore how to link these product
ratings to new and existing regulators, and
ways to warn consumers when they are
about to take an action online that might
compromise their security.

Measuring success
5.2.7. The Government will measure
its success in building a secure Internet
by assessing progress towards the
following outcomes:
•	 the majority of commodity products and
services available in the UK in 2021 are
making the UK more secure because
they have their default security settings
enabled by default or have security
integrated into their design; and
•	 all government services provided
at national, local and Devolved
Administration level are trusted by the
UK public because they have been
implemented as securely as possible,
and fraud levels are within acceptable
risk parameters.

5.3.

PROTECTING GOVERNMENT

5.3.1. The UK Government, Devolved
Administrations and the wider public sector
hold large quantities of sensitive data. They
deliver essential services to the public and
operate networks that are critical to national
security and resilience. The Government’s
systems underpin the functioning of our
society. The modernisation of public
sector services will continue to be the
cornerstone of the UK’s Digital Strategy –
the Government’s digital ambition is for the
UK to be the world’s leading digital nation.
To retain the trust of citizens in online public
sector services and systems, data held
by government must be protected and all
branches of government must implement
appropriate levels of cyber security in the

face of continuous attempts by hostile
actors to gain access to government and
public sector networks and data.

Objectives
5.3.2. We want to achieve the following
outcomes:
•	 citizens use government online services
with confidence: they trust that their
sensitive information is safe and, in
turn, understand their responsibility to
submit their sensitive information online
in a secure manner;
•	 the Government will set and adhere to
the most appropriate cyber security
standards, to ensure that all branches
of government understand and meet
their obligations to secure their
networks, data and services; and
•	 the Government’s critical assets, 

including those at the highest 

classification, are protected from

cyber attacks. 


Our approach
5.3.3. The UK Government will continue to
move more of its services online so that the
UK can become truly ‘digital by default’.
The Government Digital Service (GDS),
the Crown Commercial Service (CCS) and
the NCSC will ensure that all new digital
services built or procured by government
are also ‘secure by default’.
5.3.4. The Government’s networks are
highly complex and in many cases still
incorporate legacy systems, as well as
some commercially available software
which is no longer supported by the
vendor. We will ensure that there are no
unmanaged risks from legacy systems and
unsupported software.
5.3.5. We will improve government and
wider public sector resilience to cyber

attack. This means ensuring an accurate
and up to date knowledge of all systems,
data, and those who have access to them.
The likelihood and impact of a cyber
incident will be minimised by implementing
best practice as set out by the NCSC.
The Government will also ensure that it
is able to respond effectively to cyber
incidents through a programme of incident
exercises and regular testing of government
networks. We will invite Devolved
Administrations and local authorities
to participate in these exercises, as
appropriate. Through automated scanning,
we will ensure that we have a better
knowledge of government’s online security
status.
5.3.6. Cyber security is not just about
technology. Almost all successful cyber
attacks have a contributing human factor.
We will therefore continue to invest in our
people, to ensure that everyone who works
in government has a sound awareness of
cyber risk. We will develop specific cyber
expertise in areas where the risks are
heightened and ensure that we have the
right processes in place to manage these
risks effectively.
5.3.7. The NCSC will develop worldleading cyber security guidance which will
keep pace with the threat and development
of new technologies. We will take steps to
make sure government organisations have
easy access to threat information to inform
their understanding of their own cyber risks
and take appropriate action.
5.3.8. We will continue to improve
our highest classification networks to
safeguard the Government’s most sensitive
communications.
5.3.9. Health and care systems pose unique
challenges in the context of cyber security.
The sector employs around 1.6 million
people in over 40,000 organisations, each
National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

with vastly differing information security
resources and capability. The National Data
Guardian for Health and Care has set new
data security standards for the health and
social care systems in England, alongside
a new data consent/opt-out model for
patients. The Government will work with
health and social care organisations to
implement these standards.

“Britain is a world leader in cyber
security, but with growing threats,
this new Cyber Security Operations
Centre will ensure our Armed forces
continue to operate securely. Our
increasing defence budget means that
we can stay ahead of our adversaries
in cyberspace while also investing in
conventional capabilities”
The Rt Hon Michael Fallon MP,
Defence Secretary, April 2016
5.3.10. Cyber security is vital to our defence.
Our Armed Forces depend on information
and communications systems, both in the
UK and on operations around the world. The
infrastructure and personnel of the Ministry
of Defence (MoD) are prominent targets.
Defence systems are regularly targeted by
criminals, foreign intelligence services and
other malicious actors seeking to exploit
personnel, disrupt business and operations,
and corrupt and steal information. We
will enhance cyber threat awareness,
detection, and reaction functions, through
the development of a Cyber Security
Operations Centre (CSOC) that uses stateof-the-art defensive cyber capabilities to
protect the MoD’s cyberspace and deal with
threats. The CSOC will work closely with the
NCSC to confront the MoD’s cyber security
challenges and contribute to wider national
cyber security.

39

Measuring success
5.3.11. The Government will measure
its success in protecting government
networks, systems and data by assessing
progress towards the following outcomes:
•	 the Government has an in-depth 

understanding of the level of cyber 

security risk across the whole of 

government and the wider public 

sector;

•	 individual government departments
and other bodies protect themselves
in proportion to their level of risk and
to an agreed government minimum
standard;
•	 government departments and the wider
public sector are resilient and can
respond effectively to cyber incidents,
maintaining functions and recovering
quickly;
•	 new technologies and digital services
deployed by government will be cyber
secure by default;

•	 we are aware of, and actively
mitigating, all known internet-facing
vulnerabilities in government systems
and services; and
•	 all suppliers to the Government meet
appropriate cyber security standards.

5.4.	 PROTECTING OUR CRITICAL
NATIONAL INFRASTRUCTURE AND
OTHER PRIORITY SECTORS
Context
5.4.1 The cyber security of certain UK
organisations is of particular importance
because a successful cyber attack on
them would have the severest impact on
the country’s national security. This impact
could have a bearing on the lives of UK
citizens, the stability and strength of the
UK economy, or the UK’s international
standing and reputation. This premium
group of companies and organisations
within the public and private sector
includes the critical national infrastructure

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

40
Section 5
DEFEND

(CNI), which provides essential services
to the nation. Ensuring the CNI is secure
and resilient against cyber attack will be a
priority for the Government. This premium
group also includes other companies and
organisations, beyond the CNI, that require
a greater level of support. They include:
•	 the jewels in our economic crown –
the UK’s most successful companies
and also those that hold our future
economic strength in the value of their
research and intellectual property;
•	 data holders – not just organisations
that hold large amounts of personal
data, but also those that hold data on
vulnerable citizens here and abroad,
such as charities;
•	 high-threat targets – such as media
organisations, where an attack could
harm the UK’s reputation, damage
public confidence in the Government,
or endanger freedom of expression;
•	 the touchstones of our digital economy
– digital service providers that enable
e-commerce and our digital economy,
and who depend on consumer trust in
their services; and
•	 those organisations that, through
market forces and authority, can exert
influence on the whole economy to
improve their cyber security, such as
insurers, investors, regulators and
professional advisors.
5.4.2. More needs to be done to protect
these vital parts of our economy and
support the organisations that heavily
influence others. Our CNI – in both the
private and public sector – continues to
be a target for attack. Across these and
many other priority sectors cyber risk is
still not properly understood or managed,
even as the threat continues to diversify
and increase.

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

Objective
5.4.3. the UK Government, working
with the Devolved Administrations and
other responsible authorities where
appropriate, will ensure that the UK’s
most important organisations and
companies, including the CNI, are
sufficiently secure and resilient in the
face of cyber attack. Neither the
Government nor other public bodies will
take on the responsibility to manage this
risk for the private sector, which rightly
sits with boards, owners and operators.
But the Government will provide support
and assurance proportionate both to the
threat these companies and organisations
face, and to the consequences of their
being attacked.

“Cyber security is key to unlocking
innovation and expansion, and by
adopting a tailored organisation
and risk-centric approach to cyber
security, organisations can refocus on
opportunities and exploration. Building
trust in a business that operates
successfully within the Internet of
Things (IoT), and that fully supports and
protects individuals and their personal
mobile devices (from a simple phone
to a health care device, from smart
appliances to smart cars), is a key
competitive differentiator and must be
a priority.”
EY’s Global Information Security
Survey 2015

Section 5
DEFEND

Our approach
5.4.4. Organisations and company
boards are responsible for ensuring their
networks are secure. They must identify
critical systems and regularly assess
their vulnerability against an evolving
technological landscape and threat.
They must invest in technology and their
staff to reduce vulnerabilities in current
and future systems, and in their supply
chain, to maintain a level of cyber security
proportionate to the risk. They must also
have tested capabilities in place to respond
if an attack happens. For the CNI, they
must do this with government bodies and
regulators so we can be confident that
cyber risk is being properly managed and
– if it is not – intervene in the interests of
national security.
5.4.5. The Government will, therefore,
understand the level of cyber security
across our CNI and have measures in
place to intervene where necessary
to drive improvements that are in the
national interest.
5.4.6. The Government will:
•	 share threat information with industry
that only the Government can obtain
so they know what they must protect
themselves against;
•	 produce advice and guidance on how
to manage cyber risk and, working
collaboratively with industry and
academia, define what good cyber
security looks like;
•	 stimulate the introduction of the highend security needed to protect the CNI,
such as training facilities, testing labs,
security standards and consultancy
services; and
•	 conduct exercises with CNI companies
to assist them in managing their cyber
risks and vulnerabilities.

5.4.7. The NCSC will provide these services
for the UK’s most important companies
and organisations, including the CNI. It will
do so in partnership with departments and
regulators, who will assure whether cyber
risk is being managed in their sectors to the
level demanded by the national interest.
5.4.8. The Government will also make
sure that the right regulatory framework for
cyber security is in place, one that:
•	 ensures industry acts to protect itself
from the threat;
•	 is outcome focused and sufficiently
flexible so that it will not fall behind the
threat, or lead to compliance rather
than sound risk management;
•	 is agile enough to foster growth and
innovation, rather than lead it;
•	 is harmonised with regimes in other
jurisdictions so that UK companies
do not suffer from a fragmented and
burdensome approach; and
•	 delivers, when combined with
effective support from the Government,
a competitive advantage for the UK.
5.4.9. Many of our industry sectors
are already regulated for cyber security.
Nonetheless, we must ensure the right
steps are taken across the whole
economy, including the CNI, to manage
cyber security risks.

Measuring success
5.4.10. The Government will measure its
success in protecting our CNI and other
priority sectors by assessing progress
towards the following outcomes:
•	 we understand the level of cyber
security across the CNI, and have
measures in place to intervene, where
necessary, to drive improvements in
the national interest; and

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

•	 our most important companies and
organisations understand the level of
threat and implement proportionate
cyber security practices.

5.5.	 CHANGING PUBLIC AND BUSINESS
BEHAVIOURS
5.5.1 A successful UK digital economy
relies upon the confidence of businesses
and the public in online services. The UK
The Government has worked with industry
and other parts of the public sector to
increase awareness and understanding
of the threat. The Government has also
provided the public and business with
access to some of the tools that they
need to protect themselves. While there
are many organisations that are doing an
excellent job – in places, world-leading – of
protecting themselves, and in providing
services to others online, the majority of
businesses and individuals are still not
properly managing cyber risk.

“Last year, the average cost of breaches
to large businesses that had them was
£36,500. For small firms the average
cost of breaches was £3,100. 65% of
large organisations reported they had
suffered an information security breach
in the past year, and 25% of these
experienced a breach at least once a
month. Nearly seven out of ten attacks
involved viruses, spyware or malware
that might have been prevented using the
Government’s Cyber Essentials scheme.”

and Cyber Security Breaches Survey

Objective
5.5.2. Our objective is to ensure that
individuals and organisations, regardless of
size or sector, are taking appropriate steps
to protect themselves, and their customers,
from the harm caused by cyber attacks.

Our approach
5.5.3. The Government will provide the
advice that the economy needs to protect
itself. We will improve how this advice is
delivered to maximise its effect. For the
public, the Government will harness ‘trusted
voices’ to increase the reach, credibility and
relevance of our message. We will provide
advice that is easy to act upon and relevant
to individuals, at the point they are accessing
services and exposing themselves to risk.
We will involve the Devolved Administrations
and other authorities as appropriate.
5.5.4. For businesses, we will work through
organisations such as insurers, regulators
and investors which can exert influence over
companies to ensure they manage cyber
risk. In doing so, we will highlight the clear
business benefits and the pricing of cyber
risk by market influencers. We will seek to
understand better why many organisations
still fail to protect themselves adequately and
then work in partnership with organisations
such as professional standards bodies, to
move beyond raising awareness to persuade
companies to take action. We will also make
sure we have the right regulatory framework
in place to manage those cyber risks the
market fails to address. As part of this, we
will seek to use levers, such as the GDPR,
to drive up standards of cyber security and
protect citizens.
5.5.5. Individuals and organisations and
organisations in the UK will have access to
the information, education, and tools they
need to protect themselves. To ensure we
deliver a step-change in public behaviour,

43
Section 5
DEFEND

we will maintain a coherent and consistent
set of messages on cyber security guidance
from both the Government and our partners.
The NCSC will provide technical advice to
underpin this guidance. It will reflect business
and public priorities and practices, and
be clear, easily accessible and consistent,
while keeping pace with the threat. Law
enforcement will work closely with industry
and the NCSC to share the latest criminal
threat intelligence, to support industry to
defend itself against threats, and to mitigate
the impact of attacks on UK victims.

Measuring success
5.5.6. The Government will measure its
success in protecting our CNI and other

CYBER AWARE
The Cyber Aware campaign, formerly
Cyber Streetwise, gives the public the
advice they need to protect themselves
from cyber criminals. Targeted messaging
delivered through social media and
advertising and in partnership with
businesses promotes:
•	 using three random words to create a
strong password; and
•	 always downloading the latest 

software updates.

Experts agree adopting these
behaviours will provide small businesses
and individuals with protection
against cyber crime. Cyber Aware
is currently supported by 128 crosssector partners, including the police
and businesses in the retail, leisure,
travel and professional services sectors.
In 2015/16 an estimated 10 million
adults and 1 million small businesses
stated they were more likely to maintain

priority sectors by assessing progress
towards the following outcomes:
•	 the UK economy’s level of cyber
security is as high as, or higher than,
comparative advanced economies;
•	 the number, severity and impact of
successful cyber attacks against
businesses in the UK has reduced,
because cyber hygiene standards
have improved; and
•	 there is an improving cyber
security culture across the UK
because organisations and the
public understand their cyber risk
levels and understand the cyber
hygiene steps they need to take to
manage those risks.

CYBER ESSENTIALS
The Cyber Essentials scheme was
developed to show organisations how
to protect themselves against low-level
“commodity threat”. It lists five technical
controls (access control; boundary
firewalls and Internet gateways; malware
protection; patch management and
secure configuration) that organisations
should have in place. The vast
majority of cyber attacks use relatively
simple methods which exploit basic
vulnerabilities in software and computer
systems. There are tools and techniques
openly available on the Internet
which enable even low-skill actors to
exploit these vulnerabilities. Properly
implementing the Cyber Essentials
scheme will protect against the vast
majority of common internet threats.

DEFEND

5.6.	 MANAGING INCIDENTS AND
UNDERSTANDING THE THREAT
5.6.1. The number and severity of cyber
incidents affecting organisations across
the public and private sector are likely
to increase. We therefore need to define
how both the private sector and the public
engage with the Government during a
cyber incident. We will ensure that the
UK Government’s level of support for
each sector – taking into account its
cyber maturity – is clearly defined and
understood. The Government’s collection
and dissemination of information about
the threat must be delivered in a manner
and at a speed suitable for all types
of organisation. The private sector,
government and the public can currently
access multiple sources of information,
guidance and assistance on cyber security.
This must be simplified.
5.6.2. We must ensure that the
Government offering, both in response
to incidents, and in the provision of
guidance, does not exist in isolation, but
in partnership with the private sector. Our
incident management processes should
reflect a holistic approach to incidents,
whereby we learn from partners and
share mitigation techniques. We will also
continue to use our relationships with other
Computer Emergency Response Teams
(CERTs) and our allies as an integrated part
of our incident management function.
5.6.3. Current incident management
remains somewhat fragmented across
government departments and this strategy
will create a unified approach. The NCSC
will deliver a streamlined and effective
government-led incident response function.
In the event of a serious cyber incident,
we will ensure that the Armed Forces are
able to provide assistance, whether in a
conventional form addressing the physical
impact of an incident, or in the form of
National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

specialist support from regular or reserve
cyber personnel. While we will provide
all the support our resources will allow,
the Government continues to stress the
importance of industry, society and the
public acting to safeguard their basic
cyber security.

Objectives
5.6.4.	 Our objectives are as follows:
•	 the Government will provide a single,
joined-up approach to incident
management, based on an improved
understanding and awareness of the
threat and actions being taken against
us. The NCSC will be a key enabler, as
will partnership with the private sector,
law enforcement and other government
departments, authorities and agencies;
•	 the NCSC defines clear processes
for reporting incidents, tailored to the
profile of the victim; and
•	 we will prevent the most common 

cyber incidents, and we will have 

effective information-sharing

structures in place to inform

‘pre-incident’ planning.


Our approach
5.6.5. It is the responsibility of organisation
and company management, in both the
public and private sector, to ensure their
networks are secure and to exercise
incident response plans. In the event of
a significant incident, the Government
incident management process will reflect
the three distinct elements of a cyber
incident: the precursor causes, the incident
itself and the post-incident response.
5.6.6. To deliver incident management
that is effective for both government
and the private sector, we will work
closely to review and define the scope
of the Government response to ensure it

45
Section 5
DEFEND

reinforces cooperation. We will build on
our national cyber exercise plan, using our
improved understanding and awareness of
the threat, to improve our offer of support
to public and private sector partners.
5.6.7. We will create a trusted and credible
government identity for incident advice,
assistance and assurance. This will increase
the cyber security awareness across the
UK digital community and will enable us
the better to identify trends, take pro-active
measures and, ultimately, prevent incidents.
5.6.8. In moving towards automated
information sharing (i.e. cyber security
systems automatically alerting each other
to incidents or attacks), we will deliver
a more effective service. This will allow
organisations to act swiftly on relevant
threat information.

Measuring success
5.6.9. The Government will measure
its success in managing incidents by
assessing progress towards the following
outcomes:
•	 a higher proportion of incidents are
reported to the authorities, leading to
a better understanding of the size and
scale of the threat;
•	 cyber incidents are managed
more effectively, efficiently and
comprehensively, as a result of the
creation of the NCSC as a centralised
incident reporting and response
mechanism; and
•	 we will address the root causes of
attacks at a national level, reducing the
occurrence of repeated exploitation
across multiple victims and sectors.

6.0.1. The National Security Strategy states
that defence and protection start with
deterrence. This is as true in cyberspace
as any other sphere. To realise our vision
of a nation that is secure and resilient
to cyber threats, and prosperous and
confident in the digital world, we have
to dissuade and deter those who would
harm us and our interests. To achieve
this we all need to continue to raise levels
of cyber security so that attacking us in
cyberspace – whether to steal from us or
harm us – is neither cheap nor easy. Our
adversaries must know that they cannot act
with impunity: that we can and will identify
them, and that we can act against them,
using the most appropriate response from
amongst all the tools at our disposal. We
will continue to build global alliances and
promote the application of international law
in cyberspace. We will also more actively
disrupt the activity of all those who threaten
us in cyberspace and the infrastructure on
which they rely. Delivering this ambition
requires world-class sovereign capabilities.

6.1.

CYBER’S ROLE IN DETERRENCE

6.1.1. Cyberspace is only one sphere in
which we must defend our interests and
sovereignty. Just as our actions in the
physical sphere are relevant to our cyber
security and deterrence, so our actions and
posture in cyberspace must contribute to
our wider national security.
6.1.2. The principles of deterrence are as
applicable in cyberspace as they are in the
physical sphere. The UK makes clear that
the full spectrum of our capabilities will be
used to deter adversaries and to deny them
opportunities to attack us. However, we
recognise that cyber security and resilience
are in themselves a means of deterring
attacks that rely on the exploitation of
vulnerabilities.

6.1.3. We will pursue a comprehensive
national approach to cyber security and
deterrence that will make the UK a harder
target, reducing the benefits and raising the
costs to an adversary – be they political,
diplomatic, economic or strategic. We must
ensure our capability and intent to respond
are understood by potential adversaries in
order to influence their decision-making.
We shall have the tools and capabilities
we need: to deny our adversaries easy
opportunities to compromise our networks
and systems; to understand their intent and
capabilities; to defeat commodity malware
threats at scale; and to respond and
protect the nation in cyberspace.

6.2.

REDUCING CYBER CRIME

6.2.1. We need to raise the cost, raise
the risk, and reduce the reward of cyber
criminals’ activity. While we must harden
the UK against cyber attacks and reduce
vulnerabilities, we must also focus
relentlessly on pursuing criminals who
continue to target the UK.
6.2.2. Law enforcement agencies will
focus their efforts on pursuing the criminals
who persist in attacking UK citizens and
businesses. We will work with domestic
and international partners to target
criminals wherever they are located, and to
dismantle their infrastructure and facilitation
networks. Law enforcement agencies will
also continue to help raise awareness and
standards of cyber security, in collaboration
with the NCSC.

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

DETER

6.2.3. This strategy complements the
2013 Serious and Organised Crime
Strategy, which set out the UK
Government’s strategic response to
cyber crime, alongside other types of
serious and organised crime. The National
Cyber Crime Unit (NCCU) that sits within
the National Crime Agency (NCA) was
established to lead and coordinate the
national response to cyber crime. Action
Fraud provides a national reporting centre
for fraud and cyber crime. A network
of cyber crime units within Regional
Organised Crime Units (ROCUs) provide
access to specialist cyber capabilities at
a regional level, supporting the NCCU
and local forces.

Objective
6.2.4. We will reduce the impact of cyber
crime on the UK and its interests by
deterring cyber criminals from targeting the
UK and relentlessly pursuing those who
persist in attacking us.

Our approach
6.2.5. To reduce the impact of cyber crime,
we will:
•	 enhance the UK’s law enforcement
capabilities and skills at national,
regional and local level to identify,
pursue, prosecute and deter cyber
criminals within the UK and overseas;
•	 build a better understanding of the
cyber crime business model, so we
know where to target interventions in
order to have the most disruptive effect
on criminal activity. We will use this
knowledge to:
- make the UK a high-cost, high-risk
environment in which to operate by
targeting the UK nexus of criminality,
and by working with industry to
reduce the ability of criminals to
National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

exploit UK infrastructure; and
- tackle cyber crime upstream, adding
friction to the criminal business model
by dismantling their infrastructure
and financial networks, and wherever
possible, bringing offenders to justice.
•	 build international partnerships to
end the perceived impunity of cyber
criminals acting against the UK,
by bringing criminals in overseas
jurisdictions to justice;
•	 deter individuals from being attracted
to, or becoming involved in, cyber
crime by building on our early
intervention measures;
•	 enhance collaborations with industry to
provide them with proactive intelligence
on the threat, and to provide us with
the upstream intelligence that they
possess, in order to assist with our
upstream disruption efforts;
•	 develop a new 24/7 reporting and
triage capability in Action Fraud, linked
to the NCSC, the NCA’s National
Cyber Crime Unit and the wider law
enforcement community, to improve
support to victims of cyber crime, to
provide a faster response to reported
crimes and enhanced protective
security advice. A new reporting system
will be established to share information
in real time across law enforcement on
cyber crime and threats;
•	 work with the NCSC and the private
sector to reduce vulnerabilities in UK
infrastructure that could be exploited at
scale by cyber criminals; and
•	 work with the finance sector to make
the UK a more hostile environment
for those seeking to monetise stolen
credentials, including by disrupting
their networks.

6.2.6. The Government will measure its
success in reducing cyber crime by assessing
progress towards the following outcomes:
•	 we have a greater disruptive effect
on cyber criminals attacking the UK,
with higher numbers of arrests and
convictions, and larger numbers of
criminal networks dismantled as a
result of law enforcement intervention;
•	 there is improved law enforcement
capability, including greater capacity
and skills of dedicated specialists and
mainstream officers and enhanced
law enforcement capability amongst
overseas partners;
•	 there is improved effectiveness and
increased scale of early intervention
measures dissuades and reforms
offenders; and
•	 there are fewer low-level cyber
offences as a result of cyber criminal
services being harder to access and
less effective.

WHAT TO DO IF YOU ARE A VICTIM OF 

CYBER CRIME 

If you are a member of the public and
you believe that you are the victim of
cyber crime, or cyber enabled fraud, you
should contact Action Fraud.
You can report the incident using Action
Fraud’s online fraud reporting tool
anytime of the day or night, or call 0300
123 2040. For further information see
www.actionfraud.police.uk
The Action Fraud service is run by the 

City of London Police.


6.3.	 COUNTERING HOSTILE FOREIGN
ACTORS
6.3.1. We need to bring to bear the full
range of government capabilities to counter
the threat posed by hostile foreign actors
that increasingly threaten our political,
economic and military security. Working
with international partners will be key to
our success, and greater emphasis will
be placed on engaging them and working
with them to counter the threat. Much of
this action will not be in the public domain.
Our investment in sovereign capabilities
and partnerships with industry and the
private sector will continue to underpin our
ability to detect, observe and identify this
constantly evolving activity against us.

Objective
6.3.2. We will have strategies, policies
and priorities in place for each adversary,
to ensure a proactive, well-calibrated and
effective approach is taken to counter the
threat and in order to drive down the number
and severity of cyber incidents in the future.

Our approach
6.3.3. To reduce the cyber threat from
hostile foreign actors, we will:
•	 reinforce the application of
international law in cyberspace in
addition to promoting the agreement
of voluntary, non-binding norms of
responsible state behaviour and the
development and implementation of
confidence building measures;
•	 work with international partners,
particularly through collective defence,
cooperative security, and enhanced
deterrence that our membership of
NATO affords;
•	 identify both the unique and

generic aspects of our adversaries’ 

cyber activity;

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

50
Section 6
DETER

•	 generate and explore all available
options for deterring and countering
this threat, drawing on the full range of
government capabilities. We will take
full account of other related factors,
including country-specific strategies,
international cyber priorities, and cyber
crime and prosperity objectives;
•	 use existing networks and relationships
with our key international partners
to share information about current
and nascent threats, adding value to
existing thought and expertise; and
•	 attribute specific cyber identities 

publicly when we judge it in the 

national interest to do so.


Measuring success
6.3.4. The Government will measure its
success in countering the actions of hostile
foreign actors by assessing progress
towards the following outcomes:
•	 the stronger information-sharing
networks that we have established with
our international partners, and wider
multilateral agreements in support of
lawful and responsible behaviour by
states, are substantially contributing to
our ability to understand and respond
to the threat, resulting in a better
defended UK; and
•	 our defence and deterrence measures,
alongside our country-specific
strategies, are making the UK a
harder target for hostile foreign
actors to act against.

6.4.

PREVENTING TERRORISM

6.4.1. The technical capability of terrorists
currently remains limited but they continue
to aspire to conduct damaging computer
network operations against the UK, with
publicity and disruption as the primary
objective of their cyber activity. The
Government will identify and disrupt
National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

terrorists using and intending to use cyber
for this purpose. In doing so, we will
minimise their impact and prevent an uplift
in terrorist cyber capability that would further
threaten UK networks and national security.

Objective
6.4.2. To mitigate the threat of terrorist
use of cyber, through the identification
and disruption of terrorist cyber actors
who currently hold, and aspire to build,
capability that could threaten UK
national security.

Our approach
6.4.3. To ensure the threat posed by cyber
terrorism remains low, we will:
•	 detect cyber terrorism threats,
identifying actors who are seeking to
conduct damaging network operations
against the UK and our allies;
•	 investigate and disrupt these cyber
terrorism actors to prevent them from
using cyber capability against the UK
and its allies; and
•	 work closely with international partners
to enable us to better tackle the threat
from cyber terrorism.

Measuring success
6.4.4. The Government will measure
its success in preventing terrorism by
assessing progress towards the
following outcomes:
•	 a full understanding of risk posed by
cyber terrorism, through identification
and investigation of cyber terrorism
threats to the UK; and
•	 close monitoring, and disruption of
terrorist cyber capability at the earliest
opportunity, with the aim of preventing
an increase in such terrorist capability
in the long term.

51

DETER

6.5.	 ENHANCING SOVEREIGN
CAPABILITIES – OFFENSIVE CYBER
6.5.1. Offensive cyber capabilities involve
deliberate intrusions into opponents’
systems or networks, with the intention
of causing damage, disruption or
destruction. Offensive cyber forms part
of the full spectrum of capabilities we
will develop to deter adversaries and to
deny them opportunities to attack us, in
both cyberspace and the physical sphere.
Through our National Offensive Cyber
Programme (NOCP), we have a dedicated
capability to act in cyberspace and we
will commit the resources to develop and
improve this capability.

Objective
6.5.2. We will ensure that we have at
our disposal appropriate offensive cyber
capabilities that can be deployed at a
time and place of our choosing, for both
deterrence and operational purposes, in
accordance with national and international
law.

Our approach
6.5.3.	 To do this, we will:
•	 invest in our NOCP – the partnership
between the Ministry of Defence and
GCHQ that is harnessing the skills and
talents of both organisations to deliver
the tools, techniques and tradecraft
required;
•	 develop our ability to use offensive 

cyber tools; and

•	 develop the ability of our Armed Forces
to deploy offensive cyber capabilities
as an integrated part of operations,
thereby enhancing the overall impact
we can achieve through military action.

Measuring success
6.5.4. The Government will measure our
success in establishing offensive cyber
capabilities by assessing progress towards
the following outcomes:
•	 the UK is a world leader in offensive
cyber capability; and
•	 the UK has established a pipeline

of skills and expertise to develop

and deploy our sovereign offensive 

cyber capabilities.


6.6.	 ENHANCING SOVEREIGN
CAPABILITIES – CRYPTOGRAPHY
6.6.1. Cryptographic capability is
fundamental to protecting our most
sensitive information and to choosing how
we deploy our Armed Forces and national
security capabilities. To maintain this
capability, we will require private sector
skills and technologies that are assured by
GCHQ. This is likely to require work to be
done in the UK, by British Nationals with
the requisite security clearance, working
for companies who are prepared to be
completely open with GCHQ in discussing
design and implementation details. The
MOD and GCHQ are working to establish
a sound understanding of the long-term
cost implications of maintaining such
sovereign cryptographic capabilities, based
on prevailing market conditions and in
cooperation with those companies currently
able to provide such solutions.

Objective
6.6.2. We have the confidence that the
UK will always have political control over
those cryptographic capabilities vital to our
national security and, therefore, the means
to protect UK secrets.

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

52
Section 6
DETER

Our approach

ENCRYPTION

6.6.3. We will select the means that allow
us to share information effectively with our
allies, and ensure that trusted information
and information systems are available,
when and where required. Working closely
with other government departments and
agencies, GCHQ and MOD will together
define sovereign requirements, and how
best to meet those requirements when
suppliers must be domestic. This will be
delivered through a new joint framework for
determining requirements for operational
advantage and freedom of action.

Encryption is the process of encoding
data or information to prevent
unauthorised access to it.

Measuring success
6.6.4. The Government will measure its
success in maintaining our cryptographic
capabilities by assessing progress towards
the following outcome:
•	 our sovereign cryptographic
capabilities are effective in keeping our
secrets and sensitive information safe
from unauthorised disclosure.

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

The Government is in favour of
encryption. It is a foundation stone
of a strong, internet-based economy:
it keeps people’s personal data and
intellectual property secure, and ensures
safe online commerce.
But as technology continues to evolve,
we have to ensure that there are no
guaranteed ‘safe spaces’ for terrorists
and criminals to operate beyond the
reach of the law.
The Government wants to work with
industry as technology develops
to ensure that, with a robust legal
framework and clear oversight, the
police and intelligence agencies
can access the content of the
communications of terrorists and
criminals. Existing legislation allows
for the communications of criminals
and terrorists to be intercepted when
a warrant is in place. Companies
have a duty to give effect to such
a warrant, providing the requested
communications, to the relevant
authority. When served with a warrant,
companies are asked to remove any
encryption that they themselves have
applied, or that has been applied
on their behalf, so that the material
provided is in readable form. The law
stipulates that companies are required
to take reasonable steps to give effect
to a warrant, and any assessment
of reasonableness will include an
assessment of the steps a company is
required to take to remove encryption.

55
Section 7
DEVELOP

7.0.1. The DEVELOP strand of the strategy
sets out how we will acquire and strengthen
the tools and capabilities that the UK needs
to protect itself from the cyber threat.
7.0.2. The UK requires more talented
and qualified cyber security professionals.
The Government will act now to plug
the growing gap between demand and
supply for key cyber security roles, and
inject renewed vigour into this area of
education and training. This is a long-term,
transformative objective, and this strategy
will kick-start this important work, which
will necessarily continue beyond 2021.
A skilled workforce is the lifeblood of a
vital and world leading cyber security
commercial ecosystem. This ecosystem
will ensure cyber start-ups prosper and
receive the investment and support they
need. This innovation and vigour can only
be provided by the private sector; but
the Government will act to support its
development, and actively promote the
wider cyber security sector to the world
market. A dynamic and thriving scientific
research sector is required to support both
the development of highly skilled people,
and to ensure that new ideas translate into
cutting-edge products.

7.1.	 STRENGTHENING CYBER SECURITY
SKILLS
7.1.1. The UK needs to tackle the systemic
issues at the heart of the cyber skills
shortage: the lack of young people entering
the profession; the shortage of current
cyber security specialists; insufficient
exposure to cyber and information security
concepts in computing courses; a shortage
of suitably qualified teachers; and the
absence of established career and training
pathways into the profession.
7.1.2. This calls for swift intervention by
the Government to help address the
current shortage and develop a coherent

long-term strategy that can build on
these interventions to close the skills
gap. However, it must be recognised
that to have any profound impact, this
effort must be collaborative, with input
from a range of participants and influencers
across the Devolved Administrations,
public sector, education providers,
academia bodies and industry.

Objective
7.1.3. The Government’s ambition is to
ensure the sustained supply of the best
possible home-grown cyber security talent,
whilst funding specific interventions in the
short term to help meet known skills gaps.
We will also define and develop the cyber
security skills needed across the population
and workforce to operate safely and
securely online.
7.1.4. This requires action over the next
twenty years, not just the next five. We will
define the long-term, coordinated set of
actions needed by government, industry,
education providers and academia to
establish a sustained supply of competent
cyber security professionals, who meet
the requisite standards and certification to
practise confidently and securely.
7.1.5. We will close the skills gap in
Defence. We will attract cyber specialists
to government who are not only effectively
trained but also ready to maintain our
national security. This includes an
understanding of the impact of cyberspace
on military operations.

Our approach
7.1.6. We will develop and implement a
self-standing skills strategy that builds on
existing work to integrate cyber security
into the education system. This will
continue to improve the state of computer
science teaching overall and embed cyber
National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

56
Section 7
DEVELOP

security into the curriculum. Everyone
studying computer science, technology
or digital skills will learn the fundamentals
of cyber security and will be able to bring
those skills into the workforce. As part
of this effort, we will address the gender
imbalance in cyber-focused professions,
and reach people from more diverse
backgrounds, to make sure we are
drawing from the widest available talent
pool. We will work closely with the
Devolved Administrations to encourage a
consistent approach across the UK.
7.1.7. We will set out more clearly the
respective roles of government and
industry, including how these might
evolve over time. The UK Government
and Devolved Administrations have a
key role in creating the right environment
for cyber security skills to be developed
and to update the education system to
reflect the changing needs of industry and
government. But employers also have a
significant responsibility to clearly articulate
their needs, as well as train and develop
employees and young people entering
the profession. Industry has an important
role in building diverse and attractive
career and training pathways in partnership
with academia, professional bodies and
trade associations.
7.1.8. In recognition of the collective
challenge we face in closing the skills
gap, we will establish a skills advisory
group formed of government, employers,
professional bodies, skills bodies,
education providers and academia, which
will strengthen the coherence between
these key sectors. This group will support
the development of a long-term strategy
which will take account of developments in
the broad field of digital skills, ensuring that
cyber security considerations are aligned
and incorporated throughout. This group
will work with similar bodies across the UK.

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

7.1.9. Alongside this work, the Government
will invest in a range of initiatives to bring
about immediate improvements and inform
the development of the long-term skills
strategy. These include:
•	 establishing a schools programme
to create a step change in specialist
cyber security education and
training for talented 14-18 year olds
(involving classroom-based activities,
after-school sessions with expert
mentors, challenging projects and
summer schools);
•	 creating higher and degree-level
apprenticeships within the energy,
finance and transport sectors to
address skills gaps in essential areas;
•	 establishing a fund to retrain
candidates already in the workforce
who show a high potential for the cyber
security profession;
•	 identifying and supporting quality cyber
graduate and post graduate education,
and identifying and filling any specialist
skills gaps – acknowledging the key
role that universities play in skills
development;
•	 supporting the accreditation of teacher
professional development in cyber
security. This work will help teachers,
and others supporting learning, to
understand cyber security education
and provide a method of externally
accrediting such individuals;
•	 developing the cyber security
profession, including through achieving
Royal Chartered status by 2020,
reinforcing the recognised body of cyber
security excellence within the industry
and providing a focal point which can
advise, shape and inform national policy;
•	 developing a Defence Cyber Academy
as a centre of excellence for cyber
training and exercise across the
Ministry of Defence and wider
Government, addressing specialist
skills and wider education;

57
Section 7
DEVELOP

•	 developing opportunities for
collaboration in training and education
between government, the Armed
Forces, industry and academia,
together with facilities to maintain and
exercise skills; and
•	 we will work with industry to expand the
CyberFirst programme to identify and
nurture the diverse young talent pool to
defend our national security; and
•	 embedding cyber security and digital
skills as an integral an integral part of
relevant courses within the education
system, from primary to postgraduate
levels, setting standards, improving
quality and providing a firm foundation
for onwards progression into the field.
As education is a devolved matter,
some of these initiatives will apply mainly
in England. We will however work with the
Devolved Administrations to encourage
a consistent approach across the UK
education systems.

Measuring success
7.1.10. The Government will measure our
success in strengthening cyber security
skills by assessing progress towards the
following outcomes:
•	 there are effective and clear entry
routes into the cyber-security
profession, which are attractive to a
diverse range of people;
•	 by 2021 cyber security is taught 

effectively as an integral part of 

relevant courses from primary to

post-graduate level;

•	 cyber security is widely acknowledged
as an established profession with clear
career pathways, and has achieved
Royal Chartered Status;
•	 appropriate cyber security knowledge
is an integral part of the continual
professional development for relevant
non-cyber security professionals,

across the economy; and
•	 the Government and the Armed Forces
and the Armed Forces have access to
cyber specialists able to maintain the
security and resilience of the UK.

7.2.	 STIMULATING GROWTH IN THE
CYBER SECURITY SECTOR
7.2.1. A burgeoning and innovative cyber
security sector is a necessity for our modern,
digital economy. UK cyber security firms
provide world-leading technologies, training
and advice to industry and governments.
But whilst the UK is a leading player, it faces
fierce competition to stay ahead. There are
also barriers that the Government needs
to address. UK companies and academics
develop cutting-edge technology, but some
require support to develop the commercial
and entrepreneurial skills required to thrive.
There are funding gaps that prevent SMEs
from growing and expanding into new
markets and territories. The most ground­
breaking products and services,
that offer the potential to keep us ahead
of the threat, struggle to find customers
who are willing to act as early adopters.
Overcoming these challenges requires
government, industry and academia to
work effectively together.

Objective
7.2.2. The Government will support the
creation of a growing, innovative and
thriving cyber security sector in the UK in
order to create an ecosystem where:
•	 security companies prosper, and get
the investment they need to grow;
•	 the best minds from government,
academia and the private sector
collaborate closely to spur innovation; and
•	 customers of the Government and
industry are sufficiently confident
and prepared to adopt cutting-edge
services.
National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

58
Section 7
DEVELOP

Our approach
7.2.3. To create this ecosystem, we will:
•	 commercialise innovation in academia,
providing training and mentoring to
academics;
•	 establish two innovation centres, to
drive the development of cutting-edge
cyber products and dynamic new cyber
security companies, which will sit at
the heart of a programme of initiatives
to give start-ups the support they need
to get their first customers and attract
further investment;
•	 allocate a proportion of the £165m
Defence and Cyber Innovation Fund
to support innovative procurement in
defence and security;
•	 provide testing facilities for companies
to develop their products, together with
a fast-track form of assessment for
the next generation of cyber security
products and services as they emerge,
enabling customers to be confident in
their use;
•	 draw on the collective expertise of

the industry-government Cyber

Growth Partnership to help shape

and focus further growth and 

innovation interventions;

•	 help companies of all sizes scale-up
and access international markets; and
•	 promote agreed international standards
that support access to the UK market.

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

7.2.4. We will also use the weight
of government procurement to spur
innovation. The Government faces some of
the hardest challenges in cyber security,
and some of the biggest threats. We
can, and must, pursue the most effective
solutions to these problems. That means
making it easier for smaller companies
to do business with government. It also
means the Government must be less risk
averse in testing and using new products.
This is a win-win solution: the Government
will get the best services, and innovative
technology will get an early adopter,
making it easier to attract investment
and a larger customer base. We will
encourage all parts of government,
including the Devolved Administrations,
to take a similar approach.

“We want to create a cyber ecosystem
in which cyber start-ups proliferate, get
the investment and support they need
to win business around the world, to
provide a pipeline of innovation that
channels ideas between the private
sector, government and academia.”
The Rt Hon Matt Hancock MP,
Minister of State for Digital and Culture

59
Section 7
DEVELOP

Measuring success
7.2.5. The Government will measure its
success in stimulating growth in the cyber
security sector by assessing progress
towards the following outcomes:
•	 greater than average global growth
in the size of the UK cyber sector year
on year;
•	 a significant increase in investment in
early stage companies;
•	 adoption of more innovative and
effective cyber security technologies in
government.

7.3.	 PROMOTING CYBER SECURITY
SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY
7.3.1. The UK’s thriving science and
technology sector and its cutting-edge
research, underpins our world-leading
cyber security capabilities. To maintain
and enhance the UK’s reputation as a
global leader in cutting-edge research,
we need our academic research
establishments to continue to attract the
best and the brightest minds in the field
of cyber security. This will require us to
foster centres of excellence that attract
the most able and dynamic scientists
and researchers, and deepen the active
partnership between academia, the
Government and industry. This will involve
a match-making role for the Government,
where we incentivise such collaborations.
Success would see us establish a selfsustaining ecosystem that allows ideas –
and people – to circulate between the
three sectors in a mutually beneficial way.

Objective
7.3.2. By 2021, the UK will have
strengthened its position as a world
leader in cyber science and technology.
Flexible partnerships between universities
and industry will translate research into

commercially successful products and
services. The UK will maintain its reputation
for innovative excellence, including in those
areas of exceptional national strength, such
as the financial sector.

Our approach
7.3.3. To achieve this, the Government will
encourage collaboration, innovative and
flexible funding models for research, and the
commercialisation of research. Government
will ensure that the human and behavioural
aspects of cyber are given sufficient
attention, and that systems beyond the
technical, such as business processes
and organisational structures, are included
within cyber science and technology.
7.3.4. This will underpin the creation
of products, systems and services that
are ‘secure by default’, with appropriate
security considered from the outset and
where security becomes a conscious
‘opt-out’ for users.
7.3.5. We will publish a detailed Cyber
Science and Technology Strategy after a
thorough consultation with partners and
stakeholders. This will include identifying
areas of science and technology that
the Government, industry and academia
consider to be important and identifying
gaps in the UK’s current capacity to
address them.
7.3.6. The Government will continue
to provide funding and support for the
Academic Centres of Excellence, Research
Institutes and Centres for Doctoral Training.
In addition, we will create a new Research
Institute in a strategically important subject
area. We will also fund further research in
those areas where the upcoming Cyber
Science and Technology Strategy identifies
capability gaps. Important areas that will
be given consideration include: big data
analytics; autonomous systems; trustworthy
National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

60
Section 7
DEVELOP

industrial control systems; cyber-physical
systems and the Internet of Things; smart
cities; automated system verification; and
the science of cyber security.
7.3.7. We will continue to sponsor UK
national PhD students at the Academic
Centres of Excellence to increase the
number of UK nationals with cyber
expertise.
7.3.8. The Government will work with
bodies, including Innovate UK and
the Research Councils to encourage
collaboration between industry, the
Government and academia. To support this
collaboration we will review best practice
concerning security classifications and
identify security-cleared experts, including
academics. This will ensure that work from
the unclassified space to beyond secret
can be as collaborative as possible.
7.3.9. The Government will fund a ‘grand
challenge’ to identify and provide innovative
solutions to some of the most pressing
problems in cyber security. CyberInvest, a
new industry and Government partnership
to support cutting-edge cyber security
research and protect the UK in cyberspace,
will be part of our approach to building
the academic-government-industry
partnership.

Measuring success
7.3.10. The Government will measure
its success in promoting cyber security
science and technology by assessing
progress towards the following outcomes:
•	 significantly increased numbers 

of UK companies successfully 

commercialising academic cyber 

research and fewer agreed and 

identified gaps in the UK’s cyber 

security research capability with 

effective action to close them; and

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

•	 the UK is regarded as a global leader in
cyber security research and innovation.

7.4.

EFFECTIVE HORIZON SCANNING

7.4.1. The Government must ensure
that policy-making takes account of the
changing cyber, geopolitical and technology
landscape. To do this, we need to make
effective use of broad horizon scanning
and assessment work. We need to invest in
proofing ourselves against future threats and
anticipate market changes that might affect
our cyber resilience in five to ten years’ time.
We need horizon scanning programmes
that generate recommendations to inform
current and future government policy and
programme planning.

Objective
7.4.2. The Government will ensure that our
horizon scanning programmes include a
rigorous assessment of cyber risk, and that
this is integrated into cyber security and
other technology policy development areas,
along with all-source assessment and other
available evidence. We will join up horizon
scanning between national security and other
policy areas to ensure a holistic assessment
of emerging challenges and opportunities.

Our approach
7.4.3. We will:
•	 identify gaps in current work, and
coordinate work across disciplinary
boundaries to develop a holistic approach
to horizon scanning for cyber security;
•	 promote better integration of technical
aspects of cyber security with
behavioural science;
•	 support rigorous monitoring of the
cyber criminal market place to spot
new tools and services that might
enable technology transfer to hostile
states, terrorists or criminals;

61
Section 7
DEVELOP

•	 analyse emergent internet-connected
process control technologies;
•	 anticipate vulnerabilities around digital
currencies; and
•	 monitor market trends in 

telecommunications technologies 

to develop early defences against 

anticipated future attacks. 

7.4.4. We recognise that horizon scanning
goes beyond the technical, to include
political, economic, legislative, social
and environmental dimensions. Cyber
security is just one aspect of the issues
that effective horizon scanning can help
to address. Therefore, we will ensure that
where we conduct horizon scanning of
these other policy areas, we will take into
account any cyber security implications.
7.4.5. We will also ensure that cyber
policy-making follows an evidence-based
approach, taking into account assessments
from all available sources. This will include,
for example:
•	 specific technical evidence, for example
on the Internet of Things, or the future
role of advanced materials; and

•	 international strategic and societal 

trends and their impact on cyber.

7.4.6. We will ensure that cyber security is
considered within the remit of the crossGovernment Emerging Technology and
Innovation Analysis Cell (ETIAC), which
will be established to identify technology
threats and opportunities relevant to
national security and that cyber is
considered by existing horizon-scanning
structures, including the Government
Futures Group (GFG), and the Cabinet
Secretary’s Advisory Group on horizon
scanning (CSAG).

Measuring success
7.4.7. The Government will measure our
success in establishing an effective horizon
scanning capability by assessing progress
towards the following outcomes:
•	 cross-government horizon scanning
and all-source assessment are
integrated into cyber policy making; and
•	 the impact of cyber security is

factored into all cross-government 

horizon scanning.

INTERNATIONAL ACTION

8.1.
Our economic prosperity and
social wellbeing increasingly depend on
the openness and security of networks
that extend beyond our own borders.
It is essential that we work closely with
international partners to ensure the
continuation of a free, open, peaceful and
secure cyberspace that delivers these
benefits. This will only become more
important as the next billion users come
online across the globe.
8.2.
International cooperation on
cyber issues has become an essential
part of wider global economic and
security debates. It is a rapidly evolving
area of policy, without a single agreed
international vision. The UK and its allies
have been successful in ensuring some
elements of the rules-based international
system are in place: there has been
agreement that international law applies
in cyberspace; that human rights apply
online as they do offline; and a broad
consensus that the multi-stakeholder
approach is the best way to manage the
complexities of governing the Internet.
However, with a growing divide over how
to address the common challenge of
reconciling national security with individual
rights and freedoms, any global consensus
remains fragile.

“We must work internationally to agree
the rules of the road that will ensure
the UK’s future security and prosperity
in cyberspace.”

growth and underpinning the UK’s national
security. On this basis, the UK will continue
to: champion the multi-stakeholder
model of internet governance; oppose
data localisation; and work to build the
capacity of our partners to improve their
own cyber security. In order to reduce the
threat to the UK and our interests, much
of which originates overseas, we will seek
to influence the decision-making of those
engaging in cyber crime, cyber espionage,
and disruptive or destructive cyber activity
and continue to build frameworks to
support international cooperation.

Our Approach
8.4.

To do this we will:

•	 strengthen and embed a common 

understanding of responsible state 

behaviour in cyberspace;

•	 build on agreement that international
law applies in cyberspace;
•	 continue to promote the agreement
of voluntary, non-binding, norms of
responsible state behaviour;
•	 support the development and
implementation of confidence-building
measures;
•	 increase our ability to disrupt and
prosecute cyber criminals based
abroad, especially in hard-to-reach
jurisdictions;
•	 help foster an environment which
allows our law enforcement agencies
to work together to ensure fewer
places exist where cyber criminals
can act without fear of investigation
and prosecution;
•	 promote the resilience of cyberspace
by shaping the technical standards
governing emerging technologies
National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

Section 8
INTERNATIONAL ACTION

internationally (including encryption),
making cyberspace more ‘secure by
design’ and promoting best practice;
•	 work to build common approaches
amongst like-minded countries for
capabilities such as strong encryption,
which have cross-border implications;
•	 build the capacity of others to tackle
threats to the UK, and our interests
overseas;
•	 continue to help our partners develop
their own cyber security – since
we share a single cyberspace, we
collectively become stronger when
each country improves its own
defences;
•	 ensure that NATO is prepared for the
conflicts of the 21st century, which will
play out in cyberspace as well as on
the battlefield;
•	 work with our allies to enable NATO to
operate as effectively in cyberspace as
it does on land, air and sea; and
•	 ensure that the ‘London Process’ of
Global Conferences on Cyberspace
continues to promote global consensus
towards a free, open, peaceful and
secure cyberspace.
8.5.
There are a range of relationships
and tools we will continue to invest in to
deliver and underpin all our international
cyber objectives; we cannot achieve our
objectives in isolation. These include:
•	 working in concert with traditional
allies and new partners to establish
and maintain strong active political
and operational relationships; creating
the political conditions to build strong
global alliances;
•	 using our influence with multilateral
organisations such as the United
Nations, G20, European Union,
NATO, OSCE, Council of Europe, the
Commonwealth and within the global
development community; and

National Cyber Security Strategy 2016

•	 building stronger relationships with
non-government actors – industry,
civil society, academia and the
technical community. These actors
are crucial in informing and challenging
international policy formulation, and
strengthening political messages on
a wide range of cyber issues. Our
world-class academic links provide
a neutral, collaborative platform with
international partners.

Measuring Success
8.6
The Government will measure its
success in advancing our international
interests in cyber by assessing progress
towards the following outcomes:
•	 enhanced international collaboration
reduces cyber threat to the UK and
our interest overseas;
•	 a common understanding of 

responsible state behaviour in 

cyberspace;

•	 international partners have increased
their cyber security capability; and
•	 strengthened international consensus
on the benefits of a free, open,
peaceful and secure cyberspace.

METRICS

9.1.
Cyber security remains an area of
relative immaturity when it comes to the
measurement of outcomes and impacts
– normally referred to as metrics. Already
the science of cyber security has been
obscured by hyperbole and obstructed
by an absence of calibrated data. This is
a source of frustration for policy-makers
and businesses alike, who have struggled
to measure investment against outcomes.
The Government assesses that the effective
use of metrics is essential for delivering this
strategy and focussing the resources that
underpin it.
9.2.
We will ensure that this strategy
is founded upon a rigorous and
comprehensive set of metrics against
which we measure progress towards the
outcomes we need to achieve. As well
as being a major deliverable under the
Strategy in its own right, the NCSC will
play a crucial role in enabling other parts of
Government, industry and society to deliver
all of these strategic outcomes within this
strategy.
9.3.
Annex 3 sets out how the success
measures set out in the strategy will
contribute to the strategic outcomes,
which will be reviewed annually to ensure
they accurately reflect our national goals
and requirements. The headline, strategic
outcomes are as follows:

1.	 The UK has the capability effectively
to detect investigate and counter the
threat from the cyber activities of our
adversaries.
2.	 The impact of cybercrime on the
UK and its interests is significantly
reduced and cyber criminals are
deterred from targeting the UK.
3.	 The UK has the capability to manage
and respond effectively to cyber
incidents to reduce the harm they
cause to the UK and counter cyber
adversaries.
4.	 Our partnerships with industry on
active cyber defence mean that large
scale phishing and malware attacks
are no longer effective.
5.	 The UK is more secure as a result of
technology products and services
having cyber security designed into
them and activated by default.
6.	 Government networks and services
will be as secure as possible from the
moment of their first implementation.
The public will be able to use
government digital services with
confidence and trust that their
information is safe.
7.	 All organisations in the UK, large
and small, are effectively managing
their cyber risk and are supported by
high quality advice designed by the
NCSC, underpinned by the right mix
of regulation and incentives.
8.	 There is the right ecosystem in the
UK to develop and sustain a cyber
security sector that can meet our
national security demands.

9.	 The UK has a sustainable supply
of home grown cyber skilled
professionals to meet the growing
demands of an increasingly digital
economy, in both the public and
private sectors, and defence.
10. The UK is universally acknowledged
as a global leader in cyber security
research and development,
underpinned by high levels of expertise
in UK industry and academia.

longer term outcomes are allocated beyond
2021 to industry, regulators, auditors,
insurers and other parts of the public and
private sector, as the effective management
of cyber security risks is integrated into
standard management activity for all.

9.4.
We recognise that some of our
ambitions for this strategy go beyond
its five year timescale. In order that any
future investment in cyber beyond 2021
can continue to deliver the maximum
transformative effect, we intend that these

CONCLUSION
CYBER SECURITY BEYOND 2021

10.1. The rapid evolution of the cyber
landscape will constantly throw up new
challenges as technology evolves and our
adversaries act to exploit it. However, this
strategy aims to provide a range of policies,
tools and capabilities that will ensure we
can respond quickly and flexibly to each
new challenge as it arises.

10.4. Even in the most optimistic scenario,
some of the challenges the UK faces in
the cyber domain, whether in scale or
complexity, may need more than five years
to address. This strategy nonetheless
provides us with the means to transform
our future security and safeguard our
prosperity in the digital era.

10.2. Should we fail to act effectively,
the threat will continue to outpace our
ability to protect ourselves against it.
We can expect an explosion of threat
capability at all levels.
10.3. Conversely, if we realise these
ambitions, all parts of UK government,
business and society will play their part
in delivering the country’s overall cyber
security. If we can ensure security is
designed and built in, by default, into
commodity technologies, consumers
and businesses would have less cause
to worry about cyber security. Should
the UK consolidate its reputation as a
secure environment to do business online,
more global companies and investors
will choose to locate here. Security for
CNI networks and priority sectors would
be more effective. Potential attackers
looking to develop tools and attack
methods against systems holding key
functions and data would in turn have
to work harder to overcome the layered
security that surrounds them. This would
change the risk versus reward equation
for cyber criminals and malicious actors,
who would expect to face the same threat
of prosecution internationally as they do
for traditional crimes. If we can succeed
in mainstreaming cyber security across
all parts of our society, it could mean that
Government itself can step back from
such a prominent role, allowing the
market and the technology to drive the
evolution of cyber security across the
economy and society.

Indicative success measures (to 2021)

Contributes to

1. The UK has the
capability to
effectively detect,
investigate and
counter the threat
from the cyber
activities of our
adversaries.

• The stronger information sharing networks that we
have established with our international partners, and
wider multilateral agreements in support of lawful and
responsible behaviour by states, are substantially
contributing to our ability to understand and respond to the
threat, resulting in a better defended UK.
• Our defence and deterrence measures, alongside our
country-specific strategies, are making the UK a harder
target for hostile foreign actors and cyber terrorists to
succeed against.
• Improved understanding of the cyber threat from hostile
foreign and terrorist actors, through identification and
investigation of cyber terrorism threats to the UK.
• Ensuring that terrorist cyber capability remains low in the
long term, through close monitoring of capability, and
disruption of terrorist cyber potential and activity at the
earliest opportunity.
• The UK is a world leader in offensive cyber capability.
• The UK has established a pipeline of skills and expertise to
develop and deploy our sovereign offensive cyber capabilities.
• Our sovereign cryptographic capabilities are effective in
keeping our secrets and sensitive information safe from
unauthorised disclosure.

2.	 The impact of
cybercrime on the
UK and its interests
is significantly
reduced and
cyber criminals
are deterred from
targeting the UK.

• We are having a greater disruptive effect on cyber criminals
attacking the UK, with increased numbers of arrests and
convictions, and larger numbers of criminal networks
dismantled as a result of law enforcement intervention.
• Improved law enforcement capability, including: capacity
and skills for both dedicated specialists and mainstream
officers; and enhanced overseas law enforcement capability.
• Improved effectiveness, and increased scale, of early
intervention (“PREVENT”) measures is dissuading and
reforming offenders.
• A reduction in low-level cyber offences as a result of cyber
criminal services being harder to access and less effective.

DETER


3.	 The UK has
the capability
to manage and
respond effectively
to cyber incidents
to reduce the harm
they cause to the
UK and counter
cyber adversaries.

• A higher proportion of incidents are reported to the
authorities, leading to a better understanding of the size
and scale of the threat.
• Cyber incidents are managed more effectively, efficiently
and comprehensively, as a result of the creation of the
National Cyber Security Centre as a centralised incident
reporting and response mechanism.
• We will address the root causes of attacks at a national
level, reducing the occurrence of repeated exploitation
across multiple victims and sectors.

Contributes to

4.	 Our partnerships
with industry
on active cyber
defence mean
that large scale
phishing and
malware attacks
are no longer
effective.

• The UK is harder to “phish”, because we have large-scale
defences against the use of malicious domains, more
active anti-phishing protection at scale and it is much
harder to use other forms of communication, such as
‘vishing’ and SMS spoofing, to conduct social engineering
attacks.
• A far larger proportion of malware communications and
technical artefacts associated with cyber attacks and
exploitation are being blocked.
• The UK’s internet and telecommunications traffic is
significantly less vulnerable to rerouting by malicious
actors.
• GCHQ, Defence and NCA capabilities to respond to
serious state-sponsored and criminal threats have
significantly increased.

DEFEND

5.	 The UK is more
secure as a result
of technology
products and
services having
cyber security
designed into them
and activated by
default.

• The majority of commodity products and services available
in the UK in 2021 are making the UK more secure, because
they have their default security settings enabled by default
or have security integrated into their design.
• Government services are trusted by the UK public,
because they have been implemented as securely
as possible, and fraud levels against them are within
acceptable risk parameters.

DEFEND

6.	 Government
networks and
services will be as
secure as possible
from the moment
of their first
implementation.
The public will
be able to use
government digital
services with
confidence, and
trust that their
information is safe.

• Government has an in-depth understanding of the level of
cyber security risk across the whole of government and the
wider public sector.
• Individual government departments and other bodies
protect themselves in proportion to their level of risk and to
an agreed government minimum standard.
• Government departments and the wider public sector are
resilient and can respond effectively to cyber incidents,
maintaining functions and recovering quickly.
• New technologies and digital services deployed by
government will be cyber secure by default.
• We are aware of, and actively mitigating, all known
internet-facing vulnerabilities in government systems
and services;
• All government suppliers meet appropriate cyber security
standards.
