THE FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA
NATIONAL ICT AND TELECOMMUNICATIONS
TELECOMMUNICATIONS
POLICY

September 2012

MESSAGE FROM THE PRESIDENT OF THE FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA

Ran Annim, Kaselehlie, Mogethin and Len Mwo!

I am pleased to present the first National Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and
Telecommunications Policy for the Federated States of Micronesia. The policy is an overarching
framework which comprehensively addresses Information and Communication Technology and
Telecommunication policies within the Federated States of Micronesia and establishes the direction for a
secure and flourishing ICT environment for all citizens in FSM. To this extent, I am personally committed
to the implementation of this policy which builds on the many consultations with the FSM leaders,
stakeholders, and international and regional organizations.
The National ICT Policy has been a work in progress and I would like to express my appreciation to the
International Telecommunications Union (ITU), the stakeholders who participated in the consultations on
the development of the plan, the Chief Executives Council (CEC), the State and National Leadership
Council (SNLC), the World Bank, and many individuals and organizations who have contributed to the
development of the National ICT Policy.
I fully endorse this National ICT and Telecommunications Policy and Strategic Action Plan and ask you all
to work with us as we implement this policy for the people of the FSM. I further direct that this Action
Plan be incorporated into the FSM Strategic Economic Development Plan.
We are all well aware that ICT and telecommunications are recognized worldwide as a critical factor in
driving the progress of economic and social development in today’s modern society. While we are very
proud of our common Micronesian heritage, and will continue to preserve the age-old wisdoms that have
been passed down from our forefathers, we, the people of this nation must not be isolated from the global
community. We cannot afford to be left behind, if not for us, then for our children and their children.
Telecommunications and ICT are the means which connects us within our communities, between our
many islands, and to the global community. We cannot deny the fact that it is evident in other countries
that changes in ICT and telecommunications policy have changed the way we communicate with each
other, conduct government, handle business and commerce, educate our children, provide health
services, and preserve our rich heritage and environment.
We are also cognizant of the many studies and recommendations by consultants to regional and
international economic development organizations such as the Asian Development Bank and the World
Bank that liberalization and reform of telecommunications in the FSM will positively contribute to
economic development. Thus, in 2007, I established the Telecommunications and Submarine Fiber Optics
Task Force and directed the Task Force in 2011 to modernize the policy, legal, and regulatory
infrastructure for telecommunications and work with international funding organizations to move
forward with broadband capacity for all states.

~ ii ~

At the same time we are seeking to develop the ICT and telecommunications sector to support the social
and economic objectives of the FSM, we should be mindful of the potential negative impacts associated
with the new technologies. It is in this context that the FSM requires a good and sound policy to ensure
our people, especially our children, are provided a safe ICT environment and develop the policy and
infrastructure to extend services to islands and locations not currently served.
The overall vision of the National ICT Policy is to have a “Secure, Efficient, and Affordable ICT to achieve
equitable communication for the People of the FSM.” This vision establishes the fundamental guiding
core principle of the policy.
As President, I envision many islands, one nation through a safe, reliable, and affordable ICT for every
citizen in the FSM. Government aims to empower citizens, enhanced democratic values and promote
social and economic sustainable development. The expansion, diversification and effective application of
ICT will help to establish a transparent, responsive and accountable government; develop skilled human
resources; enhance social equity; ensure cost-effective delivery of services through public-private
partnerships and provide enhanced opportunities for education, health and emergency management
services; and enable a knowledge based society to secure a brighter future for all. Towards this end, I
have tasked the Department of Transportation Communication and Infrastructure to lead this challenging
and important initiative and implement the Strategic Action Plan. I direct our collective effort as
stakeholders to ensure that we achieve our Vision.
With the endorsement of this National ICT Policy, the Federated States of Micronesia is charting the way
forward for ICT and telecommunications development, addressing barriers, and highlighting priority
areas in how ICT can contribute to improving the standard of living of all the people in the Federated
States of Micronesia.
I therefore urge all offices in the National Government to commit to achieving the strategic goals and
objectives to meet our Vision. I also invite the State Governments, FSM Telecom Corporation, private
sectors including non-government organizations and Academia to contribute in implementing this policy.
The Vision and the Action Plan can only be fully realized through our joint and collective efforts. We must
collaborate in a way that helps bridge the digital divide for FSM.
Thank you,

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
CKNOWLEDGEMENT FROM SECRETARY OF THE DEPARTMENT OF
TRANSPORTATION, COMMUNICATION AND INFRASTRUCTURE

As the Secretary of the Department of Transportation Communication and Infrastructure, I would like to
express my sincere gratitude and appreciation for all the individuals and organizations that have
participated in the development and formulation of the Federated
Federated States of Micronesia National ICT
Policy and Strategic Action Plan. I am also pleased to say, that the development of this policy was truly a
joint and collective effort that involved stakeholders representing the various public and private sectors
sectors.
We acknowledge the significant contributions from the National and State Government offices/agencies
that have taken an active role in developing this policy through the public consultations and subsequent
finalization of this policy and action plan. His
His Excellency President Manny Mori has explicitly directed all
departments and offices to give high priority and commitment to achieving the vision, goals, and
objectives as stated in the policy.
The National ICT Policy is structured on the regional best practices
practices in the Pacific and will continue to
evolve as new challenges will arise with the development of new technologies to better suit the demands
of our continuing nation building efforts. It is thus befitting to mention here, that the development of tthis
policy started several years ago with the continued support and assistance of many regional partners. We
appreciate the steadfast support and significant contribution of the International Telecommunication
Union (ITU) through the ITU-European
European Commission
Commission (EC) project for the Pacific Island countries
(ICB4PAC) that has provided Pacific Island regional ICT capacity development and contributed to the
framework of this National ICT Policy. We appreciate the insightful comments of the World Bank which
helped
d to highlight specific development benchmarks. We also acknowledge the assistance of the
Sasakawa Peace Foundation, the Pan-Pacific
Pan Pacific Education and Communication Experiments by Satellite
(PEACESAT) program of the University of Hawaii, the Secretariat of the
the Pacific Community (SPC), and
other regional and international development partners that have assisted FSM with ICT capacity building
over the many years.
Developing this plan is only the first step of the process, the tip of the iceberg, metaphorically sspeaking.
Realizing the plan is the real challenge that will truly test our collective commitment to initiating the
changes required to achieve the vision in the National ICT and Telecommunications Policy. It will require
all of us to work together. It will
ill not only require a national effort across all sectors of our society, but
also better management of our limited funding and human resources. I am truly confident that this
generation of Micronesians, together, through team work and determination will rise to the challenge. As
it is said in the Pacific, let our guiding principles lead us to “think big, start small and scale up fast.”
Sincerely,

Francis I. Itimai
Secretary

THE FEDERATED STATES OF MICRONESIA NATIONAL ICT AND
TELECOMMUNICATIONS POLICY
Executive Summary
This National Information and Communication Technology (ICT) Policy establishes an overarching
framework to harmonize national priorities through a participatory and inclusive approach. The
objective of this document is to integrate national ICT policy and direction with the individual sector
goals of the Federated States of Micronesia. The ICT policy shall be aligned with the National
Strategic Development Plan that defines social and economic goals of the Federated States of
Micronesia.
The National ICT Policy set out in this document serves to: (i) provide a clear National ICT policy and
telecommunications statement; (ii) guide ICT and telecommunications development; (iii) specify the
key challenges and untapped opportunities; and, (iv)identify the strategic priorities by building on
successful approaches and initiatives and mobilizing relevant resources and partnerships.

A.

Vision

“Secure, Efficient and Affordable ICT to achieve equitable communication for the People of
FSM”
With this vision we aim to empower citizens, enhance democratic values and promote social and
sustainable economic development. The expansion, diversification and effective application of ICT
will establish a transparent, responsive and accountable government; develop skilled human
resources; enhance social equity; ensure cost-effective delivery of services through public-private
partnerships and provide enhanced opportunities for education, health and emergency management
services; and enable a knowledge based society to secure a brighter future for all.

B.

Goals

To enact on our vision, five Goals were identified in the consultations and establish the foundation of
the FSM National ICT Policy:
(i)

Achieve Accessible and Affordable Communications for All,

(ii)

Strengthen ICT Human Resources and Increase Human Resource Development
Opportunities through ICT,

(iii)

Improve Economic Growth and Sustainable Development through ICT,

(iv)

Utilize ICT for Good Governance and

(v)

Create an Enabling ICT Environment through Policy Reform and Improvements in Legal
Frameworks.

~2~

Goal 1: Achieve Accessible, Secure and Affordable Broadband Communications for
All
Policy Statement: All citizens will have equitable access to affordable and secure ICT.
The Government will play a leading role in building a networked society where organizations and
individuals have equitable access to ICT-enabled resources.
It is a fundamental right for all citizens to have equal access to affordable ICT without discrimination
of income, level of literacy, urban or rural and people with special needs. ICT infrastructure in rural
and remote communities in FSM is underdeveloped. Consequently these communities have no or
limited access to internet and advanced communication services. Furthermore, due to the
developing economy and high cost of ICT and telecommunication services most homes cannot afford
a computer and the recurring cost of services. As a result FSM citizens in general do not have easy
access to important public information available on the internet, cannot access essential health and
educational material, and are not easily able to participate in online learning opportunities.
The Government will increase accessibility by maximizing existing resources and sharing ICT access
points in public locations such as local government institutions, post offices, health centers, and
schools and thus increasing citizens’ awareness of and ability to access ICT and e-Government
services as these services become available.

Goal 2: Strengthen ICT Human Resources and Increase Human Resource
Development Opportunities through the Use of ICT
Policy Statement: To implement and sustain the national ICT vision, the Government is committed
to prioritizing ICT workforce development and strengthening the overall workforce knowledge skills
and abilities by increasing human resource development opportunities through the use of ICT.
There is a need to develop a critical mass of human resources with ICT skills to implement and sustain
the National ICT vision. ICT human resource development is needed at all levels including leaders,
policy makers, consumers of ICT and the ICT workforce. The implementation of ICT in education and
training provides an opportunity for reducing cost and expanding program outreach to more people
in the Federated States of Micronesia. Government will utilize the most cost effective technologies
and digital contents to produce ICT knowledge, skills, and abilities to garner confidence in our people
in order to participate in the globalized economy. To this means, ICT will be leveraged for education
or e-Learning to address the most challenging and resource constrained subjects, including
mathematics, science, and languages. Government will support e-Learning programs for vocational
and ‘lifelong education’ opportunities for youth and adults to develop updated and relevant skills
needed to be competitive in the current workforce. At the same time it is recognized that e-Learning
programs make available for more professional development and training opportunities for private
and public sector employees thus reducing the high cost of travel for overseas training programs.
Government encourages the coordination and participation in local and regional e-Learning programs
to strengthen and enhance overall human resource development through the use of ICT.

~3~

Goal 3: Improve Economic Growth and Sustainable Development through ICT
Policy Statement: ICT will be utilized by the Government and the private sector to maximize
economic growth and sustainable development.
Government will harness the potential of ICT to increase productivity of businesses, especially small
and medium enterprises, and induce economic growth through widespread distribution and effective
use of ICT. It is recognized that there is potential to transform the way government, business and
consumers communicate and interact through ICT. Thus Government will promote the use of ICT by
the private and public sectors as a tool to maximize economic growth through the development of
websites and e-Commerce to enable the buying and selling of local and overseas products online.
Economic development shall be achieved through the utilization of ICT to collect and distribute
valuable data to businesses regarding market price, supply chain and consumer information.
Government will promote ICT development and investment in FSM.
An ICT-based market will enable access to mechanisms that will not only benefit disadvantaged
producers and businesses by ensuring equitable access to domestic and international markets but
also to allow for transparent and efficient monitoring of market activities by government. The
productivity and global competitiveness of the private sector including small businesses will increase
by lowering costs of doing businesses through Government-to-Business services (G2B).
The Federated States of Micronesia must diversify, expand, and bolster the national ICT industry,
including the telecommunication industry, in order to provide more technical solutions, services, and
options for all consumers in the Federated States of Micronesia. At the same time, the industry,
especially the IT-enabled services sub-sectors, can be promoted as a substantial national driver for
growth through export earnings and employment of youth.
Government will also support and utilize ICT to promote sustainable development in health,
education and other public service applications such as public safety, language and cultural
perpetuation and protection of our environment.

Goal 4: Utilize ICT for Good Governance
Policy Statement: Every effort will be made to ensure that ICT systems and processes are used to
enhance government accountability, efficiency, effectiveness, and transparency of delivering public
services to all and combat corruption.
Access to information is vital for transparency, accountability, and rule of law as it enables
community based participatory involvement in political decision-making. Increased access to ICT will
enable grassroots and community based participation by instituting interactive communication
channels facilitated by ICT.
Government will utilize ICT to support and improve the process whereby public institutions conduct
public affairs, manage public resources, and guarantee the realization of rights and services without
abuse, corruption and in accordance to law.

~4~

Delivery of services to citizens will be made anytime and anywhere through creative uses of ICT such
as one-stop service counters, helpdesks and e-services to ensure not only a higher degree of
efficiency in the delivery mechanism but to improve transparency and accountability within the
government and non-government service provider organizations.
Internally government will improve on the utilization of ICT to promote and standardize best
practices in government. For example ICT based decision support systems will be used to improve
the planning, implementation and monitoring of the government including field administration
personnel. These systems will enable sharing of data and information across various agencies of the
government transcending departments and geographic boundaries. The potential reallocation of
government human resource may result with the automation or digitization of government systems
and services. Government will utilize ICT to facilitate access to services such as financial services,
land registration, business license registration and other public service applications.
ICT will be utilized to support good government practices by developing and enacting policy reform
to ensure the secure ICT services specifically with regard to electronic transactions, security, and
privacy of citizens and including child online protection.

Goal 5: Create an Enabling ICT Environment through Policy Reform and
Improvements in Legal Frameworks
Policy Statement: Government will establish new laws for ICT and develop a strong regulatory
framework that supports a technology-neutral ICT enabling environment and market.
Government will strengthen the legal and policy framework for enabling social and economic
development through ICT by developing a legal and regulatory framework that promotes competition
between service providers, efficient pricing and costs, and universal access and provides oversight of
the telecommunications sector. It is critical that these policies ensure equitable access to ICTenabled services, applications, and content to all and particularly for rural and underserved
populations.
To achieve affordable access, Government will develop an environment that supports a robust ICT
industry that enables fair competition in telecommunications markets. An independent ICT
Regulator will be established to provide oversight of the telecommunications sector. Government
will adopt policies and regulations to promote universal access and will also focus efforts on policies
to encourage greater use of the Internet to provide public services and services for health, education,
and emergency management.

Introduction
Modern ICTs fundamentally change all aspects of social and economic development and relationships
with the establishment of a new information society. New technologies change not only the modes
of production of goods and services but also create new opportunities for the execution of civic
rights, personal self-actualization, the means of obtaining knowledge, providing educational
opportunities for the new generation, preserving culture for future generations and increasing ways
of spending leisure time. In an information society, distances reduce, good governance emerges,
globalization occurs, corruption reduces and unprecedented opportunities for development of
countries and regions are created. FSM does not want to be left behind.
ICT has been globally acknowledged as an essential tool for sustainable social and economic
development, critical for good governance and an effective vehicle of change. FSM has recognized
these essential contributions of ICT and have been actively involved in global, regional, and national
discussions and consultations on ICT guidelines, lessons learnt from other developing countries, and
best practices.
Much work has been done in the FSM gearing towards developing a national ICT policy in the last 10
years. His Excellency President Mori mandated the Department of Transportation, Communications
and Infrastructure to develop a national ICT policy to address the key issues facing the citizens of FSM
because Government embraces the fact that ‘ICT is recognized as a key factor in economic growth
and social development in terms of providing opportunities, choices and access to information and
knowledge.’
This policy provides the strategic direction for ICT development for the Federated States of
Micronesia. It identifies obstacles and difficulties in development of ICT in FSM and outlines policies
to address them. The NICTP further establishes key goals and strategies to implement these policies
addressing priority areas including inequality of access to ICT, ICT Infrastructure, local capacity and
ICT expertise, relatively high ICT costs and the need for an improved telecommunication regulatory
environment.
This National ICT Policy will provide a framework that seeks a coherent, equitable, and focused
utilization of ICT in the FSM for the benefit of the FSM people.

Background
The Federated States of Micronesia (FSM) is made up of four states: Yap, Chuuk, Pohnpei, and
Kosrae. It comprises approximately 607 small islands in the Western Pacific spread over 2,600,000
sq. km of ocean. The FSM’s land area amounts to approximately 700 sq. km. Its population of
around 112,000 is centered on several main islands in each state. The geographic spread of the
islands across the north Pacific is enormous; Yap at the western end is separated from Kosrae in the
east by several thousand miles. Inter-island passenger traffic is almost entirely by air; sea-borne
cargoes are delivered direct to each State by international shippers. ICT offers much potential for
overcoming such vast geographic challenges in the FSM; however, to achieve the full benefits many
ICT and telecommunication issues must be addressed in FSM.
~6~

The ADB conducted a study in 2007 and stated that there is considerable potential for sustainable
development in the FSM but it is restricted due to the monopolies in the telecommunications sector,
and opening of these markets and advancement of the submarine cable to all the states would likely
have a considerable positive impact on the local economies of the FSM. The same study also found
that although infrastructure is well supported with external finance, service delivery improvement
depends on further policy development, particularly in the areas of regulation and market
liberalization, and capacity building in project planning and implementation.
A study by consultants for the World Bank, in 2011, reinforced the study by the ADB and further
articulated the importance and role of market liberalization in telecommunications and economic
development. The World Bank study also reported on the many countries which have liberalized
telecommunications in the Pacific Islands region.
The National Government acknowledges these barriers. The NICT Policy seeks to address these
challenges in order to achieve the overall ICT vision of affordable and accessible communications for
all FSM citizens.

Telecommunication Present Situation
Telecommunication links with remote populated islands are sparse. Mountainous interiors and
dense jungles also add to the challenges in deploying telecommunication infrastructure. According
to ITU statistics, in 2008 FSM had a fixed line penetration rate of 7.88%, a mobile penetration rate of
30.79% and an Internet user penetration rate of 14.49%. The country has around 100 broadband
subscribers.
All telecommunication services including Internet, fixed and mobile telephony are provided by the
FSM Telecom (FSMTC). In 2006 FSMTC upgraded its existing GSM network to a GSM/GPRS/EDGE
network with high-speed packet data service capabilities. In 2011 FSMTC launched a Digital Wireless
TV service in Yap and Chuuk. While FSMTC owned 100% of the cable TV in Kosrae, FSMTC has a 50%
ownership with Island Cable TV for Pohnpei.
A link to the HANTRU-1 submarine fiber optics cable (SFOC) system has been extended to Pohnpei
from Guam in April 2010. The FSM extension is financed through the United States Department of
Agriculture Rural Utilities Service, Telecommunications Loan Program. The spur provides enhanced
connectivity but does not fully use the capacity of the SFOC and does not unleash the potential for
broadband communications for all states to achieve the economic and social benefits of
telecommunications and ICT.
The challenge now is how to link the submarine cable to all the states in the FSM given the
geographical issues described above as well as to develop a national strategy to promote a universal
access to calling and broadband Internet access services including underserved communities in the
FSM. Because of these issues, the President and the Government of FSM embarked on developing its
national ICT policy, with the assistance of the ITU-EC project for Pacific Islands ACP member
countries, to guide the development of ICT throughout the FSM.

~7~

In view of the rapid advancement in telecommunications, it would be unwise to be complacent with
the achievements made so far. If the FSM is to keep pace with the global development and provide
enhanced services and access to Internet based resources, we need to exploit the advances in today’s
technology.

Guiding Principles
A.

Leadership, decision-making and governance

Strong and visionary leadership and robust governance are keys for successful ICT initiatives. A
strong and senior leader is needed to sponsor national ICT implementation efforts and champions are
needed for each important ICT initiative.

B.

Holistic coordinated approach

A disjointed and ‘silo’ approach wastes resources and often results in failure. To maximize the
effectiveness and fully utilize the benefits of ICT, a holistic coordinated approach is needed. Such an
approach can result in a more sustainable long term outcome and minimize risks and disruptions due
to the introduction of new technologies or systems.

C.

Bridging the digital divide

Affordable and accessible ICT reduces the gaps between the ‘haves’ and the ‘have nots’ thereby
enhancing economic opportunity for the people of the FSM. Access to ICT provides affordable
communication, improved access to markets and services, a medium for building stronger social ties,
improved access to education and health services, and better access to information and news.
Competition between service providers is essential to promote service accessibility and affordability.

D.

Sustainable livelihoods, culture, equity and gender

ICT interventions must address the need to reduce inequities, promote access by youth and
differently abled, promote gender sensitivity and culture, improve efforts to reduce poverty across
and within countries and territories; and facilitate equitable access to adequate, reliable, and
affordable ICT and services to improve the FSM communities’ livelihoods.

E.

Using proven technologies: think big, start small, replicate fast

With the limited available resources, the FSM needs cost effective, technically proven, and
appropriate ICT solutions. There is a need to identify the transformative means that deliver values to
FSM communities including ICT sector reforms, new legislative framework to deal with emerging ICT
challenges, and new skills requirements. Taking into account the weaknesses, there is a need to pick
some test and pilot initiatives, especially those that cut across the key sectors and ‘silos’, to gain
experience and in-depth insight into what is needed to fully realize the transformative changes. The
small scale pilot initiatives, if successful, can then be scaled up or implemented on a larger scale in
the country.

F.

Convergence and multi-stakeholder partnership

Convergence means the interlinking of ICT with all media, broadcasting, text, audio, graphics,
animation, and video to be delivered on a common platform while also allowing the user to choose
~8~

any combination of media to interact with. It brings together many disciplines, in particular the
engineering sciences and the social and behavioral sciences. Convergence requires a multistakeholder partnership where: the government can implement enabling policies and regulations
provide funding and build capacity; the private sector can build infrastructure and invest in
services; civil society can work with communities; and communities own and drive initiatives. The
framework will provide guidance on optimizing the opportunities provided by convergence to look
for low-cost solutions.

G.

E-Environment

Protection of the environment is an important issue for FSM. To complement the various
environmental protection initiatives of other sectors, ICT should also play its part in preserving and
safeguarding the environment. Green ICT programs should be established to ensure energy efficient
ICT equipment are used and disposed in an environmentally friendly way. The Pacific legislators in
their 2009 Rarotonga Communiqué on Sustainability, Equity and Accountability, ‘Recognized that
modern ICTs play a vital role in climate change education and awareness, maintaining
communication links in times of disaster and the timely management of disaster response and relief,
and contributing to disaster risk reduction through, for example, the development of early warning
systems’.

H.

Availability of ICT data

Accurate measurement of ICT adoption, use, and impact is crucially important if policymakers are to
make well-informed decisions. Appropriate measures need to be in place and mechanisms
established to ensure integrity of ICT data collected and that statistics are updated and disseminated.

I.

Appropriate investment in human capital

Lack of capacity is an acknowledged fact in the FSM. There are a number of capacity building
initiatives in the Pacific but the issue remains. Scarcity of ICT data and inappropriate monitoring and
evaluation (M&E) systems make it difficult to identify what works and what does not. M&E should be
incorporated into capacity building initiatives but more importantly these initiatives should be needs
based. Efforts to retained trained and qualified ICT personnel must be considered to ensure FSM has
the necessary technical skills required to implement and achieve the goals and strategies of this
National ICT policy.

J.

Many partners, one team

There are many genuine partners and stakeholders in the ICT sector. All have excellent aims with
their respective objectives that are primarily aligned to national needs. It is the intention that the
“many partners, one team” approach be a collaborative response to national priority needs and plans
to minimize duplication of efforts, exploit synergies and maximize the impact. The “many partners,
one team” will be implemented through one implementation plan. That is, all partners will need to
work as one team to implement this policy.

K.

Financing, monitoring and evaluation

There are many regional and international declarations and plan of actions that are relevant to the
implementation and monitoring of the implementation. It is important for FSM to ensure that they
share the national ICT policy with other developing partners planning ICT work in the FSM. Every

effort must be made to ensure that donor funding has realistic monitoring and evaluation principles
attached to such policy documents to ensure that the Government is able to justify the utilization of
such funding.

Policy Context
This policy document sets out the over-arching goals, objectives strategies for the delivery of ICT. It
will form the basis for the development of ICT in the Federated States of Micronesia for the next 3
years.
ICT in nature crosses all public and private sectors. In this context, the National ICT Policy is designed
to integrate and harmonize top-level national priorities and sectoral goals through a participatory,
inclusive, and cohesive approach.
This policy sets the direction to improving government efficiencies by promoting the use of ICT for
internal government functions and supporting the development of eGovernment service for
delivering online public services.
The intent is to create an environment where we are able to exploit the potential of ICT to foster
entrepreneurship, creativity, and innovation, and to seek the best ideas and solutions offered from
the rest of the world, consequently increasing productivity across the economy.
The direction is to develop robust frameworks for ICT policy, services, technical, and human
resources development to enable our participation in an information society and networked
economy. ICT is an inherently democratic and empowering force that presents an unparalleled
opportunity to improve the free flow of information and ideas not only in our country but around the
world.
A digitally connected society also comes with its own challenges and threats. It is therefore essential
that laws and regulations are put in place to enable electronic transactions to take place – but also to
protect individuals, the community, and businesses against cyber-crimes and inappropriate online
content and behavior.
It is also important that our environment is protected. Policies are required to protect our countries
from being used as dumping grounds for obsolete ICT equipment. Wise practices will ensure that ewaste will have minimal to zero impact on the vulnerable environment of our country.
The focus of this policy therefore, is to provide an ICT strategic framework to facilitate policies, laws,
and regulations that promote competition and thereby enable socio-economic development of the
Federated States of Micronesia and to make possible for our citizens and visitors to participate
effectively in the local and global economy.
Responsibility for the implementation of this policy rests with the Department of Transportation,
Communication, and Infrastructure. The Department will issue annual reports on the annual status
of policy implementation.

Internet access services.

A.

Strategy for Objective 1: Promote Competition in the
Telecommunication Market to Achieve Accessible and Affordable
Communications for All

(i)

Amend the FSMTC Act to remove the monopoly powers granted to FSMTC and enact law
to establish the objective of promotion of competition in telecommunications markets,
create independent regulation of those markets, with powers for the regulator to ensure
prompt and fair network interconnection and access to other essential facilities, prevent
anticompetitive behavior, and protect the interests of consumers. The new law will open
the ICT sector to competition by providing for licensing of all network operators and retail
service providers on fair and non-discriminatory terms.

(ii)

The regulator will ensure open access for all licensees to international connectivity
through FSM submarine cable facilities.

(iii)

The Department of Transportation, Communication, and Infrastructure will be responsible
for the development and monitoring of Government policies setting the overall direction
for the sector.

policy and for supporting the new Office of the Regulator.

(vi)

FSMTC will be strengthened and reformed in order to prepare the company to operate
efficiently in a competitive market, including sale of all or part of the government’s
ownership interest in the corporation to private investors, domestic or foreign.

B.

Strategy for Objective 2: Establish an Independent ICT Regulatory
Authority to Promote Competition, Ensure that Prices Reflect
Efficient Costs, Manage Universal Access and Provide Oversight and
Management of the Telecommunications Sector

(i)

Establish an ICT Regulator that is legally, institutionally, and financially independent of the
Government to transparently manage sector regulation in accordance with Government
sector policies. The Government will provide initial funding for the establishment of the
Office of the Regulator. It is however the Government’s intention that once new licenses
have been issued, licensing fees will be applied towards the costs of regulation.

(ii)

The design of the regulatory regime will give weight to suitable options for reducing the
cost of regulation where that can be done without jeopardizing competitive outcomes.
Options may include sharing some regulatory activities with other countries where there
are efficiency gains.

(iii)

The regulator will have the power to:
a)

Issue individual and class licenses on a non-discriminatory and technologically
neutral basis;

b)

Allocate spectrum for the use of licensed network operators and, jointly with the
Ministry, control the national spectrum plan;

c)

Control the national numbering plan and ensure access to numbers for all
licensed operators on a non-discriminatory basis;

d)

Make binding decisions to resolve access disputes between operators, subject
only to judicial review by the FSM Supreme Court for error of law or appeals on
substance to an independent expert;

e)

Investigate and prohibit behavior by any operator that may have the effect of
restricting competition;

f)

Require any dominant operator to submit for prior approval by the regulator any
proposed changes to retail tariffs until such time as the regulator is satisfied that
there is effective competition in that service market;

g)

Investigate consumer complaints, set standard terms, and issue orders
prohibiting unfair or misleading behavior by service providers;

h)

Apply to the FSM Supreme Court to impose penalties in cases of violation of the
Act;

~ 22 ~

i)

Review proposed ownership transactions that could diminish the level of
competition in a relevant market for telecommunications services and decline
permission for such transactions unless satisfied that they are in the public
interest.

j)

Administer any universal access scheme adopted by the government in order to
ensure the availability of access to a minimum standard of voice calling and
Internet access throughout FSM;

k)

Hire staff, establish and operate an office, and incur such expenses as are
properly required for the conduct of the regulatory function;

l)

Set and collect license fees required to meet the costs of the regulatory function;

m)

Make rules and issue regulations as are required within the scope of the new law
to efficiently perform the regulatory function, such rules and regulations to be
tabled in the Congress.

(iv)

The regulator will ensure that qualified and motivated local staff receive ICT regulation
training and leverage international experience.

(v)

If the Pohnpei spur submarine cable and associated assets are transferred out of FSMTC to
a new Government-owned entity, that entity will provide open access to international
connectivity on a cost-based and non-discriminatory basis.

(vi)

Should the transfer of those assets out of FSMTC not be feasible, the regulator will ensure
that access to international connectivity is available to all operators on a cost-based and
non-discriminatory basis.

(vii)

The Department of TC&I shall represent FSM in regional and international ICT regulatory
forums.

(viii)

The Regulator shall supply all relevant Regulations and Legislation and industry data
required for regional performance surveys to the International Telecommunications
Union, the Pacific ICT Regulatory Resource Center, and other relevant organizations as
directed by the Department.

C.

Strategy for Objective 3: Adopt a Universal Access Policy

(i)

The Government will in consultation with the regulator adopt a universal access policy to
achieve ICT access throughout the whole country, to be administered by the regulator. In
order to ensure funding for implementation of the policy, it is likely that the Government
will take a two-fold approach – (1) mandatory coverage obligations imposed on mobile
licensees, and (2) targeted subsidies used to support service expansion in the most remote
and challenging areas. Options for funding a subsidy regime may include a requirement
for licensees to contribute a portion of gross revenues towards those costs. Government
will also explore the opportunity for participation in the United States universal service
fund access program.

(ii)

Investigate and identify different policies and models for supporting increased access
through the shared use of public service telecommunication services for health, education,
emergency management and other public service sectors.
