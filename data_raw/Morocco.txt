AN Extract from the speech
given by HIS Majesty
THE King Mohammed VI

« […] In parallel, we invite the government to adopt a new strategy for the industry and service
sector and for the development of new technologies. This strategy should be focused on the
optimal use of opportunities created by the globalisation in terms of investment flows. In addition
to the reinforcement of Moroccan companies and the promotion of added-value industrial
investment, this strategy should also chart new ways for the Moroccan economy to invest in new
industrial sectors that require innovative technologies and open up promising markets to export
its products and services.
We have both the ambition and the determination to ensure the insertion of Morocco, through
its companies and universities, in the international economy of knowledge. […] »

INTRODUCTION

Information is crucial to the development of nations

• The use of Information Technology (IT) is an essential factor for the emergence of the knowledge of a society, and can actively contribute to human
development, improved social cohesion, and national economy growth.
• Indeed, all around the world, the access to information and its appropriate and effective use have an impact on progress and development. Modern
and prosperous nations enjoy a high index for their capacity to produce and use information.
• The IT sector accounts for 7% of the world GDP and attracts 25% of the world growth as well as 60% of jobs in the industrialised world.
• However, there is a great imbalance between industrial and emerging nations. Industrial nations control around 85% of the sector activities with political,
economic, social, and cultural consequences, the impact of which has only started to be analysed.

INTRODUCTION

Information is crucial to the development of nations

• In accordance with the High Orientations of His Majesty the King Mohammed VI, the IT sector is now one of the priority sectors of Moroccan economy,
given the contribution it can have on human and economic development.
• In the IT sector, the challenge for Morocco in the coming years is not only to build on the progress that has already been made, but to achieve the
integration of Morocco in the global economy of knowledge, by integrating and extending IT to all entities within the society: state, administrations,
companies, and individual citizens.
• Facing this challenge, the national strategy for the information society and digital economy:
• focuses on defining priorities and actions with strong impact, that will be gradually improved;
• s ets ambitious but realistic objectives that can be achieved by putting in place a sustainable system of governance and by allocating adequate
resources.

Challenges
Human and Economic Development

• For Morocco, the major challenge regarding its transformation into an information society is to produce added-value and improve the standard of living
and the well-being of its citizens.
• IT is a key factor in human and economic development, based on:
• effective and efficient use of information, the main factor in the production of added-value, after capital and labour;
• the achievement of significant productivity gains, by creating new opportunities to produce, process, record, store and share information, as well
as by providing easier access to information.
• Thus, developing an efficient use of IT in all areas of economic and social life in Morocco is a priority to ensure sustainable national growth and
competitiveness.

Industry Challenges
Productivity Improvement

• In the 21st century, companies’ ability to collect, produce, and manage information, has become an essential factor for the economic growth, productivity
and competitiveness.
• Thus, the IT penetration rate within companies, particularly within small and medium enterprises (SMEs) and very small enterprises (VSEs), and its
widespread and effective use play a significant role in the emergence of an economy of knowledge, and in the capacity of companies to produce higher
added-value and create further job opportunities.
• In Morocco, the economic arena mainly comprises SMEs and VSEs which have low level of computerisation. As a result, work productivity remains
limited.
• The modernisation of the Moroccan entrepreneurial arena is one of the main challenges of the spread of IT. In opting to put in place an information
system, the company embraces a dynamic step of technological and organisational modernisation, notably to:
• meet the requirements of the industry in terms of quality, costs, and deadlines;
• develop new job processes;
• achieve better productivity.

Challenges
and Opportunities

Individual Citizens Challenges
Access to Knowledge

• IT and access to the internet facilitate communication and provide access to knowledge. Besides providing easy and quick access to information, they
enable individual citizens to considerably save time, especially with the availability of online services.
• It is essential to introduce the benefits of IT to individual citizens, to provide them with opportunities to access these technologies and purchase equipment,
and enable them to acquire the necessary skills for the appropriate use of these technologies.
• In this context, after the progress made regarding individual citizens’ access to mobile phone technology, the next stage should be to accelerate the
process of democratisation of home internet, and to encourage individual citizens to take up and use new technology on a daily basis.
• This is particularly relevant in difficult access areas, where a computer connected to the internet remains the sole mean of link to the world of
knowledge.

Sector Challenges
R&D Promotion

• Morocco has made significant progress in promoting R&D in recent years:
• The number of partnerships with foreign universities and research centers has increased, highlighting the credibility enjoyed by Moroccan
academics and researchers;
• Moroccan researchers are leading R&D teams in innovative areas, such as microelectronics, biotechnology and nanotechnology;
• A support fund for technology innovation has been set up.
• The challenge for the future is to ensure the continuation and to reinforce the cooperation between the research institutes and the private sector to turn
this existing national research potential into marketable technology and products.
• A great interaction between academic researchers and private companies will lead to a greater focus on concrete projects, while enjoying the support
of industrialists, and balancing fundamental and applied research that are oriented toward marketable openings.
• Furthermore, openness to the world is necessary, given the limited size of the local market to justify a significant investment in R&D.

Challenges
and Opportunities

Sector Challenges
Growth of local IT industry

Added-value increase of IT offshoring services
• Morocco has become a leading destination for investment from francophone countries in the field of call centres, IT offshoring, as well as in the outsourcing
of business processes. The main offshoring actors have started operating in Morocco, and have further ambition for their development plans.
• Morocco has significantly contributed to this success by making the offshoring business as one of the pillars of its industrial strategy, and has put in
place a dynamic policy to enhance the attractiveness of Morocco for foreign clients. Overall, some 50 multinational companies have already launched
operations in the country.
• For the future, the challenge resides in the consolidation of our francophone market leadership and our current mature experience in offshoring in order
to expand to new markets and to increase the added-value of the services offered in Morocco.

IT Industry Export Growth
• International companies are also interested in the skills and know-how available in Morocco in several professional areas related to information systems:
monetics, engineering consultancy and information systems integration, geographical information systems, development of digital content in Arabic and
decision systems...
• Morocco should identify and profit from the existing opportunities to rapidly position itself as a reference country in the sector, and to achieve higher
added-value.

Challenges
and Opportunities

Administration Challenges
Improving Efficiency and Reducing Costs

• Public services and their efficiency have an important impact on the country economic and social aspects of living. Thus, it is very important to provide
these services in an integrated, transparent and secure manner so that the Moroccan society can be gradually transformed into an information society,
thanks to IT and in respect to the needs and expectations of the citizens and compagnies.
• In Morocco, the public sector expenditures represent a significant portion of the budget of the State. The public sector will certainly achieve important
profits in terms of effectiveness and effficiency as a result of the implementation of E-government services via simplified and automated information
processing.
• Therefore, for instance, the online Tax declaration for compagnies will allow the Moroccan State to achieve productivity gains by using simplified
collection and automated information processing. In counterpart, it will allow compagnies and their partners to considerably save time by accessing
information that have been already filed while being assisted with the online declaration process.

Initiative 1 : Extending and generalising IT use and equipment to education and teaching entities.

• The information and knowledge society will be only developped if the younger generation acquires the know-how of technology at an early stage.
Computers and internet are the powerful educational tools which can speed up human, economic, and social development.
• Actions designed to provide pupils and students with computer equipment are multiplying worldwide, and their efficiency has been clearly proven.
• To further promote computer equipment and internet use by actors in the education sector, the Moroccan government will implement a leader action to
provide engineering students and their similars with subsidised laptops and internet access.
• This initiative will supplement the ‘Génie’ program for the equipment of primary and high public schools, and the Nafid@ program to subsidise mobile
computers and internet access for teaching staff, launched respectively in September 2005 and May 2008.

Initiative 2 : Mobilising public and private actors around attractive IT access opportunities for each socioprofessional category

• The rapid introduction of internet broadband infrastructure should be considered in relation to an optimal digital development of the territory, and to
reduced cost for internet broadband access, especially in moderately populated zones.
• Given that cost, for a large section of the population, is one of the major barriers to computer purchasing and internet access, within the framework of
the public-private partnership, the government will ensure that attractive and suitable offers, such as computer plus internet, are available to different
sections of the population.
• Similarly, the introduction of public community access centres, drawing on existing telecom infrastructure, will extend access to new technologies to a
wider range of citizens.
• These facilities will focus notably on zones where offers of household internet access are not available or financially inaccessible.

• Define the broad lines of the development of broadband by catagory of the zone (low-cost, residential,
tourism, offshoring, etc.);
• Rationalise investment to provide access in scarcely or moderately populated zones, through the
public-private partnership and/or infrastructure sharing.

6. Promote low-cost equipment

• Make available attractive offers, within the framework of public-private partnership, such as computer
plus internet, suitable to different sections of the population (civil servants, pensioners, retired...).

7. Promote internet access and IT
use outside the home by setting
up community access centers

• Set up 400 public community access centres (CAC) over the 2009-2013 period;
• Each CAC will be equipped with computers, internet access and telephone sets;
• The launch of these CAC will rely on public infrastructure, enabling private operators to provide
affordable multimedia services to citizens (youth centres, girls’ residences, post offices...)

Initiative 3 : Developing national digital content

• Internet penetration and development of national content are very closely linked.
• Primarily destined to Moroccan citizens, such digital content must meet specific needs and expectations, so as to naturally draw interest and arouse
curiosity.
• This would entail the development of attractive online content, as well as the digitalisation of historical and cultural heritage, a major challenge in terms
of visibility and attractiveness of different geographical areas, and more generally, in terms of access to knowledge.
• The development of national digital content must combine governmental action, private initiative, and international partnerships.

Initiative 1 : Setting up a steering committee in charge of the e-government program

• Beyond computerising existing processes and procedures, e-government requires their indepth reconfiguration, on the basis of a real understanding of
the public administration functionning.
• This also requires transversal collaboration between the administrations and relevant bodies, as well as a vision shared between the different entities.
• Governance dedicated to e-government projects is thus imperative to ensure the design of a global strategy and the allocation of necessary funds, and
to manage the effective implementation of decision making process.
• The principles of such governance are as follows :
•D
 efine the government’s common vision and a coherent action plan taking into account government priorities;
•O
 ptimise operation and investment costs of e-government services and projects;
•A
 dopt a personalised approach with the different ministries, administrations and local collectivities, to assist them in implementing their projects and
operating their e-government services;
•B
 e accountable for the results obtained with respect to the defined objectives and to the means of implementation;
•M

SME’s Productivity
Context

SME investment in IT is hindered by lack of awareness as to its profitability, and by resistance to change

“

The low use of IT in the SME is mainly due to the fact that
managers do not believe that investing in IT is very profitable. The
SME manager…, does not know which application suits
their needs and fails to see the relation between the benefits
that such investment generates to the business, and its
long term benefits with the corresponding costs.

”

“

To make the best of IT investment, enterprises should first reach
a certain maturity and have an optimised production
tool and well established processes. The majority of
Moroccan SMEs, especially, small ones, are far from this level of
perception.

”

Designer of a Moroccan software

General Manager of a Computer Service Company

“

Many SMEs in Morocco have not been able to adapt to
the new changes. A good number of Moroccan enterprises still
use pen and paper, and never consider acquiring a computer.

”

Manager of a well-known Moroccan software design company

“

Many small enterprises are used to have liberties with tax
regulations. Computerisation, especially that of their taxation, would
oblige them to be more transparent, and that could be another
reason for their reticence.

Context

Moroccan IT Industry suffers from a weak domestic demand and a limited export opportunity

• Fragmented IT offer;
• Limited domestic demand largely catered by the import of high added value projects;
• Export is limited and has not reached the critical mass to compete at the international level.

IT offshoring has shown rapid growth, creating tension on the market

• IT offshoring growth has exceeded expectations (+270% of turnover based on 2008 forecast);
• The rapid installation of offshorers has induced competition on qualified IT resources;
• Special attention should be given to offshorers already installed.

Morocco may enjoy a competitive edge.
• The challenge is enormous given the size of Moroccan actors in this field compared to international competitors. Nevertheless, Morocco must make
smart approches and master its investment choices in order to use efficiently and effectively the public resources.
• The government has identified priority technology niches to put in place through areas of excellence based on an ecosystem which includes industrial
contractors, universities and researchers, and IT start ups.
• This ecosystem will be fully integrated with international scientific networks and will have a public-private governance structure, to guarantee the viability
of start up projects. These small enterprises will then have easy access to international markets and benefit from Morocco’s sustained efforts to promote
the sector internationally.

Initiative 3 : Updating education programs to enhance IT graduates employement

• The recurrent obligation of IT enterprises to provide training for young graduates represents a significant cost. This results in slowing down the integration
of young graduates in professional life.
• Alongside putting in place new governance and regularly updated training programs, it is necessary to improve the employment rate of IT graduates
by impacting at two levels:
• Effective upstream implication of IT professionals in training programs in partnership with the players of higher education;
• Systematic and significant immersion of IT students within enterprises during their training period.

Digital Confidence
Context

Users’ lack of confidence in secure electronic exchanges constitutes a major barrier for the development
of IT usage

• E-commerce usage is still under-developed for both individuals and enterprises.
• Enterprises consider that they are not fully informed about existing legal regulations and future legal provisions.
• While pedagogic effort on the theme of digital exchanges are necessary, a limited communication campaign towards both enterprises and individuals
hinders the development of IT usage.
