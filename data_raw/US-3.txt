The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy

We live in a wired world. Companies and countries rely on cyberspace for everything from
financial transactions to the movement of military forces. Computer code blurs the line between
the cyber and physical world and connects millions of objects to the Internet or private
networks. Electric firms rely on industrial control systems to provide power to the grid.
Shipping managers use satellites and the Internet to track freighters as they pass through global
sea lanes, and the U.S. military relies on secure networks and data to carry out its missions.
The United States is committed to an open, secure, interoperable, and reliable Internet that
enables prosperity, public safety, and the free flow of commerce and ideas. These qualities of
the Internet reflect core American values – of freedom of expression and privacy, creativity,
opportunity, and innovation. And these qualities have allowed the Internet to provide social
and economic value to billions of people. Within the U.S. economy alone, anywhere from three
to 13 percent of business sector value-added is derived from Internet-related businesses. Over
the last ten years Internet access increased by over two billion people across the globe.. Yet these
same qualities of openness and dynamism that led to the Internet’s rapid expansion now
provide dangerous state and non-state actors with a means to undermine U.S. interests.
We are vulnerable in this wired world. Today our reliance on the confidentiality, availability,
and integrity of data stands in stark contrast to the inadequacy of our cybersecurity. The
Internet was not originally designed with security in mind, but as an open system to allow
scientists and researchers to send data to one another quickly. Without strong investments in
cybersecurity and cyber defenses, data systems remain open and susceptible to rudimentary
and dangerous forms of exploitation and attack. Malicious actors use cyberspace to steal data
and intellectual property for their own economic or political goals. And an actor in one region
of the globe can use cyber capabilities to strike directly at a network thousands of miles away,
destroying data, disrupting businesses, or shutting off critical systems.
State and non-state actors conduct cyber operations to achieve a variety of political, economic,
or military objectives. In conducting their operations, they may strike at a nation’s values as
well as its interests or purposes. As one example, in November, 2014, likely in retaliation for the

planned release of a satirical film, North Korea conducted a cyberattack against Sony Pictures
Entertainment, rendering thousands of Sony computers inoperable and breaching Sony’s
confidential business information. In addition to the destructive nature of the attacks, North
Korea stole digital copies of a number of unreleased movies, as well as thousands of documents
containing sensitive data regarding celebrities,
Sony employees, and Sony’s business operations.
North Korea accompanied their cyberattacks with
coercion, intimidation, and the threat of
terrorism. The North Korean attack on Sony was
one of the most destructive cyberattacks on a U.S.
entity to date. The attack further spurred an
already ongoing national discussion about the
nature of the cyber threat and the need for
improved cybersecurity.
The increased use of cyberattacks as a political
instrument reflects a dangerous trend in
international relations. Vulnerable data systems

Department assumes that a potential adversary
will seek to target U.S. or allied critical infrastructure and military networks to gain a strategic
advantage. Beyond the attacks described above, a sophisticated actor could target an industrial
control system (ICS) on a public utility to affect public safety, or enter a network to manipulate
health records to affect an individual’s well-being. A disruptive, manipulative, or destructive
cyberattack could present a significant risk to U.S. economic and national security if lives are
lost, property destroyed, policy objectives harmed, or economic interests affected.
Leaders must take steps to mitigate cyber risks. Governments, companies, and organizations
must carefully prioritize the systems and data that they need to protect, assess risks and
hazards, and make prudent investments in cybersecurity and cyber defense capabilities to
achieve their security goals and objectives. Behind these defense investments, organizations of
every kind must build business continuity plans and be ready to operate in a degraded cyber
environment where access to networks and data is uncertain. To mitigate risks in cyberspace
requires a comprehensive strategy to counter and if necessary withstand disruptive and
destructive attacks.
Defending the United States in Cyberspace
In concert with other agencies, the United States’ Department of Defense (DoD) is responsible
for defending the U.S. homeland and U.S. interests from attack, including attacks that may
occur in cyberspace. In a manner consistent with U.S. and international law, the Department of
Defense seeks to deter attacks and defend the United States against any adversary that seeks to
harm U.S. national interests during times of peace, crisis, or conflict. To this end the Defense
Department has developed capabilities for cyber operations and is integrating those capabilities
into the full array of tools that the United States government uses to defend U.S. national
interests, including diplomatic, informational, military, economic, financial, and law
enforcement tools.
2

The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy

The May 2011 Department of Defense Strategy for Operating in Cyberspace guided the Defense
Department’s cyber activities and operations in support of U.S. national interests over the last
four years. This new strategy sets prioritized strategic goals and objectives for DoD’s cyber
activities and missions to achieve over the next five years. It focuses on building capabilities for
effective cybersecurity and cyber operations to defend DoD networks, systems, and
information; defend the nation against cyberattacks of significant consequence; and support
operational and contingency plans. This strategy builds on previous decisions regarding DoD’s
Cyber Mission Force and cyber workforce development and provides new and specific
guidance to mitigate anticipated risks and capture opportunities to strengthen U.S. national
security.
As a matter of first principle, cybersecurity is a team effort within the U.S. Federal government.
To succeed in its missions the Defense Department must operate in partnership with other
Departments and Agencies, international allies and partners, state and local governments, and,
most importantly, the private sector.
Cybersecurity Activities
To support its missions in cyberspace, the Defense Department conducts a range of activities
outside of cyberspace to improve collective cybersecurity and protect U.S. interests. For
example, the Defense Department cooperates with agencies of the U.S government, with the
private sector, and with our international partners to share information, build alliances and
partnerships, and foster norms of responsible behavior to improve global strategic stability.


Information sharing and interagency coordination. To secure and advance U.S. interests in
cyberspace, DoD seeks to share information and coordinate with U.S. government agencies
in an integrated fashion on a range of cyber activities. For example, if DoD learns of
malicious cyber activities that will affect important U.S. networks and systems that are vital
for U.S. national and economic security or public safety, DoD supports agencies like the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) as
they reach out to U.S. entities, and often other countries, to share threat information such as
technical indicators of a potential attack. Such
information sharing can significantly improve
an organization’s ability to defend itself
against a broad range of cyberattacks. In
addition to sharing information, DoD
partners with other agencies of the U.S.
government to synchronize operations and to
share lessons-learned and cybersecurity bestpractices. This includes incident management
and network defense response.



Build bridges to the private sector. From
application developers to Internet Services
Providers, private companies provide the
goods and services that make up cyberspace.
The Defense Department relies on the private
sector to build its networks, provide
cybersecurity services, and research and

develop advanced capabilities. The Defense Department has benefited from private sector
innovation throughout its history. Going forward, DoD will work closely with the private
sector to validate and commercialize new ideas for cybersecurity for the Department.


Building alliances, coalitions, and partnerships abroad. The Defense Department engages
in a broad array of activities to improve cybersecurity and cyber operations capacity abroad.
DoD helps U.S. allies and partners to understand the cyber threats they face and to build the
cyber capabilities necessary to defend their networks and data. Allies and partners also
often have complementary capabilities that can augment those of the United States, and the
United States seeks to build strong alliances and coalitions to counter potential adversaries’
cyber activities. Strategically, a unified coalition sends a message that the United States and
its allies and partners are aligned in collective defense. In addition to the Five Eyes treaty
partners, DoD works closely with key partners in the Middle East, the Asia-Pacific, and
Europe to understand the cybersecurity environment and build cyber defense capacity.

Three Primary Missions in Cyberspace
The President has established principles and processes for governing cyber operations. The
purpose of these principles and processes is to plan, develop, and use U.S. capabilities
effectively, and to ensure that cyber operations occur in a manner consistent with the values
that the United States promotes domestically and internationally.
The Defense Department has three primary cyber missions. First, DoD must defend its own
networks, systems, and information. The U.S. military’s dependence on cyberspace for its
operations led the Secretary of Defense in 2011 to declare cyberspace as an operational domain
for purposes of organizing, training, and equipping U.S. military forces. The Defense
Department must be able to secure its own networks against attack and recover quickly if
security measures fail. To this end, DoD conducts network defense operations on an ongoing
basis to securely operate the Department of Defense Information Network (DoDIN). If and
when DoD detects indications of hostile activity within its networks, DoD has quick-response
capabilities to close or mitigate vulnerabilities and secure its networks and systems. Network
defense operations on DoD networks constitute the vast majority of DoD’s operations in
cyberspace.
In addition to defense investments, DoD must prepare and be ready to operate in an
environment where access to cyberspace is contested. During the Cold War, forces prepared to
operate in an environment where access to communications could be interrupted by the
adversary’s advanced capabilities, to include the potential use of an electromagnetic pulse that
could disrupt satellite and other global communications capabilities. Commanders conducted
periodic exercises that required their teams to operate without access to communications
systems. Through years of practice and exercise, a culture of resilience took root in the military
and units were ready and prepared to operate in contested environments.
Since the end of the Cold War, however, a younger generation has grown increasingly more
accustomed to an environment of connectivity. The generation of military men and women that
grew up since the end of the Cold War have had near constant access to information and
communications, and the information revolution has led to a more agile and globally adaptive
force. In the face of an escalating cyber threat, the lessons of the previous generations must now
be passed down. The Defense Department must be able to carry out its missions to defend the

4

The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy

country. Organizations must exercise and learn to operate without the tools that have become
such a vital part of their daily lives and operations.
For its second mission, DoD must be prepared to
defend the United States and its interests against
cyberattacks of significant consequence. While
cyberattacks are assessed on a case-by-case and factspecific basis by the President and the U.S. national
security team, significant consequences may include
loss of life, significant damage to property, serious
adverse U.S. foreign policy consequences, or serious
economic impact on the United States.
If directed by the President or the Secretary of
Defense, the U.S. military may conduct cyber
operations to counter an imminent or on-going
attack against the U.S. homeland or U.S. interests in
cyberspace. The purpose of such a defensive Navy Petty Officer 1st Class Joel Melendez, Naval Network Warfare
measure is to blunt an attack and prevent the Command information systems analysis, Air Force Staff Sgt. Rogerick

Force Base, NV. (U.S. Air Force photo by Senior Airman Matthew
government agencies to develop a range of options Lancaster)
and methods for disrupting cyberattacks of
significant consequence before they can have an impact, to include law enforcement,
intelligence, and diplomatic tools. As a matter of principle, the United States will seek to
exhaust all network defense and law enforcement options to mitigate any potential cyber risk to
the U.S. homeland or U.S. interests before conducting a cyberspace operation.
The United States government has a limited and specific role to play in defending the nation
against cyberattacks of significant consequence. The private sector owns and operates over
ninety percent of all of the networks and infrastructure of cyberspace and is thus the first line of
defense. One of the most important steps for improving the United States’ overall cybersecurity
posture is for companies to prioritize the networks and data that they must protect and to invest
in improving their own cybersecurity. While the U.S. government must prepare to defend the
country against the most dangerous attacks, the majority of intrusions can be stopped through
relatively basic cybersecurity investments that companies can and must make themselves.
Third, if directed by the President or the Secretary of Defense, DoD must be able to provide
integrated cyber capabilities to support military operations and contingency plans. There
may be times when the President or the Secretary of Defense may determine that it would be
appropriate for the U.S. military to conduct cyber operations to disrupt an adversary’s militaryrelated networks or infrastructure so that the U.S. military can protect U.S. interests in an area
of operations. For example, the United States military might use cyber operations to terminate
an ongoing conflict on U.S. terms, or to disrupt an adversary’s military systems to prevent the
use of force against U.S. interests. United States Cyber Command (USCYBERCOM) may also be
directed to conduct cyber operations, in coordination with other U.S. government agencies as
appropriate, to deter or defeat strategic threats in other domains.

5

The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy

To ensure that the Internet remains open, secure, and prosperous, the United States will always
conduct cyber operations under a doctrine of restraint, as required to protect human lives and
to prevent the destruction of property. As in other domains of operations, in cyberspace the
Defense Department will always act in a way that reflects enduring U.S. values, including
support for the rule of law, as well as respect and protection of the freedom of expression and
privacy, the free flow of information, commerce, and ideas. Any decision to conduct cyber
operations outside of DoD networks is made with the utmost care and deliberation and under
strict policy and operational oversight, and in accordance with the law of armed conflict. As it
makes its investments and builds cyber capabilities to defend U.S. national interests, the
Defense Department will always be attentive to the potential impact of defense policies on state
and non-state actors’ behavior.
A New Cyber Mission Force
The Defense Department requires the commitment and coordination of multiple leaders and
communities across DoD and the broader U.S. government to carry out its missions and execute
this strategy. Defense Department law enforcement, intelligence, counterintelligence, and policy
organizations all have an active role, as do the men and women that build and operate DoD’s
networks and information technology systems. Every organization needs to play its part. For
example, network service providers across DoD must be adaptive and active to follow
cybersecurity best-practices and cyber defense orders. U.S. Cyber Command must synchronize
its activities with other DoD organizations, particularly combatant commands, to respond to
emerging challenges and opportunities. Installation owners and operators must partner with
the Military Departments’ Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs), DHS, and
USCYBERCOM to build adaptive defenses and continuity plans for mission-critical systems and
the civil systems that support them. Success requires creative and strong intra-Departmental
and interagency partnerships.
Among DoD’s cyber personnel and forces, the Cyber Mission Force (CMF) has a unique role
within the Department. In 2012, DoD began to build a CMF to carry out DoD’s cyber missions.
Once fully operational, the CMF will include nearly 6,200 military, civilian, and contractor
support personnel from across the military departments and defense components. The Cyber
Mission Force represents a major investment by the Department of Defense and the United
States as whole, and a central aim of this strategy is to set specific goals and objectives to guide
the development of the Cyber Mission Force and DoD’s wider cyber workforce to protect and
defend U.S. national interests.
The Cyber Mission Force will be comprised of cyber operators organized into 133 teams,
primarily aligned as follows: Cyber Protection Forces will augment traditional defensive
measures and defend priority DoD networks and systems against priority threats; National
Mission Forces and their associated support teams will defend the United States and its
interests against cyberattacks of significant consequence; and Combat Mission Forces and their
associated support teams will support combatant commands by generating integrated
cyberspace effects in support of operational plans and contingency operations. Combatant
commands integrate Combat Mission Forces and Cyber Protection Teams into plans and
operations and employ them in cyberspace, while the National Mission Force operates under
the Commander of USCYBERCOM. Outside of this construct, teams can also be used to
support other missions as required by the Department.
6

The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy

In 2013 the Department began to integrate the CMF into the larger multi-mission U.S. military
force to achieve synergy across domains, assure the CMF’s readiness within the force, and
restructure the military and civilian workforce and infrastructure to execute DoD’s missions.
During the course of implementing this
strategy, DoD will continue to build the CMF,
and will continue to mature the necessary
command, control, and enabling organizations
required for effective operations. DoD will focus
on ensuring that its forces are trained and ready
to operate using the capabilities and
architectures they need to conduct cyber
operations, continue to build policy and legal
frameworks to govern CMF employment, and
integrate the CMF into DoD’s overall planning
and force development.
This strategy recognizes that effective
cybersecurity will require close collaboration

The pursuit of security in cyberspace requires a
whole-of-government and international approach due to the number and variety of
stakeholders in the domain, the flow of information across international borders, and the
distribution of responsibilities, authorities, and capabilities across governments and the private
sector. For each of DoD’s missions, DoD must continue to develop routine relationships and
processes for coordinating its cyber operations.
Specific risks and opportunities inform this new strategy. For example, DoD’s own network is a
patchwork of thousands of networks across the globe, and DoD lacks the visibility and
organizational structure required to defend its diffuse networks effectively. The Defense
Department must further develop adequate warning intelligence of adversary intentions and
capabilities for conducting destructive and disruptive cyberattacks against DoD and the United
States. Beyond its own networks, DoD relies on civil critical infrastructure across the United
States and overseas for its operations, yet the cybersecurity of such critical infrastructure is
uncertain.
To mitigate these and other risks and improve U.S. national security, this strategy sets strategic
goals for the Department to achieve, and prescribes objectives and metrics for meeting each
goal. All of the goals and objectives within this strategy reflect the goals of the 2015 United
States National Security Strategy and the 2014 Quadrennial Defense Review.
DoD sets five strategic goals for its cyberspace missions:
1. Build and maintain ready forces and capabilities to conduct cyberspace operations;
2. Defend the DoD information network, secure DoD data, and mitigate risks to DoD
missions;

7

3. Be prepared to defend the U.S. homeland and U.S. vital interests from disruptive or
destructive cyberattacks of significant consequence;
4. Build and maintain viable cyber options and plan to use those options to control conflict
escalation and to shape the conflict environment at all stages;
5. Build and maintain robust international alliances and partnerships to deter shared threats
and increase international security and stability.

The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy

Key Cyber Threats
From 2013-2015, the Director of National Intelligence named the cyber threat as the number one
strategic threat to the United States, placing it ahead of terrorism for the first time since the
attacks of September 11, 2001. Potential state and non-state adversaries conduct malicious cyber
activities against U.S. interests globally and in a manner intended to test the limits of what the
United States and the international community will tolerate. Actors may penetrate U.S.
networks and systems for a variety of reasons, such as to steal intellectual property, disrupt an
organization’s operations for activist purposes, or to conduct disruptive and destructive attacks
to achieve military objectives.
Potential adversaries have invested significantly in cyber as it provides them with a viable,
plausibly deniable capability to target the U.S. homeland and damage U.S. interests. Russia and
China have developed advanced cyber capabilities and strategies. Russian actors are stealthy in
their cyber tradecraft and their intentions are sometimes difficult to discern. China steals
intellectual property (IP) from global businesses to benefit Chinese companies and undercut
U.S. competitiveness. While Iran and North Korea have less developed cyber capabilities, they
have displayed an overt level of hostile intent towards the United States and U.S. interests in
cyberspace.
In addition to state-based threats, non-state actors like the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant
(ISIL) use cyberspace to recruit fighters and disseminate propaganda and have declared their
intent to acquire disruptive and destructive cyber capabilities. Criminal actors pose a
considerable threat in cyberspace, particularly to financial institutions, and ideological groups
often use hackers to further their political objectives. State and non-state threats often also
blend together; patriotic entities often act as cyber surrogates for states, and non-state entities
can provide cover for state-based operators. This behavior can make attribution more difficult
and increases the chance of miscalculation.
Malware Proliferation
The global proliferation of malicious code or software (“malware”) increases the risk to U.S.
networks and data. To conduct a disruptive or destructive cyber operation against a military
system or industrial control system requires expertise, but a potential adversary need not spend
9

The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy

billions of dollars to develop an offensive capability. A nation-state, non-state group, or
individual actor can purchase destructive malware and other capabilities on the black market.
State and non-state actors also pay experts to search for vulnerabilities and develop exploits.
This practice has created a dangerous and uncontrolled market that serves multiple actors
within the international system, often for competing purposes. As cyber capabilities become
more readily available over time, the Department of Defense assesses that state and non-state
actors will continue to seek and develop cyber capabilities to use against U.S. interests.
Risk to DoD Networks and Infrastructure
The Defense Department’s own networks and systems are vulnerable to intrusions and attacks.
In addition to DoD’s own networks, a cyberattack on the critical infrastructure and key
resources on which DoD relies for its operations could impact the U.S. military’s ability to
operate in a contingency. DoD has made gains in identifying cyber vulnerabilities of its own
critical assets through its Mission Assurance Program – for many key assets, DoD has identified
its physical network infrastructure on which key physical assets depend – but more must be
done to secure DoD’s cyber infrastructure.
In addition to destructive and disruptive attacks, cyber actors steal operational information and
intellectual property from a range of U.S. government and commercial entities that impact the
Defense Department. Victims include weapons developers as well as commercial firms that
support force movements through U.S. Transportation Command (USTRANSCOM). State
actors have stolen DoD’s intellectual property to undercut the United States’ strategic and
technological advantage and to benefit their own military and economic development.
Finally, the Defense Department faces a risk from the U.S. government’s continued budgetary
uncertainty. Although DoD has prioritized the allocation of resources in its budget to develop
cyber capabilities, continued fiscal uncertainty requires that DoD plan to build its cyber
capabilities under a declining overall defense budget. DoD must continue to prioritize its cyber
investments and develop the capabilities required to defend U.S. interests at home and
overseas.
Deterrence in the Future Security Environment
In the face of an escalating threat, the Department of Defense must contribute to the
development and implementation of a comprehensive cyber deterrence strategy to deter key
state and non-state actors from conducting cyberattacks against U.S. interests. Because of the
variety and number of state and non-state cyber actors in cyberspace and the relative
availability of destructive cyber tools, an effective deterrence strategy requires a range of
policies and capabilities to affect a state or non-state actors’ behavior.
As DoD builds its Cyber Mission Force and overall capabilities, DoD assumes that the
deterrence of cyberattacks on U.S. interests will not be achieved through the articulation of
cyber policies alone, but through the totality of U.S. actions, including declaratory policy,
substantial indications and warning capabilities, defensive posture, effective response
procedures, and the overall resiliency of U.S. networks and systems. The deterrence of state and
non-state groups in cyberspace will thus require the focused attention of multiple U.S.
government departments and agencies. The Department of Defense has a number of specific
roles to play in this equation.

10

The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy

Deterrence is partially a function of perception. It works by convincing a potential adversary
that it will suffer unacceptable costs if it conducts an attack on the United States, and by
decreasing the likelihood that a potential adversary’s attack will succeed. The United States
must be able to declare or display effective response capabilities to deter an adversary from
initiating an attack; develop effective defensive capabilities to deny a potential attack from
succeeding; and strengthen the overall resilience of U.S. systems to withstand a potential attack
if it penetrates the United States’ defenses. In addition, the United States requires strong
intelligence, forensics, and indications and warning capabilities to reduce anonymity in
cyberspace and increase confidence in attribution.


Response: The United States has been clear that it will respond to a cyberattack on U.S.
interests through its defense capabilities. The United States has articulated this
declaratory policy in the 2011 United States International Strategy for Cyberspace, in the
Department of Defense Cyberspace Policy Report to Congress of 2011, and through
public statements by the President and the Secretary of Defense. The United States will
continue to respond to cyberattacks against U.S. interests at a time, in a manner, and in a
place of our choosing, using appropriate instruments of U.S. power and in accordance
with applicable law.



Denial: While DoD has made progress in
building the Cyber Mission Force, DoD
must increase its defensive capabilities to
defend DoD networks and defend the
nation from sophisticated cyberattacks,
and must work with other departments,
agencies,
international
allies
and
partners, and the private sector to
strengthen deterrence by denial through
improved cybersecurity.

Resilience:

disruptive or destructive cyberattacks on DoD networks. The Defense Department
cannot, however, foster resilience in organizations that fall outside of its authority. In
order for resilience to succeed as a factor in effective deterrence, other agencies of the
government must work with critical infrastructure owners and operators and the private
sector more broadly to develop resilient and redundant systems that can withstand a
potential attack. Effective resilience measures can help convince potential adversaries of
the futility of commencing cyberattacks on U.S. networks and systems.

Attribution is a fundamental part of an effective cyber deterrence strategy as anonymity enables
malicious cyber activity by state and non-state groups. On matters of intelligence, attribution,
and warning, DoD and the intelligence community have invested significantly in all source

11

The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy

collection, analysis, and dissemination capabilities, all of which reduce the anonymity of state
and non-state actor activity in cyberspace. Intelligence and attribution capabilities help to
unmask an actor’s cyber persona, identify the attack’s point of origin, and determine tactics,
techniques, and procedures. Attribution enables the Defense Department or other agencies to
conduct response and denial operations against an incoming cyberattack.
Public and private attribution can play a significant role in dissuading cyber actors from
conducting attacks in the first place. The Defense Department will continue to collaborate
closely with the private sector and other agencies of the U.S. government to strengthen
attribution. This work will be especially important for deterrence as activist groups, criminal
organizations, and other actors acquire advanced cyber capabilities over time.
Finally, cyber capabilities present state and non-state actors with the ability to strike at U.S.
interests in a manner that may or may not necessarily warrant a purely military response by the
United States, but which may nonetheless present a significant threat to U.S. national security
and may warrant a non-military response of some kind. In response to certain attacks and
intrusions, the United States may undertake diplomatic actions, take law enforcement actions,
and consider economic sanctions.
For example, the United States used verifiable and attributable data to engage China about the
risks posed by its economic espionage. The attribution of this data allowed the United States to
express concerns regarding the impact of Chinese intellectual property theft on U.S. economic
competitiveness, and the potential risks posed to strategic stability by Chinese activity. Because
they broke the law and to deter China from conducting future cyber espionage, the Justice
Department indicted five members of the People’s Liberation Army for stealing U.S. intellectual
property to directly benefit Chinese companies. The Defense Department will support the
Justice Department and other agencies in exploring new tools and capabilities to help deter such
activity in cyberspace.

III. STRATEGIC GOALS

To mitigate risks and defend U.S. interests in the current and future security environment, the
Defense Department outlines five strategic goals and specific objectives for its activities and
missions.

STRATEGIC GOAL I: BUILD AND MAINTAIN
TO CONDUCT CYBERSPACE OPERATIONS.

READY FORCES AND CAPABILITIES

To operate effectively in cyberspace, DoD requires forces and personnel that are trained to the
highest standard, ready, and equipped with best-in-class technical capabilities. In 2013 DoD
initiated a major investment in its cyber personnel and technologies by initiating the CMF; now
DoD must make good on that investment by training its people, building effective organizations
and command and control systems, and fully developing the capabilities that DoD requires to
operate in cyberspace. This strategy sets specific objectives for DoD to meet as it mans, trains,
and equips its forces and personnel over the next five years and beyond.

STRATEGIC GOAL II: DEFEND THE DOD INFORMATION
DOD DATA, AND MITIGATE RISKS TO DOD MISSIONS.

NETWORK, SECURE

While DoD cannot defend every network and system against every kind of intrusion – DoD’s
total network attack surface is too large to defend against all threats and too vast to close all
vulnerabilities – DoD must take steps to identify, prioritize, and defend its most important
networks and data so that it can carry out its missions effectively. DoD must also plan and
exercise to operate within a degraded and disrupted cyber environment in the event that an
attack on DoD’s networks and data succeeds, or if aspects of the critical infrastructure on which
DoD relies for its operational and contingency plans are disrupted.
Finally, DoD must raise the bar on technology and innovation to stay ahead of the threat by
enhancing its cyber defense capabilities, including by building and employing a more
defendable network architecture in the Joint Information Environment (JIE). Outside of DoD
networks, DoD must work with the private sector to help secure defense industrial base trade

data, and be prepared to assist other agencies in hardening U.S. networks and data against
cyberattacks and cyber espionage.

STRATEGIC GOAL III: BE PREPARED TO DEFEND THE U.S. HOMELAND AND U.S.
VITAL INTERESTS FROM DISRUPTIVE OR DESTRUCTIVE CYBERATTACKS OF
SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCE.

STRATEGIC GOAL IV: BUILD

The Department of Defense must work with its
interagency partners, the private sector, and allied
and partner nations to deter and if necessary defeat a
cyberattack of significant consequence on the U.S.
homeland and U.S. interests. The Defense
Department must develop its intelligence, warning,
and operational capabilities to mitigate sophisticated,
malicious cyberattacks before they can impact U.S.
interests. Consistent with all applicable laws and
policies, DoD requires granular, detailed, predictive,
and actionable intelligence about global networks
and systems, adversary capabilities, and malware
brokers and markets. To defend the nation, DoD
must build partnerships with other agencies of the
government to prepare to conduct combined cyber
operations to deter and if necessary defeat aggression
in cyberspace. The Defense Department is focused on
building the capabilities, processes, and plans
necessary to succeed in this mission.

AND MAINTAIN VIABLE CYBER OPTIONS AND

PLAN TO USE THOSE OPTIONS TO CONTROL CONFLICT ESCALATION AND TO
SHAPE THE CONFLICT ENVIRONMENT AT ALL STAGES.
During heightened tensions or outright hostilities, DoD must be able to provide the President
with a wide range of options for managing conflict escalation. If directed, DoD should be able to
use cyber operations to disrupt an adversary’s command and control networks, military-related
critical infrastructure, and weapons capabilities. As a part of the full range of tools available to
the United States, DoD must develop viable cyber options and integrate those options into
Departmental plans. DoD will develop cyber capabilities to achieve key security objectives with
precision, and to minimize loss of life and destruction of property. To ensure unity of effort,
DoD will enable combatant commands to plan and synchronize cyber operations with kinetic
operations across all domains of military operations.

STRATEGIC GOAL V: BUILD

AND MAINTAIN

ROBUST INTERNATIONAL

ALLIANCES AND PARTNERSHIPS TO DETER SHARED THREATS AND INCREASE
INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AND STABILITY.
All three of DoD’s cyber missions require close collaboration with foreign allies and partners. In
its international cyber engagement DoD seeks to build partnership capacity in cybersecurity
and cyber defense, and to deepen operational partnerships where appropriate.
Given the high demand and relative scarcity of cyber resources, the Department of Defense
must make hard choices and focus its partnership capacity initiatives on areas where vital U.S.
national interests are stake. Over the next five years, in addition to ongoing partner capacity
building efforts in other regions, DoD will focus its international engagement on: the Middle
East, the Asia-Pacific, and key NATO allies. Through the course of this strategy DoD will
constantly assess the international environment and develop innovative partnerships to
respond to emerging challenges and opportunities.

IV. IMPLEMENTATION OBJECTIVES

Each of DoD’s strategic goals requires specific, measurable objectives for the Department to
achieve. The Office of the Principal Cyber Advisor to the Secretary of Defense, the Office of the
Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, and the Joint Staff will
work with DoD components to prioritize and oversee the implementation of this strategy and
its objectives and to assign offices of primary and support responsibility for managing each
objective. The office of primary responsibility will develop a project plan for each objective; the
Principal Cyber Advisor will track progress in achieving each objective and ultimately the
success of each strategic goal.

STRATEGIC GOAL I: BUILD AND MAINTAIN
TO CONDUCT CYBERSPACE OPERATIONS.


READY FORCES AND CAPABILITIES

Build the cyber workforce. To make good on DoD’s significant investment in cyber
personnel, and to help achieve many of the objectives in this strategy, DoD’s first priority is
to develop a ready Cyber Mission Force and associated cyber workforce. This workforce
will be built on three foundational pillars: enhanced training; improved military and civilian
recruitment and retention; and stronger private sector support.
o

Maintain a persistent training environment. DoD requires an individual and collective
training capability to achieve the goals outlined in this strategy and to meet future
operational requirements. U.S. Cyber Command will work with other components,
agencies, and military departments to define the requirements for and create a training
environment that will enable the total cyber force to conduct joint training (including
exercises and mission rehearsals), experimentation, certification, as well as the
assessment and development of cyber capabilities and tactics, techniques, and
procedures for missions that cross boundaries and networks.

17

The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy



o

Build viable career paths. Throughout the course of this strategy, and following the
CMF decisions of 2013, DoD will continue to foster viable career paths for all military
personnel performing and supporting cyber operations.

o

Draw on the National Guard and Reserve. Throughout the course of this strategy, DoD
will draw on the National Guard and Reserve Components as a resource for expertise
and to foster creative solutions to cybersecurity problems. The Reserve Component
offers a unique capability for supporting each of DoD’s missions, including for engaging
the defense industrial base and the commercial sector. It represents DoD’s critical surge
capacity for cyber responders.

o

Improve civilian recruitment and retention. In addition to developing highly-skilled
military personnel, DoD must recruit and retain highly-skilled civilian personnel,
including technical personnel for its total cyber workforce. Civilians must follow a welldeveloped career development and advancement track and be provided with best-inclass opportunities to develop and succeed within the workforce.

o

Develop and implement exchange programs with the private sector. To supplement
DoD’s civilian cyber workforce, DoD must be able to employ technical subject matter
experts from the best cybersecurity and information technology companies in the
country to perform unique engineering and analytic roles within DoD. The Defense
Department will implement successful private sector exchange programs to bring
measurable benefits to the Department of Defense through the design and development
of new operational concepts for DoD’s cyberspace missions.

o

Support the National Initiative for Cyberspace Education. DoD will develop policies to
support the National Initiative for Cybersecurity Education. Working with interagency
partners, one or more educational institutions, as well as state and private sector
partners, DoD will continue to support innovative workforce development partnerships
focused on both the technical and policy dimensions of cybersecurity and cyber defense.

Build technical capabilities for cyber operations. In 2013, DoD developed a model for
achieving CMF readiness and for developing viable cyber military options to present to the
President and Secretary of Defense. DoD must have the technical tools available to conduct
operations in support of combatant command missions. Key initiatives include the
following:
o

Develop the Unified Platform. On the basis of planning requirements, DoD will
develop the detailed requirements for integrating disparate cyber platforms and
building an interoperable and extendable network of cyber capabilities. This Unified
Platform will enable the CMF to conduct full-spectrum cyberspace operations in support
of national requirements.

o

Accelerate research and development. The Defense Department will continue to
accelerate innovative cyber research and development to build cyber capabilities. The
18

The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy

DoD research and development community as well as established and emerging private
sector partners can provide DoD and the nation with a significant advantage in
developing leap-ahead technologies to defend U.S. interests in cyberspace. In addition to
supporting current and planned investments, DoD will focus its basic and applied
research agenda on developing cyber capabilities to expand the capacity of the CMF and
the broader DoD cyber workforce.


Validate and continually refine an adaptive command and control mechanism for cyber
operations. DoD has made significant progress in recent years in developing command and
control for all three of its missions, but its command and control model must be finalized,
resourced, and tested to ensure effectiveness. The command and control model must
support USCYBERCOM and the combatant commands. It must be efficient and practical,
and must promote unity of effort of effort across all three cyber missions.



Establish an enterprise-wide cyber modeling and simulation capability. DoD will work in
collaboration with the intelligence community to develop the data schema, databases,
algorithms, and modeling and simulation (M&S) capabilities necessary to assess the
effectiveness of cyber operations.



Assess Cyber Mission Force capacity.
Assess the capacity of the projected Cyber
Mission Force to achieve its mission
objectives when confronted with multiple
contingencies.
o

The Joint Staff, with support from
USCYBERCOM
and
other
DoD
components, will propose, collect,
analyze, and report a set of appropriate
metrics to the Principal Cyber Advisor to
measure the operational capacity of the Air Force Tech Sgt. Kevin Garner and Air Force Senior Airman David
cyber transport technicians assigned to the 354 th Communications
CMF. These metrics will include updates Solnok,
Squadron, hook cables in to the new Air Force Network router system at

contingency capabilities, to include Boitz)
capability development and proficiency as well as accesses and tools that may be
required in a contingency. In response to this analysis, DoD will develop a plan for
ensuring that the CMF has the appropriate capacity and flexibility available to respond
to changes in the strategic environment.

STRATEGIC GOAL II: DEFEND THE DOD INFORMATION
DOD DATA, AND MITIGATE RISKS TO DOD MISSIONS.


NETWORK, SECURE

Build the Joint Information Environment (JIE) single security architecture. The Defense
Department will build DoD information networks to meet the JIE’s single security

19

The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy

architecture. The single security architecture will adapt and evolve to mitigate cyber threats;
it will help DoD to develop and follow best-in-class cybersecurity practices, and its small
network footprint will allow USCYBERCOM, combatant commands, and DoD components
to maintain comprehensive situational awareness of network threats and mitigations.
o

The JIE’s single security architecture will enable a robust network defense and shift the
focus from protecting service-specific networks and systems to securing the DoD
enterprise in a unified manner. The JIE’s single security architecture must be developed
with enhanced cyber situational awareness, deployed in response to validated
requirements, and able to accommodate future defensive measures.

o

As a part of JIE planning DoD will develop a framework for developing and integrating
new defensive techniques into DoD’s cybersecurity architecture, to include anomalybased detection capabilities, data analytics to identify vulnerabilities and threats, and
advanced encryption methods.



Assess and ensure the effectiveness of the Joint Force Headquarters for DoD information
network (DoDIN) operations. Operating under USCYBERCOM, the Joint Force
Headquarters-DoDIN will coordinate network defense and mitigate cyber risks to DoD
operations and missions across the defense enterprise. DoD will assess, validate, and fully
implement the Joint Force Headquarters-DoDIN concept to operate DoD networks securely,
defend DoD networks, and mitigate cyber risks to DoD missions.



Mitigate known vulnerabilities. The Defense Department will implement a capability to
mitigate all known vulnerabilities that present a high risk to DoD networks and data. In
addition to zero-day vulnerabilities, one of the greatest threats to DoD networks and
systems lies in known, high-risk vulnerabilities that potential adversaries can exploit. DoD
often finds itself rushing to close vulnerabilities once an adversary has penetrated a system.
The DoD Chief Information Officer (CIO) will lead an effort to implement an automated
patch management capability to distribute software and configuration patches, updates, and
fixes to mitigate known, major vulnerabilities on DoD networks and systems against threats.



Assess DoD’s cyber defense forces. The Defense Department will assess its cyber defense
forces’ ability to conduct integrated, adaptive, and dynamic defensive operations.
Enterprise-level and Cyber Protection Team (CPT) network defenders must be able to
discover, detect, analyze, and mitigate threats and vulnerabilities to defend the DoD
information network.



Improve the effectiveness of the current DoD Computer Network Defense Service
Provider (CNDSP) construct in defending and protecting DoD networks. Computer
network defense service providers deliver cybersecurity solutions for DoD networks, to
include monitoring, detection, and protection capabilities. The Defense Department will
determine whether current CNDSP processes are sufficient to defend networks against
known and projected threats in cyberspace and whether current CNDSP forces are
adequately trained and equipped to defend against advanced threats. Finally, DoD will

20

The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy

determine whether its CNDSP forces can integrate into the broader cyberspace command
and control construct and how that integrated construct will perform in the face of cyber
threats that span CNDSP and CPT protected networks and data.




Plan for network defense and resilience. The Defense Department must identify and plan
to defend the networks that support key DoD missions. The Department must make a
careful assessment of the priority assets that it must defend in cyberspace to assure DoD
missions and exercise to defend those assets effectively.
o

Integrate cyber into mission assurance assessments. The Defense Department will
integrate cybersecurity requirements and assessments into the DoD Mission Assurance
program and update DoD policy appropriately. Currently DoD components take
varying approaches to measuring and
assessing cyber risks for mission
assurance. DoD will develop a Joint
Mission Assurance Assessment Program
that includes the integration of
cybersecurity assessments, cybersecurity
requirements, and cyber operations’
requirements.

o

Assess Cyber Protection Team (CPT)
capabilities. DoD will complete an
assessment of CPT capacity, capability,
and employment model in regard to
mission assurance priorities as set by
combatant command requirements.

the Army's Cyber Center of Excellence, Fort Gordon, GA. (Photo by
Michael L. Lewis)

o

Improve weapons systems cybersecurity. DoD will assess and initiate improvements to
the cybersecurity of current and future weapons systems, doing so on the basis of
operational requirements. For all future weapons systems that DoD will acquire or
procure, DoD will mandate specific cybersecurity standards for weapons systems to
meet. Acquisition and procurement policy and practice will be updated to promote
effective cybersecurity throughout a system’s life cycle.

o

Build and exercise continuity plans. All DoD components will identify and build
resiliency plans to maintain continuity of their most critical operations in the event of
network disruption and degradation. Military campaign plans must fully incorporate
the ability to operate in a degraded cyber environment; military forces must exercise and
be able to conduct military campaigns in a degraded cyber environment where access to
networks and data is uncertain. Components must balance cyber risks effectively to
ensure that they can continue to carry out their missions in the physical world.

Red team DoD’s network defenses. The Defense Department has developed mature red
team capabilities to test vital networks and mission systems for vulnerabilities and to better

21

The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy

prepare its cyber defense forces. Going forward, DoD must focus its red team capabilities on
priority networks and mission systems to assure DoD’s ability to carry out its most critical
missions. As a part of this work, every major DoD exercise should include a cyber red team
to test DoD's cyber defenses in a realistic scenario where the Department could have its
operations disrupted by an adversary. Components will be audited regularly to ensure
progress in incorporating red team findings and improving their cybersecurity posture.


Mitigate the risk of insider threats. The nation's defense depends upon the fidelity of those
entrusted with the nation's secrets. The Defense Department has invested in the
technological and personnel solutions necessary to identify threats before they can impact
U.S. national security. The Defense Department continues to deploy and implement these
solutions through continuous network monitoring, improved cybersecurity training for the
workforce, and improved methods for identifying‎, reporting, and tracking suspicious
behavior.
o



This work extends beyond information technology and includes matters of personnel
and reliability. Mitigating the insider threat requires good leadership and accountability
throughout the workforce. Beyond implementing policies and protocols, leaders will
strive to create a culture of awareness to anticipate, detect, and respond to insider
threats before they have an impact.

Exercise to provide Defense Support of Civil Authorities. Under its existing and planned
force structure, DoD will develop a framework and exercise its Defense Support of Civil
Authorities (DSCA) capabilities in support of DHS and other agencies and with state and
local authorities to help defend the federal government and the private sector in an
emergency if directed.
o

DoD‘s annual exercise program, to include Cyber Guard, will include exercising with
DHS and the FBI for contingencies that may require emergency allocation of forces to
help protect critical infrastructure, under
partner agencies’ lead. This framework will
describe how combatant commands and combat
support agencies can partner with DHS and FBI
and other agencies to improve integration,
training and support.


Define and refine the National Guard’s
role in supporting law enforcement,
Homeland Defense, and Defense Support of
Civil Authorities missions. DoD will work
with the National Guard to define the
coordinate, train, advise, and assist (C/TAA)
roles of the National Guard force and refine
implementation through Cyber Guard 16-1.
Under its existing and planned force structure,

22

The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy

National Guard forces will exercise to coordinate, train, advise, and assist state and local
agencies and domestic critical infrastructure and to provide support to law enforcement,
Homeland Defense, and Defense Support of Civil Authorities activities in support of
national objectives.


Improve accountability and responsibility for the protection of data across DoD and the
DIB. The Defense Department will ensure that policies and any associated federal rules or
contract language requirements have been implemented to require DIB companies to report
data theft and loss to the Defense Cyber Crime Center.
o

DoD will continue to assess Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement
(DFARS) rules and associated guidance to ensure they mature over time in a manner
consistent with known standards for protecting data from cyber adversaries, to include
standards promulgated by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

o

DoD will continue to expand companies' participation in threat information sharing
programs, such as the Cyber Security/Information Assurance program.

o

As the certification authority for DIB cleared defense contractor sites, the Defense
Security Service will expand education and training programs to include material for
DoD personnel and DIB contractors to enhance their cyber threat awareness.

o

In addition, the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence will review the
sufficiency of current classification guidance for critical acquisition and technology
programs to protect information on contractor networks.



Strengthen DoD’s procurement and acquisition cybersecurity standards. To defend DoD
networks, DoD must strengthen the cybersecurity requirements of DoD’s network
acquisition and procurement items by integrating cybersecurity standards into contract
vehicles for research, development, and procurement. DoD will specify additional
cybersecurity standards for industry to meet for components of any DoD procurement item.



Build collaboration between the acquisition, intelligence, counterintelligence, law
enforcement, and operations communities to prevent, mitigate, and respond to data loss.
DoD will establish a Joint Acquisition Protection and Exploitation Cell (JAPEC) to link
intelligence, counterintelligence, and law enforcement agents with acquisition program
managers to prevent and mitigate data loss and theft. DoD will conduct comprehensive risk
and damage assessments of cyber espionage and theft to inform requirements, acquisition,
programmatic, and counterintelligence courses of action.
o

The DoD CIO, in collaboration with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for
Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, will assess and update specific information
system security controls that underpin the DFARs for defense contractors within the
NIST and DFARS standards.

23

The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy



o

To safeguard critical programs and technologies DoD will work with companies to
develop alert capabilities and build layered cyber defenses.

o

Finally, the Defense Cyber Crime Center, the Principal Cyber Advisor to the Secretary of
Defense, and the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology,
and Logistics will collaborate with the Services' Damage Assessment Management
Offices to streamline risk and damage assessment processes to better inform decisions to
maintain, modify, or cancel penetrated programs.

Use DoD counterintelligence capabilities to defend against intrusions. The Military
Departments and the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, in consultation with the
Principal Cyber Advisor, will develop a strategy for the Secretary of Defense’s approval that
maximizes the capabilities and authorities of the military departments’ counterintelligence
agencies to identify, attribute, and defend against cyber intruders.
o



Counterintelligence authorities are uniquely positioned to improve our insight into and
frustrate and defeat cyber espionage. The strategy will specify how DoD’s
counterintelligence agencies will collaborate more effectively with the broader U.S.
intelligence and law enforcement communities on investigations and human and
technical operations to thwart cyber-enabled intellectual property theft against the
United States and its allies and partners.

Support whole-of-government policies and capabilities to counter intellectual property
theft. The Defense Department will continue to work with other agencies of the U.S.
government to counter the threat posed by intellectual property theft through cyberspace.

STRATEGIC GOAL III: BE PREPARED TO DEFEND THE U.S. HOMELAND AND U.S.
VITAL INTERESTS FROM DISRUPTIVE OR DESTRUCTIVE CYBERATTACKS OF
SIGNIFICANT CONSEQUENCE.


Continue to develop intelligence and warning capabilities to anticipate threats. To defend
the nation against cyberattacks of significant consequence, DoD will work with the broader
intelligence community to develop intelligence capabilities about adversary activities and
prepare to disrupt cyberattacks before they can impact the U.S. homeland and U.S. interests.
To meet combatant command contingency requirements, DoD will expand its intelligence of
key adversary human and technical networks. To operate effectively in cyberspace DoD
requires cyber intelligence and warning and shared situational awareness through all
phases of a potential operation. All intelligence collection will follow the law and guidance
outlined in executive orders.



Develop and exercise capabilities to defend the nation. The National Mission Force and
other relevant DoD components will train and partner with key interagency organizations

24

The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy

to prepare to conduct cyber operations to defend the nation from cyberattacks of significant
consequence. In addition, DoD will practice emergency procedures through regular
exercises at all levels of the Department and support interagency exercises to practice
emergency and deliberate cyber action procedures.
o

Build partnerships to defend the nation.
DoD will have a framework in place to
cooperate with other government
agencies to conduct defend the nation
operations. DoD will work with FBI, CIA,
DHS and other agencies to build
relationships and integrate capabilities to
provide the President with the widest
range of options available to respond to a
cyberattack of significant consequence to
the United States.

o

Conduct an annual comprehensive
review of DoD’s defend the nation

capabilities. The Defense Department’s program is a foundational cyber warfare program that is developing
requirements and capabilities for its platforms for the Defense Department. DARPA uses advanced touch-table
displays to use finger gestures and motions to advance the state of the art
mission to defend the nation against in cyber operations. (Photo courtesy of DARPA)
cyberattacks of significant consequence
will evolve over time. On an annual basis, DoD will conduct an in-depth review of the
capabilities available and required for the mission. As a part of this review, DoD will
validate new requirements and identify gaps and initiatives to pursue.



Develop innovative approaches to defending U.S. critical infrastructure. DoD will work
with DHS to improve the Enhanced Cybersecurity Services program and encourage
additional critical infrastructure entities to participate, with a particular emphasis on
increasing the number of defense critical infrastructure participants.



Develop automated information sharing tools. To improve shared situational awareness
DoD will partner with DHS and other agencies to develop continuous, automated,
standardized mechanisms for sharing information with each of its critical partners in the
U.S. government, key allied and partner militaries, state and local governments, and the
private sector. In addition, DoD will work with other U.S. government agencies and
Congress to support legislation that enables information sharing between the U.S.
government and the private sector.



Assess DoD’s cyber deterrence posture and strategy. Building off of the Defense Science
Board’s Task Force on Cyber Deterrence, U.S. Strategic Command (USSTRATCOM), in
coordination with the Joint Staff and the Office of the Secretary of Defense, will assess the
Department of Defense’s ability to deter specific state and non-state actors from conducting
cyberattacks of significant consequence on the U.S. homeland and against U.S. interests, to
25

The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy

include loss of life, significant destruction of property, or significant impact on U.S. foreign
and economic policy interests.
o

In conducting its analysis, USSTRATCOM must determine whether DoD is building the
capabilities required for attributing and deterring key threats from conducting such
attacks and recommend specific actions that DoD can take to improve its cyber
deterrence posture. Careful attention should be devoted also to deterring non-state
actors that may fall outside of traditional deterrence frameworks but which could pose a
considerable threat to U.S. interests.

STRATEGIC GOAL IV: BUILD

AND MAINTAIN VIABLE CYBER OPTIONS AND

PLAN TO USE THOSE OPTIONS TO CONTROL CONFLICT ESCALATION AND TO
SHAPE THE CONFLICT ENVIRONMENT AT ALL STAGES.


Integrate cyber options into plans. To meet strategic end-states as defined by the Guidance
for the Employment of the Force, combatant command plans, and other strategic guidance
documents, DoD will work with agencies of the U.S. government as well as U.S. allies and
partners to integrate cyber options into combatant command planning.
o

Accelerate the integration of cyber requirements into plans. The Defense Department
will accelerate the integration of cyber requirements into combatant command plans.
Plans must outline and define specific cyberspace effects against targets. To facilitate this
work, the Joint Staff will work with USSTRATCOM to synchronize and integrate
requirements into planning and provide recommendations to the Chairman of the Joint
Chiefs of Staff on the alignment, allocation, assignment, and apportionment of Cyber
Mission Forces.

STRATEGIC GOAL V: BUILD

AND MAINTAIN

ROBUST INTERNATIONAL

ALLIANCES AND PARTNERSHIPS TO DETER SHARED THREATS AND INCREASE
INTERNATIONAL SECURITY AND STABILITY.


Build partner capacity in key regions. Under its existing and planned force structure, DoD
will work with key allies and partners to build partner capacity and help secure the critical
infrastructure and key resources on which DoD missions and U.S. interests depend. The
Defense Department will work regularly with other agencies of the U.S. government, to
include the Department of State, in building partner capacity. Priority regions include the
Middle East, Asia-Pacific, and Europe.
o

Support the hardening and resiliency of Middle Eastern allies’ and partners’ networks
and systems. As a part of its cyber dialogue and partnerships, DoD will work with key
Middle Eastern allies and partners to improve their ability to secure their military
networks as well as the critical infrastructure and key resources upon which U.S.
interests depend. Key initiatives include improved information sharing to establish a
26

The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy

unified understanding of the cyber threat, an assessment of our mutual cyber defense
posture, and collaborative approaches to building cyber expertise.
o

Support the hardening and resiliency of
Northeast Asian allies’ networks and
systems. As a part of its broader cyber
dialogue with Asian allies, DoD will work
with key allies and partners to improve
their ability to secure their military

The Defense Department will develop these partnerships through the defense
consultations that DoD holds with its key NATO allies.

o

DoD will remain flexible and agile as it builds alliances and partnerships to best respond
to shifts in the strategic environment.



Develop solutions to counter the proliferation of destructive malware. State and non-state
actors seek to acquire destructive malware. The uncontrolled spread of destructive malware
to hostile actors presents a significant risk to the international system. Working with the
Department of State and other agencies of the U.S. government as well as U.S. allies and
partners, the Defense Department will draw on best-practices to counter the proliferation of
destructive malware within the international system. In addition to international regimes
and best-practices, the U.S. government has a range of domestic export control regimes for
governing dual-use technologies that can be used to prevent proliferation.



Work with capable international partners to plan and train for cyber operations.
Throughout the course of this strategy, DoD will strengthen its international alliances and
partnerships to develop combined capabilities to achieve cyber effects in support of
combatant command plans.

27

The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy



Strengthen the United States cyber dialogue with China to enhance strategic stability.
Through the course of this strategy, as part of the U.S.-China Defense Consultative Talks
and related dialogues, such as the Cyber Working Group, DoD will continue to hold
discussions with China to bring greater understanding and transparency of each nation’s
military doctrine, policy, roles and missions in cyberspace. The goal of this work is to reduce
the risks of misperception and miscalculation that could contribute to escalation and
instability. DoD will support U.S. government efforts to strengthen confidence-building
measures to bring a greater level of trust to the U.S.-China relationship. In addition, DoD
will continue to raise concerns about China’s cyber enabled theft of U.S. intellectual
property, trade secrets, and confidential business information.1

If and when U.S.-Russia military relations resume, as a part of broader interagency efforts DoD will seek
to develop a military-to-military cyber dialogue with Russia to foster strategic stability in cyberspace.

V. MANAGING THE STRATEGY

To achieve the goals and objectives outlined in this strategy will require hard choices regarding
cyber forces and personnel, organizations, and capabilities. The financial choices that DoD
makes in the course of implementing this strategy will have national and global implications for
years to come, and DoD must operate in an effective and cost-efficient manner to guarantee the
best return on its investments. To that end, DoD will pursue the following management
objectives to govern its cyber activities and missions.


Establish the Office of the Principal Cyber Advisor to the Secretary of Defense. In the
National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) of 2014, Congress required the Defense
Department to designate a Principal Cyber Advisor to the Secretary of Defense to review
military cyberspace activities, cyber mission forces, and offensive and defensive cyber
operations and missions. In addition, the Principal Cyber Advisor will govern the
development of DoD cyberspace policy and strategy for the DoD enterprise.
o

The 2014 NDAA also stipulated that this Principal Cyber Advisor integrate the cyber
expertise and perspectives of key organizations to build an intradepartmental team of
key players to ensure effective governance of cyber issues within DoD. The Principal
Cyber Advisor responsibilities assigned by the FY14 NDAA shall not be interpreted to
affect the existing responsibilities and authorities of the Under Secretary of Defense for
Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics; the Under Secretary of Defense for Policy; the
Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence; the Under Secretary of Defense for
Personnel and Readiness; or any other Principal Staff Assistant (PSA) in the office of the
Secretary of Defense in cyber-related responsibilities and authorities.

o

An intradepartmental team. The Principal Cyber Advisor will work with DoD
components through the Cyber Investment and Management Board (CIMB) to review
DoD’s cyber management. The CIMB will be a forum for synchronization, coordination,
and project management. It will not replicate existing programmatic and budgetary
mechanisms or interfere with previously defined Principal Staff Assistant roles and
authorities, nor will it interfere in any way with the military chain of command; rather, it
will provide a single forum to integrate cyber initiatives, it will manage projects through
29

The Department of Defense Cyber Strategy

completion, and streamline DoD’s cyber governance structures. The PCA will work
with the Office of the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and
Logistics and the Joint Staff to build an intradepartmental team of DoD representatives
to support the CIMB in this work.

A senior executive forum. Subordinate and reporting to the CIMB, a senior executive
forum will provide initial senior-level coordination on key cyber issues. The senior
executive forum will recommend courses of action to the CIMB and will coordinate with
other OSD and Joint Staff governance bodies to facilitate unity of effort and resolve
management issues at appropriate levels.

o

If and when a budgetary or financial matter comes into play during the Program and
Budget Review process, the Principal Cyber Advisor will use the senior executive forum
and the CIMB to coordinate recommendations for the Deputy’s Management Action
Group or other financial and budgetary organizations, vetting options and alternatives
through the issue teams as appropriate.

Improve cyber budgetary management. DoD will develop an agreed-upon method to more
transparently and effectively manage the DoD cyber operations budget. Today cyber
funding is spread across the DoD budget, to include the Military Intelligence Program
(MIP), in multiple appropriations, budget lines, program elements, and projects. In addition,
the Under Secretary of Defense for Intelligence, on behalf of DoD, ensures that all National
Intelligence Program (NIP) investments are aligned to support DoD missions. The diffuse
nature of the DoD cyber budget presents DoD with a challenge for effective budgetary
management; DoD must develop a new method for
managing cross-program funding to improve
mission effectiveness and achieve management
efficiencies.

Sailors conduct an exercise at Fleet Cyber Command's headquarters in
the Frank B. Rowlett Building, Fort George G. Meade, MD. This
exercise features members of Fleet Cyber Command's Joint Force
Headquarters-Cyber (JFHQ-C).



 Develop DoD’s cyber operations and
cybersecurity policy framework. Consistent with
Presidential guidance, DoD will align and simplify
its cyber operations and cybersecurity policy
management and identified gaps, overlaps, seams,
conflicts, and areas in need of revision in current
documentation. This effort will help translate
national and departmental guidance and policy into
tactical operations. It is essential to clarifying
conflicts in existing documentation that currently
complicate cyber operations and cybersecurity
governance.

Conduct an end-to-end assessment of DoD’s cyber capabilities. U.S. Cyber Command
will lead a comprehensive operational assessment of its posture. In coordination with
the Principal Cyber Advisor to the Secretary of Defense, the Office of the Under
Secretary of Defense for Acquisition, Technology, and Logistics, and the Office of the
Director of Coast Assessment and Program Evaluation, USCYBERCOM will provide
short- and long-term recommendations through the CIMB to provide to the Secretary of

Defense regarding organizational structure, command and control mechanism, rules of
engagement, personnel, capabilities, tools, and potential operational gaps. The goal of
this posture assessment will be to provide a clear understanding of the future
operational environment; key stakeholder views; as well as strategic priorities, choices,
and resources for planning and operations.

CONCLUSION

We live in a time of growing cyber threats to U.S. interests. State and non-state actors threaten
disruptive and destructive attacks against the United States and conduct cyber-enabled theft of
intellectual property to undercut the United States’ technological and military advantage. We
are vulnerable in cyberspace, and the scale of the cyber threat requires urgent action by leaders
and organizations across the government and the private sector.
Since developing its first cyber strategy in 2011, the Defense Department has made significant
progress in building its cyber capabilities, developing its organizations and plans, and fostering
the partnerships necessary to defend the country and its interests. More must be done.
Stemming from the goals and objectives outlined in this strategy, appropriate resources must be
aligned and managed to ensure progress.
This strategy presents an aggressive, specific plan for achieving change. For DoD to succeed in
its mission of defending the United States and its interests in cyberspace, leaders from across
the Department must take action to achieve the objectives outlined in this document. They must
also hold their organizations accountable. Because of the nature of networks and computer
code, no single organization can be relied upon to do this work. Success requires close
collaboration across DoD, between agencies of the U.S. government, with the private sector, and
with U.S. allies and partners.
The strategic environment can change quickly. That is especially true in cyberspace. We must be
dynamic, flexible, and agile in this work. We must anticipate emerging threats, identify new
capabilities to build, and determine how to enhance our partnerships and planning. As always,
our women and men – both uniformed and civilian personnel – will be our greatest and most
enduring strength and a constant source of inspiration. By working together we will help
protect and defend the United States and its interests in the digital age.
