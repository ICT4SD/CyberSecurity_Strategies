Background
The alarming rise of premeditated attacks with
potentially catastrophic effects to interdependent
networks and information systems across the globe has
demanded that significant attention is paid to critical
information infrastructure protection initiatives.
For many years Governments have been
protecting strategically critical
infrastructures, however in recent times
the information revolution has
transformed all areas of life. The way
business is transacted, government
operates, and national defence is
conducted has changed. These activities
now rely on an interdependent network
of information technology
infrastructures and this increases our
risk to a wide range of new
vulnerabilities and threats to the
nation’s critical infrastructures. These
new cyber threats are in many ways
significantly different from the more
traditional risks that Governments have
been used to addressing. Exploiting
security flaws appears now to be far
easier, less expensive and more
anonymous than ever before.

The increasing pervasiveness,
connectivity and globalization of
information technology coupled with
the rapidly changing, dynamic nature of
cyber threats and our commitment to
the use of ICT for socio-economic
development brings about the critical
need to protect the critical information
infrastructures to provide greater
control. This means that Governments,
including the Malaysian government,
must adopt an integrated approach to
protect these infrastructures from
cyber threats.

The National Cyber Security Policy
This National Cyber Security Policy has been designed to facilitate
Malaysia’s move towards a knowledge-based economy (K-economy). The
Policy was formulated based on a National Cyber Security Framework that
comprises legislation and regulatory, technology, public-private
cooperation, institutional, and international aspects.

The National Cyber Security Policy seeks to address the risks to the Critical National
Information Infrastructure (CNII) which comprises the networked information systems of
ten critical sectors. The CNII sectors are:
National Defence and Security
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•
•

Banking and Finance
Information and Communications
Energy
Transportation
Water
Health Services
Government
Emergency services
Food and Agriculture

The Policy recognizes the critical and highly interdependent nature of the CNII and aims to
develop and establish a comprehensive programme and a series of frameworks that will
ensure the effectiveness of cyber security controls over vital assets. It has been developed
to ensure that the CNII are protected to a level that commensurate the risks faced.

The successful implementation of the eight policy thrust as contained within the
National Cyber Security relies on a coordinated and focused approach. The key
feature of the Policy implementation is:
Establishment Of The Malaysia Cyber Security Centre
The Malaysia Cyber Security Centre is envisioned to become a one-stop coordination centre for national cyber security
initiatives by adopting a coordinated and focused approach, with the key objective of strengthening the country’s cyber
security arena.
The centre will be under the purview of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation (MOSTI), and overseen by the
National IT Council for policy direction and the National Security Council in times of national crisis.

The key functions of the Malaysia Cyber Security Center are :
•

National Cyber Security Policy Implementation
Defines, communicates and updates (when necessary) the national cyber security programmes to all the CNII.

•

National Coordination
Closely coordinates cyber security initiatives of various key Agencies and organisations in Malaysia.

•

Outreach
Promote and facilities formal and informal mechanism for information sharing across the CNII. This includes
promoting cyber security awareness, training and education programmes to grow the competency of
information security professionals and the industry as a whole.

•

Compliance Monitoring
Facilities the monitoring of compliance to cyber security policies and standards across the CNII.

•

Risk Assessment
Assesses and identifies cyber security threats exploiting vulnerabilities and risks across the CNII.

Conclusion
Today’s unrelenting march towards an IT centric infrastructure with
increasingly complex interdependencies, increasingly frequent
cyber attacks and dynamic risk profile has required governments to
review traditional protection mechanisms. 21st century
infrastructure protection programmes will need to consider a host
of virtual as well as physical threats.
Key to the success of any protection programme is effective governance and coordination. The National
Cyber Security Policy focuses particular attention upon this area. The establishment of a single
coordinating body will help tp provide additional levels of organization, clarity and accountability. It will
enhance the operations of current organisations who will continue to perform their duties and enhance
the security of the CNII.
Alongside clear and effective governance, the National Cyber Security Policy provides mechanisms for
improving the trust and cooperation between the public and private sectors, improving cyber security
skills and capacity, and focuses on enhancing existing skills and capacity, and focuses on enhancing
research and development initiatives and practices with the aim towards self-reliance. It also maps out
emergency readiness initiatives and dictates a programme of compliance and assurance across the whole
of the CNII
The National Cyber Security Policy also reaches out to Malaysia’s international partners and describes
methods whereby Malaysia can share cyber security knowledge with the region and the wider world. It
propels Malaysia towards greater international recognition in this field.
Taken as a whole, the National Cyber Security Policy aims to improve trust and cooperation in the CNII
both at home and abroad, for the benefit of the people of Malaysia.
