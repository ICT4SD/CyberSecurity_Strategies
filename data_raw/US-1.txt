THE WHITE HOUSE
WASHINGTON
My Fellow Americans:
The way business is transacted, government operates, and national defense is
conducted have changed. These activities now rely on an interdependent network
of information technology infrastructures called cyberspace. The National Strategy
to Secure Cyberspace provides a framework for protecting this infrastructure that is
essential to our economy, security, and way of life.
In the past few years, threats in cyberspace have risen dramatically. The policy of
the United States is to protect against the debilitating disruption of the operation
of information systems for critical infrastructures and, thereby, help to protect the
people, economy, and national security of the United States. We must act to reduce
our vulnerabilities to these threats before they can be exploited to damage the
cyber systems supporting our Nation’s critical infrastructures and ensure that such
disruptions of cyberspace are infrequent, of minimal duration, manageable, and
cause the least damage possible.
Securing cyberspace is an extraordinarily difficult strategic challenge that requires a
coordinated and focused effort from our entire society—the federal government,
state and local governments, the private sector, and the American people. To
engage Americans in securing cyberspace, a draft version of this strategy was
released for public comment, and ten town hall meetings were held around the
Nation to gather input on the development of a national strategy. Thousands of
people and numerous organizations participated in these town hall meetings and
responded with comments. I thank them all for their continuing participation.
The cornerstone of America’s cyberspace security strategy is and will remain a
public-private partnership. The federal government invites the creation of, and
participation in, public-private partnerships to implement this strategy. Only by
acting together can we build a more secure future in cyberspace.

Executive Summary
Our Nation’s critical infrastructures are
composed of public and private institutions in
the sectors of agriculture, food, water, public
health, emergency services, government, defense
industrial base, information and telecommunications, energy, transportation, banking and
finance, chemicals and hazardous materials, and
postal and shipping. Cyberspace is their nervous
system—the control system of our country.
Cyberspace is composed of hundreds of
thousands of interconnected computers, servers,
routers, switches, and fiber optic cables that
allow our critical infrastructures to work. Thus,
the healthy functioning of cyberspace is
essential to our economy and our national
security.

This National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace is
part of our overall effort to protect the Nation.
It is an implementing component of the
National Strategy for Homeland Security and is
complemented by a National Strategy for the
Physical Protection of Critical Infrastructures and
Key Assets. The purpose of this document is to
engage and empower Americans to secure the
portions of cyberspace that they own, operate,
control, or with which they interact. Securing
cyberspace is a difficult strategic challenge that
requires coordinated and focused effort from
our entire society—the federal government,
state and local governments, the private sector,
and the American people.

The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace
outlines an initial framework for both organizing and prioritizing efforts. It provides
direction to the federal government departments and agencies that have roles in
cyberspace security. It also identifies steps that
state and local governments, private companies
and organizations, and individual Americans
can take to improve our collective cybersecurity.
The Strategy highlights the role of publicprivate engagement. The document provides a
framework for the contributions that we all can
make to secure our parts of cyberspace. The
dynamics of cyberspace will require adjustments
and amendments to the Strategy over time.
The speed and anonymity of cyber attacks
makes distinguishing among the actions of
terrorists, criminals, and nation states difficult, a
task which often occurs only after the fact, if at
all. Therefore, the National Strategy to Secure
Cyberspace helps reduce our Nation’s vulnerability to debilitating attacks against our critical
information infrastructures or the physical
assets that support them.

Strategic Objectives
Consistent with the National Strategy for
Homeland Security, the strategic objectives
of this National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace
are to:
• Prevent cyber attacks against America’s
critical infrastructures;
• Reduce national vulnerability to cyber
attacks; and
• Minimize damage and recovery time from
cyber attacks that do occur.

Threat and Vulnerability
Our economy and national security are fully
dependent upon information technology and
the information infrastructure. At the core of
the information infrastructure upon which we
depend is the Internet, a system originally

S U M M A R Y

designed to share unclassified research among
scientists who were assumed to be uninterested
in abusing the network. It is that same Internet
that today connects millions of other computer
networks making most of the nation’s essential
services and infrastructures work. These
computer networks also control physical objects
such as electrical transformers, trains, pipeline
pumps, chemical vats, radars, and stock
markets, all of which exist beyond cyberspace.
A spectrum of malicious actors can and do
conduct attacks against our critical information
infrastructures. Of primary concern is the threat
of organized cyber attacks capable of causing
debilitating disruption to our Nation’s critical
infrastructures, economy, or national security.
The required technical sophistication to carry
out such an attack is high—and partially
explains the lack of a debilitating attack to date.
We should not, however, be too sanguine. There
have been instances where organized attackers
have exploited vulnerabilities that may be
indicative of more destructive capabilities.
Uncertainties exist as to the intent and full
technical capabilities of several observed
attacks. Enhanced cyber threat analysis is
needed to address long-term trends related to
threats and vulnerabilities. What is known is
that the attack tools and methodologies are
becoming widely available, and the technical
capability and sophistication of users bent on
causing havoc or disruption is improving.
In peacetime America’s enemies may conduct
espionage on our Government, university
research centers, and private companies. They
may also seek to prepare for cyber strikes during
a confrontation by mapping U.S. information
systems, identifying key targets, and lacing our
infrastructure with back doors and other means
of access. In wartime or crisis, adversaries may
seek to intimidate the Nation’s political leaders
by attacking critical infrastructures and key
economic functions or eroding public confidence in information systems.

E X E C U T I V E

Cyber attacks on United States information
networks can have serious consequences such as
disrupting critical operations, causing loss of
revenue and intellectual property, or loss of life.
Countering such attacks requires the development of robust capabilities where they do not
exist today if we are to reduce vulnerabilities
and deter those with the capabilities and intent
to harm our critical infrastructures.

The Government Role in Securing
Cyberspace
In general, the private sector is best equipped
and structured to respond to an evolving cyber
threat. There are specific instances, however,
where federal government response is most
appropriate and justified. Looking inward,
providing continuity of government requires
ensuring the safety of its own cyber infrastructure and those assets required for
supporting its essential missions and services.
Externally, a government role in cybersecurity is
warranted in cases where high transaction costs
or legal barriers lead to significant coordination
problems; cases in which governments operate
in the absence of private sector forces;
resolution of incentive problems that lead to
under provisioning of critical shared resources;
and raising awareness.
Public-private engagement is a key component
of our Strategy to secure cyberspace. This is
true for several reasons. Public-private partnerships can usefully confront coordination
problems. They can significantly enhance
information exchange and cooperation.
Public-private engagement will take a variety
of forms and will address awareness, training,
technological improvements, vulnerability
remediation, and recovery operations.
A federal role in these and other cases is only
justified when the benefits of intervention
outweigh the associated costs. This standard is
especially important in cases where there are
viable private sector solutions for addressing any
potential threat or vulnerability. For each case,

S U M M A R Y

consideration should be given to the broadbased costs and impacts of a given government
action, versus other alternative actions, versus
non-action, taking into account any existing or
future private solutions.
Federal actions to secure cyberspace are
warranted for purposes including: forensics and
attack attribution, protection of networks and
systems critical to national security, indications
and warnings, and protection against organized
attacks capable of inflicting debilitating damage
to the economy. Federal activities should also
support research and technology development
that will enable the private sector to better
secure privately-owned portions of the Nation’s
critical infrastructure.

Department of Homeland Security and
Cyberspace Security
On November 25, 2002, President Bush signed
legislation creating the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS). This new cabinetlevel department will unite 22 federal entities
for the common purpose of improving our
homeland security. The Secretary of DHS will
have important responsibilities in cyberspace
security. These responsibilities include:
• Developing a comprehensive national plan
for securing the key resources and critical
infrastructure of the United States;
• Providing crisis management in response
to attacks on critical information systems;
• Providing technical assistance to the
private sector and other government
entities with respect to emergency
recovery plans for failures of critical information systems;
• Coordinating with other agencies of the
federal government to provide specific
warning information and advice about
appropriate protective measures and
countermeasures to state, local, and
nongovernmental organizations including

T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E ix

E X E C U T I V E

the private sector, academia, and the
public; and
• Performing and funding research and
development along with other agencies
that will lead to new scientific understanding and technologies in support of
homeland security.
Consistent with these responsibilities, DHS will
become a federal center of excellence for cybersecurity and provide a focal point for federal
outreach to state, local, and nongovernmental
organizations including the private sector,
academia, and the public.

Critical Priorities for Cyberspace
Security
The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace
articulates five national priorities including:
I. A National Cyberspace Security
Response System;
II. A National Cyberspace Security Threat
and Vulnerability Reduction Program;
III. A National Cyberspace Security
Awareness and Training Program;
IV. Securing Governments’ Cyberspace; and
V. National Security and International
Cyberspace Security Cooperation.
The first priority focuses on improving our
response to cyber incidents and reducing the
potential damage from such events. The second,
third, and fourth priorities aim to reduce threats
from, and our vulnerabilities to, cyber attacks.
The fifth priority is to prevent cyber attacks
that could impact national security assets and to
improve the international management of and
response to such attacks.

S U M M A R Y

Priority I: A National Cyberspace
Security Response System
Rapid identification, information exchange, and
remediation can often mitigate the damage
caused by malicious cyberspace activity. For
those activities to be effective at a national level,
the United States needs a partnership between
government and industry to perform analyses,
issue warnings, and coordinate response efforts.
Privacy and civil liberties must be protected in
the process. Because no cybersecurity plan can
be impervious to concerted and intelligent
attack, information systems must be able to
operate while under attack and have the
resilience to restore full operations quickly.
The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace
identifies eight major actions and initiatives for
cyberspace security response:
1. Establish a public-private architecture for
responding to national-level cyber
incidents;
2. Provide for the development of tactical
and strategic analysis of cyber attacks and
vulnerability assessments;
3. Encourage the development of a private
sector capability to share a synoptic view
of the health of cyberspace;
4. Expand the Cyber Warning and
Information Network to support the role
of DHS in coordinating crisis
management for cyberspace security;
5. Improve national incident management;
6. Coordinate processes for voluntary
participation in the development of
national public-private continuity and
contingency plans;
7. Exercise cybersecurity continuity plans
for federal systems; and
8. Improve and enhance public-private
information sharing involving cyber
attacks, threats, and vulnerabilities.

1. Enhance law enforcement’s capabilities
for preventing and prosecuting cyberspace attacks;
2. Create a process for national vulnerability
assessments to better understand the
potential consequences of threats and
vulnerabilities;
3. Secure the mechanisms of the Internet by
improving protocols and routing;
4. Foster the use of trusted digital control
systems/supervisory control and data
acquisition systems;
5. Reduce and remediate software vulnerabilities;
6. Understand infrastructure interdependencies and improve the physical security
of cyber systems and telecommunications;
7. Prioritize federal cybersecurity research
and development agendas; and
8. Assess and secure emerging systems.

Priority III: A National Cyberspace
Security Awareness and Training
Program

Priority II: A National Cyberspace
Security Threat and Vulnerability
Reduction Program
By exploiting vulnerabilities in our cyber
systems, an organized attack may endanger the
security of our Nation’s critical infrastructures.
The vulnerabilities that most threaten cyberspace occur in the information assets of critical
infrastructure enterprises themselves and their
external supporting structures, such as the
mechanisms of the Internet. Lesser-secured
sites on the interconnected network of networks
also present potentially significant exposures to
cyber attacks. Vulnerabilities result from
weaknesses in technology and because of
improper implementation and oversight of
technological products.

Many cyber vulnerabilities exist because of a
lack of cybersecurity awareness on the part of
computer users, systems administrators,
technology developers, procurement officials,
auditors, chief information officers (CIOs),
chief executive officers, and corporate boards.
Such awareness-based vulnerabilities present
serious risks to critical infrastructures regardless
of whether they exist within the infrastructure
itself. A lack of trained personnel and the
absence of widely accepted, multi-level
certification programs for cybersecurity
professionals complicate the task of addressing
cyber vulnerabilities.

The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace
identifies eight major actions and initiatives to
reduce threats and related vulnerabilities:

T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E xi

E X E C U T I V E

The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace
identifies four major actions and initiatives for
awareness, education, and training:
1. Promote a comprehensive national
awareness program to empower all
Americans—businesses, the general
workforce, and the general population—
to secure their own parts of cyberspace;
2. Foster adequate training and education
programs to support the Nation’s cybersecurity needs;
3. Increase the efficiency of existing federal
cybersecurity training programs; and
4. Promote private-sector support for
well-coordinated, widely recognized
professional cybersecurity certifications.

Priority IV: Securing Governments’
Cyberspace
Although governments administer only a
minority of the Nation’s critical infrastructure
computer systems, governments at all levels
perform essential services in the agriculture,
food, water, public health, emergency services,
defense, social welfare, information and
telecommunications, energy, transportation,
banking and finance, chemicals, and postal and
shipping sectors that depend upon cyberspace
for their delivery. Governments can lead by
example in cyberspace security, including
fostering a marketplace for more secure
technologies through their procurement.
The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace
identifies five major actions and initiatives for
the securing of governments’ cyberspace:
1. Continuously assess threats and vulnerabilities to federal cyber systems;
2. Authenticate and maintain authorized
users of federal cyber systems;
3. Secure federal wireless local area
networks;

S U M M A R Y

4. Improve security in government
outsourcing and procurement; and
5. Encourage state and local governments to
consider establishing information
technology security programs and participate in information sharing and analysis
centers with similar governments.

Priority V: National Security and
International Cyberspace Security
Cooperation
America’s cyberspace links the United States to
the rest of the world. A network of networks
spans the planet, allowing malicious actors on
one continent to act on systems thousands of
miles away. Cyber attacks cross borders at light
speed, and discerning the source of malicious
activity is difficult. America must be capable of
safeguarding and defending its critical systems
and networks. Enabling our ability to do so
requires a system of international cooperation to
facilitate information sharing, reduce vulnerabilities, and deter malicious actors.
The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace
identifies six major actions and initiatives to
strengthen U.S. national security and international cooperation:
1. Strengthen cyber-related counterintelligence efforts;
2. Improve capabilities for attack attribution
and response;
3. Improve coordination for responding to
cyber attacks within the U.S. national
security community;
4. Work with industry and through international organizations to facilitate dialogue
and partnerships among international
public and private sectors focused on
protecting information infrastructures
and promoting a global “culture of
security;”

xii T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E

E X E C U T I V E

S U M M A R Y

5. Foster the establishment of national and
international watch-and-warning
networks to detect and prevent cyber
attacks as they emerge; and

this Strategy. Inputs from the critical sector’s
themselves can be found at
http://www.pcis.org. (These documents
were not subject to government approval.)

6. Encourage other nations to accede to the
Council of Europe Convention on
Cybercrime, or to ensure that their laws
and procedures are at least as comprehensive.

These comprehensive infrastructure plans
describe the strategic initiatives of various
sectors, including:
• Banking and Finance;

A National Effort

• Insurance;

Protecting the widely distributed assets of
cyberspace requires the efforts of many
Americans. The federal government alone
cannot sufficiently defend America’s cyberspace.
Our traditions of federalism and limited
government require that organizations outside
the federal government take the lead in many of
these efforts. Every American who can
contribute to securing part of cyberspace is
encouraged to do so. The federal government
invites the creation of, and participation in,
public-private partnerships to raise cybersecurity awareness, train personnel, stimulate
market forces, improve technology, identify and
remediate vulnerabilities, exchange information,
and plan recovery operations.

• Chemical;

People and organizations across the United
States have already taken steps to improve
cyberspace security. On September 18, 2002,
many private-sector entities released plans and
strategies for securing their respective infrastructures. The Partnership for Critical
Infrastructure Security has played a unique role
in facilitating private-sector contributions to

• Oil and Gas;
• Electric;
• Law Enforcement;
• Higher Education;
• Transportation (Rail);
• Information Technology and
Telecommunications; and
• Water.
As each of the critical infrastructure sectors
implements these initiatives, threats and vulnerabilities to our infrastructures will be reduced.
For the foreseeable future two things will be
true: America will rely upon cyberspace and the
federal government will seek a continuing broad
partnership with the private sector to develop,
implement, and refine a National Strategy to
Secure Cyberspace.

Introduction
A Nation in Cyberspace
Our Nation’s critical infrastructures consist of
the physical and cyber assets of public and
private institutions in several sectors:
agriculture, food, water, public health,
emergency services, government, defense industrial base, information and telecommunications,
energy, transportation, banking and finance,
chemicals and hazardous materials, and postal
and shipping. Cyberspace is the nervous system
of these infrastructures—the control system of
our country. Cyberspace comprises hundreds of
thousands of interconnected computers, servers,
routers, switches, and fiber optic cables that
make our critical infrastructures work. Thus, the
healthy functioning of cyberspace is essential to

our economy and our national security.
Unfortunately, recent events have highlighted
the existence of cyberspace vulnerabilities and
the fact that malicious actors seek to exploit
them. (See, Cyberspace Threats and
Vulnerabilities.)
This National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace is
part of an overall effort to protect the Nation. It
is an implementing component of the National
Strategy for Homeland Security and is complemented by the National Strategy for the Physical
Protection of Critical Infrastructures and Key
Assets. The purpose of this document is to
engage and empower Americans to secure the
portions of cyberspace that they own, operate,
or control, or with which they interact. Securing

T H E N AT I O N A L S T R AT E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S PA C E 1

I N T R O D U C T I O N

cyberspace is a difficult strategic challenge that
requires coordinated and focused effort from
our entire society—the federal government,
state and local governments, the private sector,
and the American people.

A Unique Problem, a Unique Process
Most critical infrastructures, and the cyberspace
on which they rely, are privately owned and
operated. The technologies that create and
support cyberspace evolve rapidly from privatesector and academic innovation. Government
alone cannot sufficiently secure cyberspace.
Thus, President Bush has called for voluntary
partnerships among government, industry,
academia, and nongovernmental groups to
secure and defend cyberspace. (See, National
Policy and Guiding Principles.)
In recognition of this need for partnership, the
process to develop the National Strategy to
Secure Cyberspace included soliciting views from
both the public and private sectors. To do so,
the White House sponsored town hall meetings
on cyberspace security in ten metropolitan
areas. Consequently, individual sectors (e.g.,
higher education, state and local government,
banking and finance) formed workgroups to
create initial sector-specific cyberspace security
strategies. Additionally, the White House
created a Presidential advisory panel, the
National Infrastructure Advisory Council,
consisting of leaders from the key sectors of the
economy, government, and academia. The
President’s National Security
Telecommunications Advisory Committee
reviewed and commented on the Strategy.
In September 2002, the President’s Critical
Infrastructure Protection Board sought
comments from individuals and institutions
nationwide by placing a draft version of the
Strategy online for review. Thousands participated in the town hall meetings and provided
comments online. Their comments contributed
to shaping the Strategy by narrowing its focus
and sharpening its priorities.

This process recognizes that we can only secure
cyberspace successfully through an inclusive
national effort that engages major institutions
throughout the country. The federal
government designed the Strategy development
process to raise the Nation’s level of awareness
of the importance of cybersecurity. Its intent
was to produce a Strategy that many Americans
could feel they had a direct role in developing,
and to which they would be committed.
Although the redrafting process reflects many
of the comments provided, not everyone will
agree with each component of the National
Strategy to Secure Cyberspace. Many issues could
not be addressed in detail, and others are not
yet ripe for national policy. The Strategy is not
immutable; actions will evolve as technologies
advance, as threats and vulnerabilities change,
and as our understanding of the cybersecurity
issues improves and clarifies. A national
dialogue on cyberspace security must therefore
continue.
In the weeks following the release of the draft
Strategy, Congress approved the creation of the
Department of Homeland Security (DHS),
assigned to it many agencies that are active in
cybersecurity, and directed it to perform new
cybersecurity missions. This Strategy reflects
those changes. Congress passed and the
President signed the Cyber Security Research and
Development Act (Public Law 107-305), authorizing a multi-year effort to create more secure
cyber technologies, to expand cybersecurity
research and development, and to improve the
cybersecurity workforce.

Five National Cyberspace Security
Priorities
The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace is a
call for national awareness and action by
individuals and institutions throughout the
United States, to increase the level of cybersecurity nationwide and to implement continuous
processes for identifying and remedying cyber
vulnerabilities. Its framework is an agenda of

2 T H E N AT I O N A L S T R AT E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S PA C E

I N T R O D U C T I O N

five broad priorities that require widespread
voluntary participation. Each individual
program consists of several components, many
of which were drawn from the draft Strategy’s
recommendations and related public comments.
Addressing these priorities requires the
leadership of DHS as well as several other key
federal departments and agencies. As part of
the Office of Management and Budget
(OMB)-led budget process, and with the
support of Congress, these departments and
agencies now have the task of translating the
Strategy’s recommendations into actions.
Corporations, universities, state and local
governments, and other partners are also
encouraged to take actions consistent with these
five national cyberspace security priorities, both
independently and in partnership with the
federal government. Each private-sector organization must make its own decisions based on
cost effectiveness analysis and risk-management
and mitigation strategies.
The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace articulates five national priorities. The first priority
focuses on improving our ability to respond to
cyber incidents and reduce the potential
damage from such events. The second, third,
and fourth priorities aim to reduce the numbers
of cyber threats and our overall vulnerability to
cyber attacks. The fifth priority focuses on
preventing cyber attacks with the potential to
impact national security assets and improving
international management of and response to
such attacks.

Priority I: A National Cyberspace
Security Response System
Rapid identification, information exchange, and
remediation can often mitigate the damage
caused by malicious cyberspace activity. For
those activities to take place effectively at a
national level, the United States requires a
partnership between government and industry
to perform analyses, issue warnings, and

coordinate response efforts. Privacy and civil
liberties must be protected in the process.
Because no cybersecurity plan can be impervious to concerted and intelligent attacks,
information systems must be able to operate
while under attack and also have the resilience
to restore full operations in their wake. To
prepare for the possibility of major cyber
attacks, America needs a national cyber disaster
recovery plan. The National Cyberspace
Security Response System will involve public
and private institutions and cyber centers to
perform analysis, conduct watch and warning
activities, enable information exchange, and
facilitate restoration efforts.

Priority II: A National Cyberspace
Security Threat and Vulnerability
Reduction Program
By exploiting vulnerabilities in our cyber
systems, an organized cyber attack may
endanger the security of our Nation’s critical
infrastructures. Cyberspace vulnerabilities occur
in the critical infrastructure enterprises and
government departments themselves, in their
external supporting structures (such as the
mechanisms of the Internet), and in unsecured
sites across the interconnected network of
networks. Vulnerabilities exist for several
reasons including technological weaknesses,
poor security-control implementation, and
absences of effective oversight.
A National Cyberspace Security Threat and
Vulnerability reduction program will include
coordinated national efforts conducted by
governments and the private sector to identify
and remediate the most serious cyber vulnerabilities through collaborative activities, such as
sharing best practices and evaluating and implementing new technologies. Additional program
components will include raising cybersecurity
awareness, increasing criminal justice activities,
and developing national security programs to
deter future cyber threats.

T H E N AT I O N A L S T R AT E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S PA C E 3

I N T R O D U C T I O N

Priority III: A National Cyberspace
Security Awareness and Training
Program
Many information-system vulnerabilities exist
because of a lack of cyberspace security
awareness on the part of computer users,
systems administrators, technology developers,
procurement officials, auditors, chief information officers, chief executive officers, and
corporate boards. These vulnerabilities can
present serious risks to the infrastructures even
if they are not actually part of the infrastructure
itself. A lack of trained personnel and the
absence of widely accepted, multi-level certifications for personnel further complicate the
task of reducing vulnerabilities.
The National Cyberspace Security Awareness
and Training Program will raise cybersecurity
awareness in companies, government agencies,
universities, and among the Nation’s computer
users. It will further address shortfalls in the
numbers of trained and certified cybersecurity
personnel.

Priority IV: Securing Governments’
Cyberspace
Although governments administer only a
minority of the Nation’s critical infrastructure
computer systems, governments at all levels
perform essential services that rely on each of
the critical infrastructure sectors, which are
agriculture, food, water, public health,
emergency services, government, defense industrial base, information and telecommunications,
energy, transportation, banking and finance,
chemicals and hazardous materials, and postal
and shipping. With respect to investment in
cyberspace security, government can lead by

example by fostering a marketplace for more
secure technologies through large procurements
of advanced information assurance technologies.
A program to implement such products will
help to ensure that federal computer systems
and networks are secure. The federal
government will also assist state and local
governments with cybersecurity awareness,
training, and information exchange.

Priority V: National Security and
International Cyberspace Security
Cooperation
America’s cyberspace links the United States to
the rest of the world. A network of networks
spans the planet, allowing malicious actors on
one continent to act on systems thousands of
miles away. Cyber attacks cross borders at light
speed, and discerning the source of malicious
activity is difficult. America must be capable of
safeguarding and defending its critical systems
and networks—regardless of where an attack
originates. Facilitating our ability to do so
requires a system of international cooperation to
enable the information sharing, reduce vulnerabilities, and deter malicious actors.

Actions and Recommendations
The Strategy highlights actions that the federal
government will take and makes recommendations to our partners in nongovernmental
organizations. The actions and recommendations (A/R) are italicized throughout the
Strategy and numbered according to the
associated priority. For example A/R 1-1 is the
first action or recommendation in Priority I.
Appendix A provides a summary of all of the
A/Rs proposed.

Cyberspace Threats and Vulnerabilities
A Case for Action
The terrorist attacks against the United States
that took place on September 11, 2001, had a
profound impact on our Nation. The federal
government and society as a whole have been
forced to reexamine conceptions of security on
our home soil, with many understanding only
for the first time the lengths to which selfdesignated enemies of our country are willing to
go to inflict debilitating damage.
We must move forward with the understanding
that there are enemies who seek to inflict
damage on our way of life. They are ready to
attack us on our own soil, and they have shown
a willingness to use unconventional means to
execute those attacks. While the attacks of

September 11 were physical attacks, we are
facing increasing threats from hostile adversaries in the realm of cyberspace as well.

A Nation Now Fully Dependent on
Cyberspace
For the United States, the information
technology revolution quietly changed the way
business and government operate. Without a
great deal of thought about security, the Nation
shifted the control of essential processes in
manufacturing, utilities, banking, and communications to networked computers. As a result,
the cost of doing business dropped and
productivity skyrocketed. The trend toward
greater use of networked systems continues.

T H E N AT I O N A L S T R AT E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S PA C E 5

C Y B E R S P A C E

T H R E A T S

By 2003, our economy and national security
became fully dependent upon information
technology and the information infrastructure.
A network of networks directly supports the
operation of all sectors of our economy—energy
(electric power, oil and gas), transportation (rail,
air, merchant marine), finance and banking,
information and telecommunications, public
health, emergency services, water, chemical,
defense industrial base, food, agriculture, and
postal and shipping. The reach of these
computer networks exceeds the bounds of
cyberspace. They also control physical objects
such as electrical transformers, trains, pipeline
pumps, chemical vats, and radars.

Threats in Cyberspace
A spectrum of malicious actors can and do
conduct attacks against our critical information
infrastructures. Of primary concern is the threat
of organized cyber attacks capable of causing
debilitating disruption to our Nation’s critical
infrastructures, economy, or national security.
The required technical sophistication to carry
out such an attack is high—and partially
explains the lack of a debilitating attack to date.
We should not, however, be too sanguine. There
have been instances where attackers have
exploited vulnerabilities that may be indicative
of more destructive capabilities.
Uncertainties exist as to the intent and full
technical capabilities of several observed
attacks. Enhanced cyber threat analysis is
needed to address long-term trends related to
threats and vulnerabilities. What is known is
that the attack tools and methodologies are
becoming widely available, and the technical
capability and sophistication of users bent on
causing havoc or disruption is improving.
As an example, consider the “NIMDA”
(“ADMIN” spelled backwards) attack. Despite
the fact that NIMDA did not create a
catastrophic disruption to the critical infrastructure, it is a good example of the increased
technical sophistication showing up in cyber

A N D

V U L N E R A B I L I T I E S

attacks. It demonstrated that the arsenal of
weapons available to organized attackers now
contains the capability to learn and adapt to its
local environment. NIMDA was an automated
cyber attack, a blend of a computer worm and a
computer virus. It propagated across the Nation
with enormous speed and tried several different
ways to infect computer systems it invaded until
it gained access and destroyed files. It went
from nonexistent to nationwide in an hour,
lasted for days, and attacked 86,000 computers.
Speed is also increasing. Consider that two
months before NIMDA, a cyber attack called
Code Red infected 150,000 computer systems
in 14 hours.
Because of the increasing sophistication of
computer attack tools, an increasing number of
actors are capable of launching nationally
significant assaults against our infrastructures
and cyberspace. In peacetime America’s enemies
may conduct espionage on our Government,
university research centers, and private
companies. They may also seek to prepare for
cyber strikes during a confrontation by mapping
U.S. information systems, identifying key
targets, lacing our infrastructure with back
doors and other means of access. In wartime or
crisis, adversaries may seek to intimidate the
nation’s political leaders by attacking critical
infrastructures and key economic functions or
eroding public confidence in information
systems.
Cyber attacks on U.S. information networks can
have serious consequences such as disrupting
critical operations, causing loss of revenue and
intellectual property, or loss of life. Countering
such attacks requires the development of robust
capabilities where they do not exist today if we
are to reduce vulnerabilities and deter those
with the capabilities and intent to harm our
critical infrastructures.
Cyberspace provides a means for organized
attack on our infrastructure from a distance.
These attacks require only commodity

technology, and enable attackers to obfuscate
their identities, locations, and paths of entry.
Not only does cyberspace provide the ability to
exploit weaknesses in our critical infrastructures,
but it also provides a fulcrum for leveraging
physical attacks by allowing the possibility of
disrupting communications, hindering U.S.
defensive or offensive response, or delaying
emergency responders who would be essential
following a physical attack.

impending attack. Vulnerability assessment and
remediation activities must be ongoing. An
information technology security audit
conducted by trained professionals to identify
infrastructure vulnerabilities can take months.
Subsequently, the process of creating a multilayered defense and a resilient network to
remedy the most serious vulnerabilities could
take several additional months. The process
must then be regularly repeated.

In the last century, geographic isolation helped
protect the United States from a direct physical
invasion. In cyberspace national boundaries
have little meaning. Information flows continuously and seamlessly across political, ethnic, and
religious divides. Even the infrastructure that
makes up cyberspace—software and hardware—
is global in its design and development. Because
of the global nature of cyberspace, the vulnerabilities that exist are open to the world and
available to anyone, anywhere, with sufficient
capability to exploit them.

Threat and Vulnerability: A Five-Level
Problem

Reduce Vulnerabilities in the Absence
of Known Threats

Level 1, the Home User/Small Business

While the Nation’s critical infrastructures
must, of course, deal with specific threats as
they arise, waiting to learn of an imminent
attack before addressing important critical
infrastructure vulnerabilities is a risky and
unacceptable strategy. Cyber attacks can burst
onto the Nation’s networks with little or no
warning and spread so fast that many victims
never have a chance to hear the alarms. Even
with forewarning, they likely would not have
had the time, knowledge, or tools needed
to protect themselves. In some cases creating
defenses against these attacks would have
taken days.
A key lesson derived from these and other such
cyber attacks is that organizations that rely on
networked computer systems must take
proactive steps to identify and remedy their
vulnerabilities, rather than waiting for an
attacker to be stopped or until alerted of an

Managing threat and reducing vulnerability in
cyberspace is a particularly complex challenge
because of the number and range of different
types of users. Cyberspace security requires
action on multiple levels and by a diverse group
of actors because literally hundreds of millions
of devices are interconnected by a network of
networks. The problem of cyberspace security
can be best addressed on five levels.

Though not a part of a critical infrastructure
the computers of home users can become part
of networks of remotely controlled machines
that are then used to attack critical infrastructures. Undefended home and small business
computers, particularly those using digital
subscriber line (DSL) or cable connections, are
vulnerable to attackers who can employ the use
of those machines without the owner’s
knowledge. Groups of such “zombie” machines
can then be used by third-party actors to launch
denial-of-service (DoS) attacks on key Internet
nodes and other important enterprises or
critical infrastructures.
Level 2, Large Enterprises
Large-scale enterprises (corporations,
government agencies, and universities) are
common targets for cyber attacks. Many such
enterprises are part of critical infrastructures.
Enterprises require clearly articulated, active

T H E N AT I O N A L S T R AT E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S PA C E 7

C Y B E R S P A C E

T H R E A T S

information security policies and programs to
audit compliance with cybersecurity best
practices. According to the U.S. intelligence
community, American networks will be increasingly targeted by malicious actors both for the
data and the power they possess.
Level 3, Critical Sectors/Infrastructures
When organizations in sectors of the economy,
government, or academia unite to address
common cybersecurity problems, they can often
reduce the burden on individual enterprises.
Such collaboration often produces shared institutions and mechanisms, which, in turn, could
have cyber vulnerabilities whose exploitation
could directly affect the operations of member
enterprises and the sector as a whole.
Enterprises can also reduce cyber risks by
participating in groups that develop best
practices, evaluate technological offerings,
certify products and services, and share information.
Several sectors have formed Information
Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) to
monitor for cyber attacks directed against their
respective infrastructures. ISACs are also a
vehicle for sharing information about attack
trends, vulnerabilities, and best practices.
Level 4, National Issues and Vulnerabilities
Some cybersecurity problems have national
implications and cannot be solved by individual
enterprises or infrastructure sectors alone. All
sectors share the Internet. Accordingly, they are
all at risk if its mechanisms (e.g., protocols and
routers) are not secure. Weaknesses in widely
used software and hardware products can also
create problems at the national level, requiring
coordinated activities for the research and
development of improved technologies.
Additionally, the lack of trained and certified
cybersecurity professionals also merits nationallevel concern.

A N D

V U L N E R A B I L I T I E S

Level 5, Global
The worldwide web is a planetary information
grid of systems. Internationally shared standards
enable interoperability among the world’s
computer systems. This interconnectedness,
however, also means that problems on one
continent have the potential to affect computers
on another. We therefore rely on international
cooperation to share information related to
cyber issues and, further, to prosecute cyber
criminals. Without such cooperation, our
collective ability to detect, deter, and minimize
the effects of cyber-based attacks would be
greatly diminished.

New Vulnerabilities Requiring
Continuous Response
New vulnerabilities are created or discovered
regularly. The process of securing networks and
systems, therefore, must also be continuous.
The Computer Emergency Response
Team/Coordination Center (CERT/CC) notes
that not only are the numbers of cyber incidents
and attacks increasing at an alarming rate, so
too are the numbers of vulnerabilities that an
attacker could exploit. Identified computer
security vulnerabilities—faults in software and
hardware that could permit unauthorized
network access or allow an attacker to cause
network damage—increased significantly from
2000 to 2002, with the number of vulnerabilities going from 1,090 to 4,129.
The mere installation of a network security
device is not a substitute for maintaining and
updating a network’s defenses. Ninety percent
of the participants in a recent Computer
Security Institute survey reported using
antivirus software on their network systems, yet
85 percent of their systems had been damaged
by computer viruses. In the same survey, 89
percent of the respondents had installed
computer firewalls, and 60 percent had
intrusion detection systems. Nevertheless, 90
percent reported that security breaches had
taken place, and 40 percent of their systems had

been penetrated from outside their network.
The majority of security vulnerabilities can be
mitigated through good security practices. As
these survey numbers indicate, however,
practicing good security includes more than
simply installing those devices. It also requires
operating them correctly and keeping them
current through regular patching and virus
updates.

Cybersecurity and Opportunity Cost
For individual companies and the national
economy as a whole, improving computer
security requires investing attention, time, and
money. For fiscal year 2003, President Bush
requested that Congress increase funds to
secure federal computers by 64 percent.
President Bush’s investment in securing federal
computer networks now will eventually reduce
overall expenditures through cost-saving
E-Government solutions, modern enterprise
management, and by reducing the number of
opportunities for waste and fraud.

For the national economy—particularly
its information technology industry
component—the dearth of trusted, reliable,
secure information systems presents a barrier to
future growth. Much of the potential for
economic growth made possible by the
information technology revolution has yet to be
realized—deterred in part by cyberspace
security risks. Cyberspace vulnerabilities place
more than transactions at risk; they jeopardize
intellectual property, business operations,
infrastructure services, and consumer trust.
Conversely, cybersecurity investments result in
more than costly overhead expenditures. They
produce a return on investment. Surveys
repeatedly show that:
• Although the likelihood of suffering a
severe cyber attack is difficult to estimate,
the costs associated with a successful one
are likely to be greater than the investment
in a cybersecurity program to prevent it; and

T H E N AT I O N A L S T R AT E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S PA C E 9

C Y B E R S P A C E

T H R E A T S

• Designing strong security protocols into
the information systems architecture of an
enterprise can reduce its overall operational costs by enabling cost-saving
processes, such as remote access and
customer or supply-chain interactions,
which could not occur in networks lacking
appropriate security.
These results suggest that, with greater
awareness of the issues, companies can benefit
from increasing their levels of cybersecurity.
Greater awareness and voluntary efforts are
critical components of the National Strategy to
Secure Cyberspace.

from attacks that do occur. Through this
statement, we reveal nothing to potential foes
that they and others do not already know. In
1997 a Presidential Commission identified the
risks in a seminal public report. In 2000 the
first national plan to address the problem was
published. Citing these risks, President Bush
issued an Executive Order in 2001, making
cybersecurity a priority, and accordingly,
increasing funds to secure federal networks.
In 2002 the President moved to consolidate and
strengthen federal cybersecurity agencies as
part of the proposed Department of Homeland
Security.

Individual and National Risk
Management
Until recently overseas terrorist networks had
caused limited damage in the United States. On
September 11, 2001, that quickly changed. One
estimate places the increase in cost to our
economy from attacks to U.S. information
systems at 400 percent over four years. While
those losses remain relatively limited, that too
could change abruptly.
Every day in the United States individual
companies, and home computer users, suffer
damage from cyber attacks that, to the victims,
represent significant losses. Conditions likewise
exist for relative measures of damage to occur
on a national level, affecting the networks and
systems on which the Nation depends:

• Potential adversaries have the intent;
• Tools that support malicious activities are
broadly available; and,
• Vulnerabilities of the Nation’s systems are
many and well known.
No single strategy can completely eliminate
cyberspace vulnerabilities and their associated
threats. Nevertheless, the Nation must act to
manage risk responsibly and to enhance its
ability to minimize the damage that results

Government Alone Cannot Secure
Cyberspace
Despite increased awareness around the
importance of cybersecurity and the measures
taken thus far to improve our capabilities, cyber
risks continue to underlie our national information networks and the critical systems they
manage. Reducing that risk requires an
unprecedented, active partnership among
diverse components of our country and our
global partners.

A N D

V U L N E R A B I L I T I E S

The federal government could not—and,
indeed, should not—secure the computer
networks of privately owned banks, energy
companies, transportation firms, and other parts
of the private sector. The federal government
should likewise not intrude into homes and
small businesses, into universities, or state and
local agencies and departments to create secure
computer networks. Each American who
depends on cyberspace, the network of
information networks, must secure the part that
they own or for which they are responsible.

National Policy and Guiding Principles
National Policy, Principles, and
Organization
This section describes the national policy that
shapes the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace
and the basic framework of principles within
which it was developed. It also outlines the
roles and missions of federal agencies.

National Policy
The information technology revolution has
changed the way business is transacted,
government operates, and national defense is
conducted. These three functions now depend
on an interdependent network of critical information infrastructures that we refer to as
“cyberspace.”

It is the policy of the United States to prevent
or minimize disruptions to critical information
infrastructures and thereby protect the people,
the economy, the essential human and
government services, and the national security
of the United States. Disruptions that do occur
should be infrequent, of minimal duration and
manageable and cause the least damage
possible. The policy requires a continuous effort
to secure information systems for critical infrastructure and includes voluntary public-private
partnerships involving corporate and
nongovernmental organizations.
Consistent with the objectives of the National
Strategy for Homeland Security, the objectives of
the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace are to:

G U I D I N G

• Prevent cyber attacks against our critical
infrastructures;

• Identify instances where the “tragedy
of the commons” can affect
homeland, national, and economic
security; and

• Reduce our national vulnerabilities to
cyber attack; and,

• Share information about cyber
threats and vulnerabilities so
nongovernmental entities can adjust
their risk management strategies and
plans, as appropriate.

• Minimize the damage and recovery time
from cyber attacks that do occur.

Guiding Principles
In January 2001, the Administration began to
review the role of information systems and
cybersecurity. In October 2001, President Bush
issued Executive Order 13231, authorizing a
protection program that consists of continuous
efforts to secure information systems for critical
infrastructure, including emergency
preparedness communications and the physical
assets that support such systems. The Federal
Information Security Management Act
(FISMA) and Executive Order 13231, together
with other relevant Presidential directives and
statutory authorities, provide the framework for
executive branch cyberspace security
activities.

In every case, the scope for government
involvement is limited to those cases
when the benefits of
intervention outweigh the direct and
indirect costs.
Every American who can contribute to
securing part of cyberspace is
encouraged to do so. The federal
government promotes the creation of,
and participation in, public-private
partnerships to raise awareness, train
personnel, stimulate market forces,
improve technology, identify and
remediate vulnerabilities, exchange
information, and plan recovery operations. Many sectors have undertaken the
important step of developing ISACs,
which facilitate communication, the
development of best practices, and the
dissemination of security-related information. In addition, various sectors have
developed plans to secure their parts of
cyberspace, which complement this
Strategy, and the government intends
for this productive and collaborative
partnership to continue.

The protection of these cyber systems is
essential to every sector of the economy. The
development and implementation of this
program directive has been guided by the
following organizing principles:
1. A National Effort: Protecting the widely
distributed assets of cyberspace requires
the efforts of many Americans. The
federal government alone cannot defend
America’s cyberspace. Our traditions of
federalism and limited government
require that organizations outside the
federal government take the lead in many
of these efforts. The government’s role in
securing cyberspace includes promoting
better security in privately owned infrastructures when there is a need to:
• Convene and facilitate discussions
between and with nongovernmental
entities;

P R I N C I P L E S

2. Protect Privacy and Civil Liberties: The
abuse of cyberspace infringes on our
privacy and our liberty. It is incumbent
on the federal government to avoid such
abuse and infringement. Cybersecurity
and personal privacy need not be
opposing goals. Cyberspace security
programs must strengthen, not weaken,
such protections. Accordingly, care must
be taken to respect privacy interests and

14 T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E

N A T I O N A L

P O L I C Y

other civil liberties. Consumers and
operators must have confidence their
voluntarily shared, nonpublic information
will be handled accurately, confidentially,
and reliably. The federal government will
lead by example in implementing strong
privacy policies and practices in the
agencies. As part of this process, the
federal government will consult regularly
with privacy advocates and experts.
3. Regulation and Market Forces: federal
regulation will not become a primary
means of securing cyberspace. Broad
regulations mandating how all corporations must configure their information
systems could divert more successful
efforts by creating a lowest-commondenominator approach to cybersecurity,
which evolving technology would quickly
marginalize. Even worse, such an
approach could result in less secure and
more homogeneous security architectures
than we have now. By law, some federal
regulatory agencies already include cybersecurity considerations in their oversight
activity. However, the market itself is
expected to provide the major impetus to
improve cybersecurity.
4. Accountability and Responsibility: The
National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace is
focused on producing a more resilient
and reliable information infrastructure.
When possible, it designates lead
executive branch departments or agencies
for federal cyberspace security initiatives.
On November 25, 2002, the President
signed the Homeland Security Act of 2002
establishing the Department of
Homeland Security (DHS). DHS will be
responsible for many of the initiatives
outlined in the National Strategy to Secure
Cyberspace. The Strategy also recommends
actions federal, state and local governments, the private sector, and the
American people can take to help secure
cyberspace.

A N D

G U I D I N G

P R I N C I P L E S

5. Ensure Flexibility: Cyber threats change
rapidly. Accordingly, the National Strategy
to Secure Cyberspace emphasizes flexibility
in our ability to respond to cyber attacks
and manage vulnerability reduction. The
rapid development of attack tools
provides potential attackers with a
strategic advantage to adapt their
offensive tactics quickly to target
perceived weaknesses in networked information systems and organizations’
abilities to respond. Flexible planning
allows organizations to reassess priorities
and realign resources as the cyber threat
evolves.
6. Multi-Year Planning: Securing cyberspace
is an ongoing process, as new
technologies appear and new vulnerabilities are identified. The National Strategy
to Secure Cyberspace provides an initial
framework for achieving cyberspace
security objectives. Departments and
agencies should adopt multi-year cybersecurity plans for sustaining their respective
roles. Other public- and private-sector
organizations are also encouraged to
consider multi-year plans.

Department of Homeland Security and
Cyberspace Security
DHS unites 22 federal entities for the common
purpose of improving homeland security. The
Department also creates a focal point for
managing cyberspace incidents that could
impact the federal government or even the
national information infrastructures. The
Secretary of Homeland Security will have
important responsibilities in cyberspace security,
including:
• Developing a comprehensive national plan
for securing the key resources and critical
infrastructures of the United States,
including information technology and
telecommunications systems (including

Designation of Coordinating Agencies
A productive partnership between the federal
government and the private sector depends on
effective coordination and communication. To
facilitate and enhance this collaborative
structure, the government has designated
a “Lead Agency” for each of the major sectors
of the economy vulnerable to infrastructure
attack. In addition, the Office of Science and
Technology Policy (OSTP) coordinates research
and development to support critical infrastructure protection. The Office of
Management and Budget (OMB) oversees the
implementation of governmentwide policies,
principles, standards, and guidelines for federal
government computer security programs. The
Department of State coordinates international
outreach on cybersecurity. The Director of
Central Intelligence is responsible for assessing
the foreign threat to U.S. networks and information systems. The Department of Justice
(DOJ) and the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI) lead the national effort to investigate and
prosecute cybercrime.

A N D

G U I D I N G

P R I N C I P L E S

The government will continue to support the
development of public-private partnerships.
Working together, sector representatives and
federal lead agencies assess their respective
sectors’ vulnerabilities to cyber or physical
attacks and, accordingly, recommend plans or
measures to eliminate significant exposures.
Both technology and the threat environment
can change rapidly. Therefore, sectors and
lead agencies should frequently assess the
reliability, vulnerability, and threat environments
of the Nation’s infrastructures and employ
appropriate protective measures and responses
to safeguard them.
The government’s full authority, capabilities,
and resources must be available to support
critical infrastructure protection efforts. These
include, as appropriate, crisis management, law

and defense preparedness.

Priority I: A National Cyberspace
Security Response System
In the 1950s and 1960s, our Nation became
vulnerable to attacks from aircraft and missiles
for the first time. The federal government
responded by creating a national system to:
monitor our airspace with radar to detect
unusual activity, analyze and warn of possible
attacks, coordinate our fighter aircraft defenses
during an attack, and restore our Nation after
an attack through civil defense programs.
Today, the Nation’s critical assets could be
attacked through cyberspace. The United States
now requires a different kind of national
response system in order to detect potentially
damaging activity in cyberspace, to analyze
exploits and warn potential victims, to

coordinate incident responses, and to restore
essential services that have been damaged.
The fact that the vast majority of cyberspace is
neither owned nor operated by any single group
—public or private—presents a challenge for
creating a National Cyberspace Security
Response System. There is no synoptic or
holistic view of cyberspace. Therefore, there is
no panoramic vantage point from which we can
see attacks coming or spreading. Information
that indicates an attack has occurred (worms,
viruses, denial-of-service attacks) accumulates
through many different organizations. However,
there is no organized mechanism for reviewing

T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E 19

P R I O R I T Y

these indicators and determining their
implications.
To mitigate the impact of cyber attacks, information about them must disseminate widely
and quickly. Analytical and incident response
capabilities that exist in numerous organizations
could be coordinated to determine how to best
defend against an attack, mitigate effects, and
restore service.
Establishing a proper administrative mechanism
for the National Cyberspace Security Response
System presents another challenge. Unlike the
U.S. airspace-monitoring program during the
Cold War, individuals who operate the systems
that enable and protect cyberspace usually are
not federal employees. Thus, the National
Cyberspace Security Response System must
operate from a less formal, collaborative
network of governmental and nongovernmental
organizations.
DHS is responsible for developing the national
cyberspace security response system, which
includes:
• Providing crisis management support in
response to threats to, or attacks on,
critical information systems; and
• Coordinating with other agencies of the
federal government to provide specific
warning information, and advice about
appropriate protective measures and
countermeasures, to state and local
government agencies and authorities,
the private sector, other entities, and
the public.
DHS will lead and synchronize efforts for the
National Cyberspace Security Response System
as part of its overall information sharing and
crisis coordination mandate; however, the
system itself will consist of many organizations
from both government and private sectors. The
authorizing legislation for the Department of
Homeland Security also created the position of
a privacy officer to ensure that any mechanisms

I

The National Cyberspace Security
Response System
The National Cyberspace Security
Response System is a public-private architecture, coordinated by the Department of
Homeland Security, for analyzing and
warning; managing incidents of national
significance; promoting continuity in
government systems and private sector
infrastructures; and increasing information
sharing across and between organizations to
improve cyberspace security. The National
Cyberspace Security Response System will
include governmental entities and
nongovernmental entities, such as private
sector information sharing and analysis
centers (ISACs).
associated with the National Cyberspace
Security Response System appropriately balance
its mission with civil liberty and privacy
concerns. This officer will consult regularly with
privacy advocates, industry experts, and the
public at large to ensure broad input and
consideration of privacy issues so that we
achieve solutions that protect privacy while
enhancing security.
Among the system components outlined below
are existing federal programs and new federal
initiatives pending budget-review consideration,
as well as initiatives recommended for our
partners.

A. ESTABLISH PUBLIC-PRIVATE
ARCHITECTURE FOR RESPONDING
TO NATIONAL-LEVEL CYBER
INCIDENTS
Establishing the National Cyberspace Security
Response System will not require an expensive
or bureaucratic federal program. In many cases
the system will augment the capabilities of
several important federal entities with existing
cyberspace security responsibilities, which are

now part of DHS. The synergy that results
from integrating the resources of the National
Communications System, the National
Infrastructure Protection Center’s analysis and
warning functions, the Federal Computer
Incident Response Center, the Office of Energy
Assurance, and the Critical Infrastructure
Assurance Office under the purview of the
Under Secretary for Information Analysis and
Infrastructure Protection will help build the
necessary foundation for the National
Cyberspace Security Response System.
The Nation’s private-sector networks are
increasingly targeted, and they will therefore
likely be the first organizations to detect attacks
with potential national significance. Thus,
ISACs will play an increasingly important role
in the National Cyberspace Security Response
System and the overall missions of homeland
security. ISACs possess unique operational
insight into their industries’ core functions and
will help provide the necessary analysis to
support national efforts.
Typically, an ISAC is an industry-led
mechanism for gathering, analyzing, sanitizing,
and disseminating sector-specific security information and articulating and promulgating best

practices. ISACs are designed by the various
sectors to meet their respective needs and
financed through their memberships. DHS will
work closely with ISACs as appropriate to
ensure that they receive timely and actionable
threat and vulnerability data and to coordinate
voluntary contingency planning efforts. The
federal government encourages the private
sector to continue to establish ISACs and,
further, to enhance the analytical capabilities of
existing ISACs.
1. Analysis
a. Provide for the Development of Tactical and
Strategic Analysis of Cyber Attacks and
Vulnerability Assessments
Analysis is the first step toward gaining
important insight about a cyber incident,
including the nature of attack, the information
it compromised, and the extent of damage it
caused. Analysis can also provide an indication
of the intruder’s possible intentions, the
potential tools he used, and the vulnerabilities
he exploited. There are three closely related,
but discrete, categories of analysis related
to cyberspace:

T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E 21

P R I O R I T Y

(i) Tactical analysis examines factors associated
with incidents under investigation or specific,
identified vulnerabilities to generate indications
and warnings. Examples of tactical analysis
include: examining the delivery mechanism of a
computer virus to develop and issue immediate
guidance on ways to prevent or mitigate
damage; and studying a specific computer
intrusion, or set of intrusions, to determine the
perpetrator, his motive, and his method of
attack.
(ii) Strategic analysis looks beyond specific
incidents to consider broader sets of incidents
or implications that may indicate threats of
potential national importance. For example,
strategic analyses may identify long-term trends
related to threat and vulnerability that could be
used to provide advanced warnings of increasing
risks, such as emerging attack methods.
Strategic analysis also provides policymakers
with information they can use to anticipate and
prepare for attacks, thereby diminishing the
damage they cause. Strategic analysis also
provides a foundation to identify patterns that
can support indications and warnings.
(iii) Vulnerability assessments are detailed
reviews of cyber systems and their physical
components to identify and study their
weaknesses. Vulnerability assessments are an
integral part of the intelligence cycle for cyberspace security. These assessments enable
planners to predict the consequences of possible
cyber attacks against specific facilities or sectors
of the economy or government. These projections then allow infrastructure owners and
operators to strengthen their defenses against
various types of threat. (This will be discussed
in the Cyberspace Security Threat and
Vulnerability Reduction Program.)
DHS will foster the development of strong
analytic capabilities in each of these areas. It
should seek partnership and assistance from the
private sector, including the ISACs, in developing these capabilities.

I

2. Warning
a. Encourage the Development of a Private Sector
Capability to Share a Synoptic View of the
Health of Cyberspace
The lack of a synoptic view of the Internet
frustrates efforts to develop Internet threat
analysis and indication and warning capabilities.
The effects of a cyber attack on one sector have
the potential to cascade across several other
sectors, thereby producing significant consequences that could rapidly overwhelm the
capabilities of many private companies and state
and local governments. DHS’s integration of
several key federal cybersecurity operations
centers creates a focal point for the federal
government to manage cybersecurity
emergencies in its own systems, and, if
requested, facilitate crisis management in
non-federal critical infrastructure systems.
Separately, industry is encouraged to develop a
mechanism—whether virtual or physical—that
could enable the sharing of aggregated
information on Internet health to improve
analysis, warning, response, and recovery. To the
extent permitted by law, this voluntary
coordination of activities among nongovernmental entities could enable different network
operators and Internet backbone providers to
analyze and exchange data about attacks. Such
coordination could prevent exploits from
escalating and causing damage or disruption
of vital systems.
DHS will create a single point-of-contact for the
federal government’s interaction with industry and
other partners for 24 x7 functions, including
cyberspace analysis, warning, information sharing,
major incident response, and national-level
recovery efforts. Private sector organizations, which
have major contributions for those functions, are
encouraged to coordinate activities, as permitted by
law, in order to provide a synoptic view of the
health of cyberspace on a 24 x 7 basis. (A/R 1-1)

P R I O R I T Y

b. Expand the Cyber Warning and Information
Network to Support DHS’s Role in
Coordinating Crisis Management for
Cyberspace
Hours and minutes can make a difference
between a major disruption and a manageable
incident. Improving national capabilities for
warning requires a secure infrastructure to
provide assured communications between
critical asset owners and operators and their
service providers. The Cyber Warning and
Information Network (CWIN) will provide an
out-of-band private and secure communications
network for government and industry, with the
purpose of sharing cyber alert and warning
information. The network will include voice
conferencing and data collaboration.
While the first phase was implemented between
the federal government cyber watch centers,
CWIN participants will ultimately include
other critical government and industry partners,
such as ISACs that deal with cyber threats on a
daily basis. As other entities expand in this area,
membership will increase as well. Key to
CWIN membership is the ability to share
sensitive cyber threat information in a secure,
protected, and trusted environment.
As outlined in the 2003 budget, the federal
government will complete the installation of CWIN
to key government cybersecurity-related network
operation centers, to disseminate analysis and
warning information and perform crisis coordination. The federal government will also explore
linking the ISACs to CWIN. (A/R 1-2)
3. National Incident Management
Enhancing analytical capabilities within DHS,
the private sector ISACs, and expanding
CWIN will contribute to the improvement of
national cyber incident management. However,
incident management within the federal
government will still require coordination with
organizations other than those being transferred
to DHS. For example, the Departments of

I

Justice, Defense, and Commerce all have roles
to perform in response to incidents in
cyberspace. Within the White House a number
offices have responsibilities, including the
Office of Science and Technology Policy, which
is responsible for executing emergency telecommunications authorities, the National Security
Council, which coordinates all matters related
to national security and international
cooperation, and the Office of Management
and Budget.
In addition, national incident management
capabilities will also integrate state chief information officers as well as international entities,
as appropriate. (See, Priorities IV and V.)
4. Response and Recovery
a. Create Processes to Coordinate the Voluntary
Development of National Public-Private
Continuity and Contingency Plans
Among the lessons learned from security
reviews following the events of September 11,
2001, was that federal agencies had vastly
inconsistent, and in most cases incomplete,
contingency capabilities for their communications and other systems. Contingency planning
is a key element of cybersecurity. Without
adequate contingency planning and training,
agencies may not be able to effectively handle
disruptions in service and ensure business continuity. OMB, through the Federal Information
Security Management Act requirements and
with assistance from the inspectors general, is
holding agencies accountable for developing
continuity plans.
b. Exercise Cybersecurity Continuity Plans in
Federal Cyber Systems
DHS has the responsibility for providing crisis
management support in response to threats to,
or attacks on, critical information systems
for other government agencies, state and local
governments and, upon request, the private
sector. In order to establish a baseline

T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E 23

P R I O R I T Y

understanding of federal readiness, DHS will
explore exercises for the civilian agencies similar
to the Defense Department “Eligible Receiver”
exercises that test cybersecurity preparedness.
To test civilian agencies’ security preparedness
and contingency planning, DHS will use exercises
to evaluate the impact of cyber attacks on
governmentwide processes. Weaknesses discovered
will be included in agency corrective action plans
and submitted to OMB. DHS also will explore
such exercises as a way to test the coordination of
public and private incident management, response
and recovery capabilities. (A/R 1-3)
(i) Encourage increased cyber risk management
and business continuity. There are a number of
measures that nongovernmental entities can
employ to manage the risk posed by cyberspace
and plan for business continuity. Risk
management is a discipline that involves risk
assessment, risk prevention, risk mitigation, risk
transfer, and risk retention.
There is no special technology that can make
an enterprise completely secure. No matter how
much money companies spend on cybersecurity,
they may not be able to prevent disruptions
caused by organized attackers. Some businesses
whose products or services directly or indirectly
impact the economy or the health, welfare or
safety of the public have begun to use cyber risk
insurance programs as a means of transferring
risk and providing for business continuity.
An important way to reduce an organization’s
exposure to cyber-related losses, as well as to
help protect companies from operational and
financial impairment, is to ensure that adequate
contingency plans are developed and tested.
Corporations are encouraged to regularly review
and exercise IT continuity plans and to consider
diversity in IT service providers as a way of
mitigating risk. (A/R 1-4)

I

(ii) Promote public-private contingency planning
for cybersecurity. It may not be possible to
prevent a wide-range of cyber attacks. For those
attacks that do occur, the Nation needs an
integrated public-private plan for responding to
significant outages or disruptions in cyberspace.
Some organizations have plans for how they
will recover their cyber network and capabilities
in the event of a major outage or catastrophe.
However, there is no mechanism for coordinating such plans across an entire infrastructure
or at a national level.
The legislation establishing DHS also provides
a trusted mechanism for private industry to
develop contingency planning by using the
voluntary preparedness planning provisions that
were established in the Defense Production Act
of 1950, as amended.
Infrastructure sectors are encouraged to establish
mutual assistance programs for cybersecurity
emergencies. DoJ and the Federal Trade
Commission should work with the sectors to address
barriers to such cooperation, as appropriate. In
addition, DHS’s Information Analysis and
Infrastructure Protection Directorate will
coordinate the development and regular update of
voluntary, joint government-industry cybersecurity
contingency plans, including a plan for recovering
Internet functions. (A/R 1-5)

B. INFORMATION SHARING
1. Improve and Enhance Public-Private
Information Sharing about Cyber Attacks,
Threats, and Vulnerabilities
Successfully developing capabilities for analysis,
indications, and warnings requires a voluntary
public-private information sharing effort. The
voluntary sharing of information about such
incidents or attacks is vital to cybersecurity.
Real or perceived legal obstacles make some
organizations hesitant to share information
about cyber incidents with the government or
with each other. First, some fear that shared
data that is confidential, proprietary, or

24 T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E

P R I O R I T Y

potentially embarrassing could become subject
to public examination when shared with the
government. Second, concerns about competitive advantage may impede information
sharing between companies within an industry.
Finally, in some cases, the mechanisms are
simply not yet in place to allow efficient sharing
of information.
The legislation establishing DHS provides
several specific mechanisms intended to
improve two-way information sharing. First, the
legislation encourages industry to share information with DHS by ensuring that such
voluntarily provided data about threats and
vulnerabilities will not be disclosed in a manner
that could damage the submitter. Second, the
legislation requires that the federal government
share information and analysis with the private
sector as appropriate and consistent with the
need to protect classified and other sensitive
national security information.
As required by law, DHS, in consultation with
appropriate federal agencies, will establish
uniform procedures for the receipt, care, and
storage by federal agencies of critical infrastructure information that is voluntarily
submitted to the government.
The procedures will address how the
Department will:
• Acknowledge the receipt of voluntarily
submitted critical infrastructure information;
• Maintain the information as voluntarily
submitted critical infrastructure information;
• Establish protocols for the care and
storage of such information; and
• Create methods for protecting the confidentiality of the submitting entity while
still allowing the information to be used in
the issuance of notices and warnings for
protection of the critical infrastructure.

I

DHS will raise awareness about the removal of
impediments to information sharing about cybersecurity and infrastructure vulnerabilities between
the public and private sectors. The Department will
also establish an infrastructure protection program
office to manage the information flow, including
the development of protocols for how to care for
“voluntarily submitted critical infrastructure information.” (A/R 1-6)
2. Encourage Broader Information Sharing on
Cybersecurity
Nongovernmental organizations with significant computing resources are encouraged to
take active roles in information sharing organizations. Corporations, colleges, and universities
can play important roles in detecting and
reporting cyber attacks, exploits, or vulnerabilities. In particular, both corporations and
institutions of higher learning can gain from
increased sharing on cyberspace security issues.
Programs such as ISACs, FBI Infragard, or the
United States Secret Service electronic crimes
task forces can also benefit the respective
participants. Because institutions of higher
learning have vast computer resources that can
be used as launch pads for attacks, colleges and
universities are encouraged to consider establishing an on-call point-of-contact to Internet
service providers (ISPs) and law enforcement
officials.
Corporations are encouraged to consider active
involvement in industrywide programs to share
information on IT security, including the potential
benefits of joining an appropriate ISAC. Colleges
and universities are encouraged to consider establishing: (1) one or more ISACs to deal with cyber
attacks and vulnerabilities; and, (2) an on-call
point-of-contact, to Internet service providers and
law enforcement officials in the event that the
school’s IT systems are discovered to be launching
cyber attacks. (A/R 1-7)

Priority II: A National Cyberspace Security
Threat and Vulnerability Reduction
Program
Malicious actors in cyberspace can take many
forms including individuals, criminal cartels,
terrorists, or nation states. While attackers take
many forms, they all seek to exploit vulnerabilities created by the design or implementation of
software, hardware, networks, and protocols to
achieve a wide range of political or economic
effects. As our reliance on cyberspace increases
so too does the scope of damage that malicious
actors can impose.
Waiting to act until we learn that a malicious
actor is about to exploit a particular vulnera-

bility is risky. Such warning information may
not always be available. Even when warning
data is available, remediation of some vulnerabilities may take days, weeks, or even years. As a
result, vulnerabilities must be identified and
corrected in critical networks before threats
surface. The most dangerous vulnerabilities
must be prioritized and reduced in a systematic
fashion.
As technology evolves and new systems are
introduced, new vulnerabilities emerge.
Our strategy cannot be to eliminate all

T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E 27

P R I O R I T Y

vulnerabilities, or to deter all threats. Rather, we
will pursue a three-part effort to:
(1) Reduce threats and deter malicious
actors through effective programs to
identify and punish them;
(2) Identify and remediate those existing
vulnerabilities that could create the most
damage to critical systems, if exploited;
and
(3) Develop new systems with less vulnerability and assess emerging technologies
for vulnerabilities.
The federal government cannot accomplish
these goals acting alone. It can only do so in
partnership with state and local governments
and the private sector. Many federal agencies
must play a part in this effort, which will be led
and coordinated by DHS as part of its overall
vulnerability reduction mandate.
The components of this program are discussed
in this section. They include federal programs
(both existing programs and initiatives that will
be considered as part of the budget decision
making process) and activities that the federal
government recommends to its partners. Many
activities that can be taken by individuals,
companies, and other private organizations to
reduce vulnerabilities will be stimulated and
accelerated through awareness and are discussed
as part of the awareness initiative described in
Priority III.

A. REDUCE THREAT AND DETER
MALICIOUS ACTORS
1. Enhance Law Enforcement’s Capabilities for
Preventing and Prosecuting
The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace is
especially concerned with those threats that
could cause significant damage to our economy
or security through actions taken using or
against our cyber infrastructure. By identifying
threats that would cause us significant harm, we

I I

can reduce the threats to homeland security,
national security, and the economy. Law
enforcement and the national security
community play a critical role in preventing
attacks in cyberspace. Law enforcement plays
the central role in attributing an attack through
the exercise of criminal justice authorities.
Many cyber-based attacks are crimes. As a
result the Justice Department’s Computer
Crime and Intellectual Property Section, the
FBI’s Cyber Division, and the U.S. Secret
Service all play a central role in apprehending
and swiftly bringing to justice the responsible
individuals. When incidents do occur, a rapid
response can stem the tide of an ongoing attack
and lessen the harm that is ultimately caused.
The Nation currently has laws and mechanisms
to ensure quick responses to large incidents.
Ideally, an investigation, arrest, and prosecution
of the perpetrators, or a diplomatic or military
response in the case of a state-sponsored action,
will follow such an incident.
Threat reduction, however, involves more than
prosecution. Analyzing and disseminating
practical information gathered by law
enforcement can help promote national infrastructure security. For example, through various
initiatives such as the FBI Infragard program
and the U.S. Secret Service electronic crimes
task forces, law enforcement can share lessons
learned from attacks with private sector organizations. The information gleaned from
investigations can provide the federal
government and private industry a framework
for examining the robustness of their cybersecurity skill sets, and assist in prioritizing their
limited resources to manage the unique risk of
their enterprise.
Justice and the FBI will need to work closely
with DHS to ensure that the information
gleaned from investigations is appropriately
analyzed and shared with ISACs and other
nongovernmental entities to promote improved
risk management in critical infrastructure
sectors.

28 T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E

P R I O R I T Y

The Nation will seek to prevent, deter, and
significantly reduce cyber attacks by ensuring
the identification of actual or attempted perpetrators followed by an appropriate government
response. In the case of cybercrime this would
include swift apprehension, and appropriately
severe punishment.
DOJ and other appropriate agencies will develop
and implement efforts to reduce cyber attacks and
cyber threats through the following means: (1)
identifying ways to improve information sharing
and investigative coordination within the federal,
state, and local law enforcement community
working on critical infrastructure and cyberspace
security matters, and with other agencies and the
private sector; (2) exploring means to provide sufficient investigative and forensic resources and
training to facilitate expeditious investigation and
resolution of critical infrastructure incidents; and,
(3) developing better data about victims of cybercrime and intrusions in order to understand the
scope of the problem and be able to track changes
over time. (A/R 2-1)
2. Create a Process for National Vulnerability
Assessments to Better Understand the
Potential Consequences of Threats and
Vulnerabilities
a. Assess the Potential Impact of Strategic Cyber
Attacks
To better understand how to further detect and
prevent attacks, the Nation must know the
threat it is facing. To date, no comprehensive
assessment of the impact of a strategic cyber
attack against the United States has been
conducted. Because nation states and terrorists
are developing capabilities for cyber-based
attacks, it is important to understand the
potential impact of such an attack and possible
ways to mitigate the effects. DHS, in coordination with appropriate agencies and the private
sector, will lead in the development and conduct of
a national threat assessment including red teaming,
blue teaming, and other methods to identify the

I I

impact of possible attacks on a variety of targets.
(A/R 2-2)

B. IDENTIFY AND REMEDIATE
EXISTING VULNERABILITIES
Reducing vulnerabilities can be resource
intensive. Accordingly, our national efforts to
identify and remediate vulnerabilities must be
focused to reduce vulnerabilities in a cost
effective and systematic manner. The United
States must reduce vulnerabilities in four major
components of cyberspace, including: (1) the
mechanisms of the Internet; (2) digital control

How the Internet Works
Data sent from one computer to another
across the Internet is broken into small
packets of information containing
addressing information as well as a portion
of the total message. The packets travel
across the Internet separately and are
reassembled at the receiving computer.
There are two primary protocols that enable
these packets of data to traverse the
complex networks and arrive in an understandable format. These protocols are: (1)
the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
which decomposes data into packets and
ensures that they are reassembled properly
at the destination; and (2) the Internet
Protocol (IP), which guides or routes the
packets of data though the Internet.
Together they are referred to as TCP/IP.
IP is essential to almost all Internet
activities including sending data such as
e-mail. Data is transmitted based on IP
addresses, which are a series of numbers.
The Domain Name System (DNS) was
developed to simplify the management of
IP addresses. The DNS maps IP numbers
to recognizable sets of letters, words or
numbers. The DNS does this by establishing domains and a structured
hierarchical addressing scheme.

T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E 29

P R I O R I T Y

systems/supervisory control and data acquisition
systems; (3) software and hardware vulnerability
remediation; and, (4) physical infrastructure and
interdependency. These four areas have broad
implications for the majority of the Nation’s
critical infrastructures. Initiating efforts to
eliminate vulnerabilities in these important
areas will reduce the vulnerability of critical
infrastructure services to attack or compromise.
1. Secure the Mechanisms of the Internet
The development and implementation of the
mechanisms for securing the Internet are
responsibilities shared by its owners, operators,
and users. Private industry is leading the effort
to ensure that the core functions of the Internet
develop in a secure manner. As appropriate, the
federal government will continue to support
these efforts. The goal is the development of
secure and robust mechanisms that will enable
the Internet to support the Nation’s needs now
and in the future. This will include securing the
protocols on which the Internet is based,
ensuring the security of the routers that direct
the flow of data, and implementing effective
management practices.
a. Improve the Security and Resilience of Key
Internet Protocols
Essential to the security of the Internet infrastructure is ensuring the reliability and secure
use of three key protocols: the Internet Protocol
(IP), the Domain Name System (DNS), and
the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP).
(i) Internet Protocol. The Internet is currently
based on Internet Protocol version 4 (IPv4).
Some organizations and countries are moving
to an updated version of the protocol, version 6
(IPv6). IPv6 offers several advantages over
IPv4. In addition to offering a vast amount of
addresses, it provides for improved security
features, including attribution and native IP
security (IPSEC), as well as enabling new
applications and capabilities. Some countries are
moving aggressively to adopt IPv6. Japan has

I I

committed to a fully IPv6 based infrastructure
by 2005. The European Union has initiated
steps to move to IPv6. China is also considering
early adoption of the protocol.
The United States must understand the merits
of, and obstacles to, moving to IPv6 and, based
on that understanding, identify a process for
moving to an IPv6 based infrastructure. The
federal government can lead in developing this
understanding by employing IPv6 on some of
its own networks and by coordinating its activities with those in the private sector. The
Department of Commerce will form a task force to
examine the issues related to IPv6, including the
appropriate role of government, international
interoperability, security in transition, and costs
and benefits. The task force will solicit input from
potentially impacted industry segments. (A/R 2-3).
(ii) Secure the Domain Name System. DNS
serves as the central database that helps route
information throughout the Internet. The
ability to route information can be disrupted
when the databases cannot be accessed or
updated or when they have been corrupted.
Attackers can disrupt the DNS by flooding the
system with information or requests or by
gaining access to the system and corrupting or
destroying the information that it contains. The
October 21, 2002 attacks on the core DNS root
servers revealed a vulnerability of the Internet
by degrading or disrupting some of the 13 root
servers necessary for the DNS to function. The
occurrence of this attack punctuates the urgent
need for expeditious action to make such
attacks more difficult and less effective.
(iii) Border Gateway Protocol. Of the many
routing protocols in use within the Internet, the
Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is at greatest
risk of being the target of attacks designed to
disrupt or degrade service on a large scale. BGP
is used to interconnect the thousands of
networks that make up the Internet. It allows
routing information to be exchanged between
networks that may have separate administrators,
administrative policies, or protocols.

P R I O R I T Y

Propagation of false routing information in the
Internet can deny service to small or large
portions of the Internet. For example, false
routes can create “black holes” that absorb
traffic destined for a particular block of address
space. They can also lead to cascade failures
that have occurred in other types of large
routing/switching systems in the past, where
the failure of one switch or mechanism results
in the failure of those connected to it, resulting
in additional waves of failures expanding
outward from the initial fault.
More secure forms of BGP and DNS will
benefit all owners, operators and users of the
Internet. To address this issue, the Internet
Engineering Task Force, a voluntary private
body consisting of users, owners, and operators
of the Internet, has established working groups
for securing BGP and DNS. These groups have
made progress, but have been limited by
technical obstacles and the need for coordination.
The security and continued functioning of the
Internet will be greatly influenced by the
success or failure of implementing more secure
and more robust BGP and DNS. The Nation
has a vital interest in ensuring that this work
proceeds. The government should play a role
when private efforts break down due to a need
for coordination or a lack of proper incentives.
b. Promote Improved Internet Routing
Routers on the Internet share a number of
design characteristics that make them relatively
easy to disable, especially through denial-ofservice (DoS) attacks that overwhelm a router’s
processing capability. Internet routing can be
substantially improved by promoting increased
use of address verification and “out-of-band”
management.
(i) Address Verification. Today there are few
effective solutions available, even commercially,
to mitigate the effect of DoS attacks, as the
scale and lack of address verification and

I I

accountability makes filtering and contacting
the sources of an attack impossible. One of the
largest weaknesses in our current Internet infrastructure is the lack of source address
verification. Establishing an Internet infrastructure that provides forged source address
filtering is a critical step towards defeating these
types of attacks.
(ii) Out-of-Band Management. DoS attacks are
difficult to mitigate because they prevent
control data from reaching the router. Separate
control networks, commonly called “out-ofband” management links, are one technique
that can be used to counter DoS attacks.
DHS will examine the need for increased
research to improve router security through new
technology or approaches to routing information. In particular, DHS will assess progress
on out-of-band management and address
filtering and recommend steps that can be
taken by government or the private sector to
improve their effectiveness and use. In addition,
DHS will work with the private sector to
understand the most efficient path and
obstacles to increasing router security using
current techniques and technology.
c. Improve Management
Much improvement can be made in the security
of the Internet infrastructure if best practices
for managing the Internet, including the data
that flows through it and the equipment that
supports it, are widely employed. DHS will
work with organizations that own and operate
the Internet to develop and promote the
adoption of best practices. In particular, DHS
will work with Internet service providers to help
develop a widely accepted “code of conduct” for
network management. This work will include a
review of existing documented best practices
such as those published by Network Reliability
and Interoperability Council (NRIC) of the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC).

T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E 31

P R I O R I T Y

DHS, in coordination with the Commerce
Department and appropriate agencies, will
coordinate public-private partnerships to encourage:
(1) the adoption of improved security protocols; (2)
the development of more secure router technology;
and, (3) the adoption by ISPs of a “code of good
conduct,” including cybersecurity practices and
security related cooperation. DHS will support these
efforts as required for their success, subject to other
budget considerations. (A/R 2-4)
2. Foster Trusted Digital Control Systems /
Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition
Systems
Many industries in America have radically
transformed the way they control and monitor
equipment over the last 20 years by employing
digital control systems (DCS) and supervisory
control and data acquisition systems (SCADA).
DCS/SCADA are computer-based systems that
are used by many infrastructures and industries
to remotely control sensitive processes and
physical functions that once had to be
controlled manually. DCS and SCADA are
present in almost every sector of the economy
including water, transportation, chemicals,
energy, and manufacturing, among others.
Increasingly DCS/SCADA systems use the
Internet to transmit data rather than the closed
networks used in the past.
Securing DCS/SCADA is a national priority.
Disruption of these systems can have significant
consequences for public health and safety.
However, securing these systems is complicated
by various factors. First, adding security requires
investment in systems and in research and
development that companies cannot afford or
justify on their own. Such research may require
the involvement of multiple infrastructure
operators or industries. Second, current technological limitations could impede the
implementation of security measures. For
example, DCS/SCADA systems are typically
small and self-contained units with limited
power supplies. Security features are not easily
adapted to the space or power requirements. In

I I

addition, these systems operate in real time and
security measures could reduce performance or
impact the synchronization of larger processes.
Both the private and public sectors have a role
in securing SCADA systems. DHS, in coordination with the Department of Energy and
other concerned agencies, will work in
partnership with private industry to ensure that
there is broad awareness among industry
vendors and users, both regulated and unregulated, of the vulnerabilities in DCS/SCADA
systems, and the consequences of exploitation of
those vulnerabilities. For operators of
DCS/SCADA systems, these efforts should
include developing and deploying training and
certification of DCS/SCADA-oriented
software and hardware security. In addition,
DHS will work with the private sector to
promote voluntary standards efforts, and
security policy creation.
The development of adequate test bed environments and the development of technology in
the areas of extremely low latency link
encryptors/authenticators, key management,
and network status/state-of-health monitoring
will aid in the effort to secure DCS/SCADA.
DHS, in coordination with DOE and other
concerned agencies and in partnership with
industry, will develop best practices and new
technology to increase security of DCS/SCADA, to
determine the most critical DCS/SCADA-related
sites, and to develop a prioritized plan for shortterm cybersecurity improvements in those sites.
(A/R 2-5)
3. Reduce and Remediate Software
Vulnerabilities
A third critical area of national exposure is the
many flaws that exist in critical infrastructure
due to software vulnerabilities. New vulnerabilities emerge daily as use of software reveals
flaws that malicious actors can exploit.
Currently, approximately 3,500 vulnerabilities
are reported annually. Corrections are usually
completed by the manufacturer in the form of a

32 T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E

P R I O R I T Y

patch and made available for distribution to fix
the flaws.
Many known flaws, for which solutions are
available, remain uncorrected for long periods of
time. For example, the top ten known vulnerabilities account for the majority of reported
incidents of cyber attacks. This happens for
multiple reasons. Many system administrators
may lack adequate training or may not have
time to examine every new patch to determine
whether it applies to their system. The software
to be patched may affect a complex set of interconnected systems that take a long time to test
before a patch can be installed with confidence.
If the systems are critical, it could be difficult to
shut them down to install the patch.
Unpatched software in critical infrastructures
makes those infrastructures vulnerable to
penetration and exploitation. Software flaws are
exploited to propagate “worms” that can result
in denial of service, disruption, or other serious
damage. Such flaws can be used to gain access
to and control over physical infrastructure.
Improving the speed, coverage, and effectiveness of remediation of these vulnerabilities
is important for both the public and private
sector.
Several steps will help. First, the Nation needs a
better-defined approach to the disclosure of
vulnerabilities. The issue is complex because
exposing vulnerabilities both helps speed the
development of solutions and also creates
opportunities for would be attackers. In
addition, the clearinghouse for such disclosures
must be a neutral body between vendors,
security companies, and the public at large.
Today the government partially funds such
organizations. However, the appropriate level
and form for this funding need to be reviewed.
DHS will work with the National Infrastructure
Advisory Council and private sector organizations
to develop an optimal approach and mechanism for
vulnerability disclosure. (A/R 2-6)

I I

A second step that will speed the distribution of
patches in software systems is the creation of
common test-beds. Such test-beds running
applications that are common among
government agencies or companies can speed
patch implementation by testing one time, for
many users, the impact that a patch will have
on a variety of applications. GSA will work with
DHS on an improved approach to implementing a
patch clearinghouse for the federal government.
DHS will also share lessons learned with the
private sector and encourage the development of a
voluntary, industry-led, national effort to develop
a similar clearinghouse for other sectors including
large enterprises. (A/R 2-7)
Finally, best practices in vulnerability remediation should be established and shared in areas
such as training requirements for system
administrators, the use of automated tools, and
management processes for patch implementation. DHS will work with public and private
entities on the development and dissemination
of such practices. More secure initial configurations for shipped cyber products would facilitate
more secure use by making the default set-up
secure rather than insecure. The software
industry is encouraged to consider promoting more
secure “out-of-the-box” installation and implementation of their products, including increasing: (1)
user awareness of the security features in products;
(2) ease-of-use for security functions; and, (3)
where feasible, promotion of industry guidelines and
best practices that support such efforts. (A/R 2-8)
4. Understand Infrastructure Interdependency
and Improve Physical Security of Cyber
Systems and Telecommunications
Reducing the vulnerability of the cyber infrastructure includes mitigating the potentially
devastating attacks on cyberspace that can occur
when key physical linkages are destroyed. The
impact of such attacks can be amplified by
cascading impacts through a variety of
dependant infrastructures affecting both the
economy and the health and welfare of citizens:
a train derailed in a Baltimore tunnel and the

T H E N AT I O N A L S T R AT E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S PA C E

33

P R I O R I T Y

Internet slowed in Chicago; a campfire in New
Mexico damaged a gas pipeline and IT-related
production halted in Silicon Valley; a satellite
spun out of control hundreds of miles above the
Earth and affected bank customers could not
use their ATMs.
Cyberspace has physical manifestations: the
buildings and conduits that support telecommunications and Internet networks. These
physical elements have been designed and built
to create redundancy and avoid single points of
failure. Nonetheless, the carriers and service
providers are encouraged to independently and
collectively continue to analyze their networks
to strengthen reliability and intentional redundancy. The FCC, through its Network
Reliability and Interoperability Council, and the
National Security Telecommunications
Advisory Committee, can contribute to such
efforts and should identify any governmental
impediments to strengthening the national
networks.
DHS will work actively to reduce interdependencies and physical vulnerability. DHS will
establish and lead a public-private partnership to
identify cross-sectoral interdependencies, both cyber
and physical. The partnership will develop plans to
reduce related vulnerabilities in conjunction with
programs proposed in the National Strategy for
Homeland Security. The National Infrastructure
Simulation and Analysis Center in DHS will
support these efforts by developing models to
identify the impact of cyber and physical interdependencies. (A/R 2-9)
DHS also will support, when requested and as
appropriate, voluntary efforts by owners and
operators of information system networks and
network data centers to develop remediation and
contingency plans to reduce the consequences of
large-scale physical damage to facilities supporting
such networks, and to develop appropriate procedures for limiting access to critical facilities.
(A/R 2-10)

C. DEVELOP SYSTEMS WITH FEWER
VULNERABILITIES AND ASSESS
EMERGING TECHNOLOGIES FOR
VULNERABILITIES
As the Nation takes steps to improve the
security of current systems, it must also ensure
that future cyber systems and infrastructure are
built to be secure. This will become increasingly
important as more and more of our daily
economic and physical lives come to depend on
cyber infrastructure. Future security requires
research in cyberspace security topics and a
commitment to the development of more secure
products.
1. Prioritize the Federal Research and
Development Agenda
Federal investment in research for the next
generation of technologies to maintain and
secure cyberspace must keep pace with an
increasing number of vulnerabilities. Flexibility
and nimbleness are important in ensuring that
the research and development process accommodates the dynamic technology environment
in the years ahead.
The Nation will prioritize and provide resources
as necessary to advance the research to secure
cyberspace. A new generation of enabling
technologies will serve to “modernize” the
Internet for rapidly growing traffic volumes,
expanded e-commerce, and the advanced applications that will be possible only when
next-generation networks are widely available.
As a result, national research efforts must be
prioritized to support the transition of cyberspace into a secure, high-speed knowledge and
communications infrastructure for this century.
Vital research is required for this effort. The
Nation must prioritize its cyberspace security
research efforts across all sectors and funding
sources.
To meet these needs, the Director of OSTP will
coordinate the development, and update on an
annual basis, a federal government research and

34 T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E

P R I O R I T Y

development agenda that includes near-term (1-3
years), mid-term (3-5 years), and later (5 years out
and longer) IT security research for Fiscal Year
2004 and beyond. Existing priorities include,
among others, intrusion detection, Internet infrastructure security (including protocols such as BGP
and DNS), application security, DoS, communications security (including SCADA system encryption
and authentication), high-assurance systems, and
secure system composition. (A/R 2-11)

I I

processes and procedures that diminish the possibilities of erroneous code, malicious code, or trap doors
that could be introduced during development.
(A/R 2-14)
2. Assess and Secure Emerging Systems

To optimize research efforts relative to those of the
private sector, DHS will ensure that adequate
mechanisms exist for coordination of research and
development among academia, industry, and
government, and will develop new mechanisms
where needed. (A/R 2-12)

As new technologies are developed they
introduce the potential for new security vulnerabilities. Some new technologies introduce
security weaknesses that are only corrected over
time, with great difficulty, or sometimes not at
all. A person driving in a car around a city, for
example, can access many wireless local area
networks without the knowledge of their
owners unless strong security measures are
added to those systems.

An important goal of cybersecurity research will
be the development of highly secure, trustworthy, and resilient computing systems. In the
future, working with a computer, the Internet,
or any other cyber system may become as
dependable as turning on the lights or the
water.

As telephones and personal digital assistants,
and many other mobile devices, incorporate
more sophisticated operating systems and
connectivity they may require security features
to prevent their exploitation for distributed
attacks on mobile networks and even the
Internet.

The Nation must seek to ensure that future
components of the cyber infrastructure are built
to be inherently secure and dependable for their
users. Development of highly secure and
reliable systems will be pursued, subject to
budgeting constraints, through the national
cyberspace security research agenda.

Emerging areas of research also can produce
unforeseen consequences for security. The
emergence of optical computing and intelligent
agents, as well as in the longer term, developments in areas such as nanotechnology and
quantum computing, among others, will likely
reshape cyberspace and its security. The Nation
must be at the leading edge in understanding
these technologies and their implications for
security.

The private sector is encouraged to consider
including in near-term research and development
priorities, programs for highly secure and trustworthy operating systems. If such systems are
developed and successfully evaluated, the federal
government will, subject to budget considerations,
accelerate procurement of such systems. (A/R 2-13)
In addition, DHS will facilitate a national publicprivate effort to promulgate best practices and
methodologies that promote integrity, security, and
reliability in software code development, including

DHS, in coordination with OSTP and other
agencies, as appropriate, will facilitate communication between the public and private research and
the security communities, to ensure that emerging
technologies are periodically reviewed by the appropriate body within the National Science and
Technology Council, in the context of possible
homeland and cyberspace security implications, and
relevance to the federal research agenda. (A/R 2-15)

Priority III: A National Cyberspace
Security Awareness and Training Program
Everyone who relies on part of cyberspace is
encouraged to help secure the part of cyberspace that they can influence or control.
To do that, users need to know the simple
things that they can do to help to prevent
intrusions, cyber attacks, or other security
breaches. All users of cyberspace have some
responsibility, not just for their own security,
but also for the overall security and health of
cyberspace.
In addition to the vulnerabilities in existing
information technology systems, there are at
least two other major barriers to users and
managers acting to improve cybersecurity:
(1) a lack of familiarity, knowledge, and

understanding of the issues; and (2) an inability
to find sufficient numbers of adequately trained
and/or appropriately certified personnel to
create and manage secure systems.
Among the components of this priority are the
following:
• Promote a comprehensive national
awareness program to empower all
Americans—businesses, the general
workforce, and the general population—
to secure their own parts of cyberspace;
• Foster adequate training and education
programs to support the Nation’s cybersecurity needs;

T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E 37

P R I O R I T Y

• Increase the efficiency of existing federal
cybersecurity training programs; and
• Promote private sector support for wellcoordinated, widely recognized
professional cybersecurity certification.
Key to any successful national effort to enhance
cybersecurity must be a national effort to raise
awareness (of users and managers at all levels)
and maintain an adequate pool of well trained
and certified IT security specialists. The federal
government cannot by itself create or manage
all aspects of such an effort. It can only do so in
partnership with industry, other governments,
and nongovernmental actors.
Many federal agencies must play a part in this
effort, which will be led and coordinated by
DHS. The components of this program will
include the following federal programs (both
existing programs and initiatives which will be
considered as part of the budget decision
making process) and activities, which we
recommend to our partners.

A. AWARENESS
1. Promote a Comprehensive National
Awareness Program to Empower All
Americans—Businesses, the General
Workforce, and the General Population—
to Secure their Own Parts of Cyberspace
In many cases solutions to cybersecurity issues
exist, but the people who need them do not
know they exist or do not know how or where
to find them. In other cases people may not
even be aware of the need to make a network
element secure. A small business, for example,
may not realize that the configuration of its web
server uses a default password that allows
anyone to gain control of the system. Education
and outreach play an important role in making
users and operators of cyberspace sensitive to
security needs. These activities are an important
part of the solution for almost all of the issues
discussed in the National Strategy to Secure

I I I

Cyberspace, from securing digital control systems
in industry, to securing broadband Internet
access at home.
DHS, working in coordination with appropriate
federal, state, and local entities and private sector
organizations, will facilitate a comprehensive
awareness campaign including audience-specific
awareness materials, expansion of the
StaySafeOnline campaign, and development of
awards programs for those in industry making
significant contributions to security. (A/R 3-1)
Increasing awareness and education prepares
private sectors, organizations, and individuals to
secure their parts of cyberspace. Actions taken
by one entity on a network can immediately
and substantially affect one or many others.
Because the insecurity of one participant in
cyberspace can have a major impact on the
others, the actions they take to secure their own
networks contribute to the security of the
whole. For example, a few subverted servers
recently enabled an attack on some of the
Internet Domain Name System root servers
and threatened to disrupt service for many
users. Through improved awareness the Nation
can stimulate actions to secure cyberspace by
creating an understanding at all audience levels
of both cybersecurity issues and solutions. DHS
will lead an effort to increase cybersecurity
awareness for key audiences:
a. Home Users and Small Business
Home users and small business are not part of
the critical infrastructures. However, their
systems are being increasingly subverted by
malicious actors to attack critical systems.
Therefore, increasing the awareness about
cybersecurity among these users contributes to
greater infrastructure security. Home users and
small business owners of cyber systems often
start with the greatest knowledge gap about
cybersecurity.
DHS, in coordination with other agencies and
private organizations, will work to educate the

38 T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E

P R I O R I T Y

general public of home users, students, children,
and small businesses on basic cyberspace safety
and security issues. As part of these efforts,
DHS will partner with the Department of
Education and state and local governments to
elevate the exposure of cybersecurity issues in
primary and secondary schools. In addition, the
Federal Trade Commission will continue to
provide information on cybersecurity for
consumers and small businesses through
http://www.ftc.gov/infosecurity.
DHS, in coordination with the Department of
Education, will encourage and support, where
appropriate subject to budget considerations, state,
local, and private organizations in the development
of programs and guidelines for primary and
secondary school students in cybersecurity. (A/R 3-2)
In recent years, with the spread of “always on”
connections for systems, such as cable modems,
digital subscriber lines (DSL), and wireless and
satellite systems, the security of home user and
small business systems has become more
important not only to the users themselves, but
to others to which they are connected through
the Internet. For example, these connections
generally mean that larger amounts of data can
be sent and done so in a continuous stream.
These two factors can be exploited and used to
attack other systems, possibly even resulting in
nationally significant damage. The Internet
service providers, antivirus software companies,
and operating system/application software
developers that provide services or products to
home users and small businesses can help raise
their awareness of cybersecurity issues.
Home users and small businesses can help the
Nation secure cyberspace by securing their own
connections to it. Installing firewall software and
updating it regularly, maintaining current
antivirus software, and regularly updating
operating systems and major applications with
security enhancements are actions that individuals
and enterprise operators can take to help secure
cyberspace. To facilitate such actions, DHS will
create a public-private task force of private

I I I

companies, organizations, and consumer users
groups to identify ways that providers of information technology products and services, and other
organizations can make it easier for home users and
small businesses to secure their systems. (A/R 3-3)
b. Large Enterprises
The security of large enterprises is important
not only to individual businesses, but to the
Nation as a whole. Large enterprises own major
cyber networks and computing systems that, if
not secure, can be exploited for attacks on other
businesses in an increasingly interconnected
economy, and could, in the case of a massive
attack, have major economic consequences. The
cybersecurity of large enterprises can be
improved through strong management to
ensure that best practices and efficient
technology are being employed, especially in the
areas of configuration management, authentication, training, incident response, and network
management. DHS will continue the work of
sensitizing the owners of these networks to
their vulnerabilities and what can be done to
mitigate them. DHS, working with other
government agencies and private sector organizations, will build upon and expand existing
efforts to direct the attention of key corporate
decision makers (e.g., CEOs and members of
boards of directors) to the business case for
securing their companies’ information systems.
Decision makers can take a variety of steps to
improve the security of their enterprise
networks and to ensure that their networks
cannot be maliciously exploited. Large enterprises are encouraged to evaluate the security of
their networks that impact the security of the
Nation’s critical infrastructures. Such evaluations
might include: (1) conducting audits to ensure effectiveness and use of best practices; (2) developing
continuity plans which consider offsite staff and
equipment; and, (3) participating in industrywide
information sharing and best practice dissemination. (A/R 3-4)

T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E 39

P R I O R I T Y

(i) Insider Threats. Many cyber attacks on enterprise systems are perpetrated by trusted
“insiders.” Insiders are people trusted with legitimate access rights to enterprise information
systems and networks. Such trusted individuals
can pose a significant threat to the enterprise
and beyond. The insider threat poses a key risk
because it provides a potential avenue for
individuals who seek to harm the Nation to
gain access to systems that could support their
malicious objectives. Effectively mitigating the
insider threat requires policies, practices, and
continued training. Three common policy areas
which can reduce insider threat include: (1)
access controls, (2) segregation of duties, and,
(3) effective policy enforcement.
• Poor access controls enable an individual
or group to inappropriately modify,
destroy, or disclose sensitive data or
computer programs for purposes such as
personal gain or sabotage.
• Segregation of duties is important in
assuring the integrity of an enterprise’s
information system. No one person should
have complete control of any system.
• Effective enforcement of an enterprise
security policy can be challenging and
requires regular auditing. New automated
software is beginning to emerge which can
facilitate efficient enforcement of enterprise security. These programs allow the
input of policy in human terms, translation to machine code, and then
monitoring at the packet level of all data
transactions within, and outbound from,
the network. Such software can detect and
stop inappropriate use of networks and
cyber-based resources.
c. Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs)
Awareness plays an especially important role in
increasing the cybersecurity of IHEs. As recent
experience has shown, organized attackers have
collectively exploited many insecure computer
systems traceable to the campus networks of

I I I

higher education as a platform from which to
launch denial-of-service attacks and other
threats to unrelated systems on the Internet.
Such attacks harm not only the targeted
systems, but also the owners of those systems
and those who desire to use their services. IHEs
are subject to exploitation for two reasons: (1)
they possess vast amounts of computing power;
and (2) they allow relatively open access to
those resources. The computing power owned
by IHEs is extensive, covering over 3,000
schools, many with research and significant
central computing facilities.
The higher education community, collectively,
has been actively engaged in efforts to organize
its members and coordinate action to raise
awareness and enhance cybersecurity on
America’s campuses. Most notably, through
EDUCAUSE, the community has raised the
issue of the Strategy’s development with top
leaders of higher education, including the
American Council on Education and the
Higher Education IT Alliance. Significantly,
through this effort, top university presidents
have adopted a 5-point Framework for Action
that commits them to giving IT security high
priority and to adopting the policies and
measures necessary to realize greater system
security:
(1) Make IT security a priority in higher
education;
(2) Revise institutional security policy and
improve the use of existing security
tools;
(3) Improve security for future research and
education networks;
(4) Improve collaboration between higher
education, industry, and government;
and
(5) Integrate work in higher education with
the national effort to strengthen critical
infrastructure.

40 T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E

P R I O R I T Y

Colleges and universities are encouraged to secure
their cyber systems by establishing some or all of the
following as appropriate: (1) one or more ISACs to
deal with cyber attacks and vulnerabilities; (2)
model guidelines empowering Chief Information
Officers (CIOs) to address cybersecurity; (3) one or
more sets of best practices for IT security; and, (4)
model user awareness programs and materials.
(A/R 3-5)
d. Private Sectors
DHS will work with private sectors on general
awareness as well as on specific issues impacting
particular sectors. Private sectors own and
operate the vast majority of the Nation’s cyberspace. As long time partners in the effort to
secure cyberspace, many sectors have developed
plans in parallel with the National Strategy to
Secure Cyberspace to help secure their critical
infrastructures. The sectors can serve a vital role
in the reduction of vulnerabilities by creating
sector-wide awareness of issues that affect
multiple members. Members can develop and
share best practices and work together toward
common security solutions. For example,
SCADA systems are a widespread security issue
in the energy sector. Solutions are being coordinated with the Department of Energy and
across the sector. The sectors also play a role in
the identification of research needs. DHS will
closely coordinate with private sectors on plans
and initiatives to secure cyberspace.
A public-private partnership should continue work
in helping to secure the Nation’s cyber infrastructure
through participation in, as appropriate and
feasible, a technology and R&D gap analysis to
provide input into the federal cybersecurity research
agenda, coordination on the conduct of associated
research, and the development and dissemination of
best practices for cybersecurity. (A/R 3-6)
e. State and Local Governments
DHS will implement plans to focus key
decision makers in state and local governments—such as governors, state legislatures,

I I I

mayors, city managers, and county commissioners/boards of supervisors—to support
investment in information systems security
measures and adopt enforceable management
policies and practices.

B. TRAINING
In addition to raising general awareness, the
Nation must focus resources on training a
talented and innovative pool of citizens that can
specialize in securing the infrastructure. While
the need for this pool has grown quickly with
the expansion of the Internet and the pervasiveness of computers, networks, and other
cyber devices, the investment in training has
not kept pace. Universities are turning out
fewer engineering graduates, and much of their
resources are dedicated to other subjects, such
as biology and life sciences. This trend must be
reversed if the United States is to lead the
world with its cyber economy.
1. Foster Adequate Training and Education
Programs to Support the Nation’s
Cybersecurity Needs
Improvements in cybersecurity training will be
accomplished primarily through the work of
private training organizations, institutions of
learning, and the Nation’s school systems.
DHS will also encourage private efforts to
ensure that adequate opportunities exist for
continuing education and advanced training in
the workplace to maintain high skills standards
and the capacity to innovate.
The federal government can play a direct role in
several ways. First, DHS will implement and
encourage the establishment of programs to advance
the training of cybersecurity professionals in the
United States, including coordination with NSF,
OPM, and NSA, to identify ways to leverage the
existing Cyber Corps Scholarship for Service
program as well as the various graduate, postdoctoral, senior researcher, and faculty development
fellowship and traineeship programs created by the

T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E 41

P R I O R I T Y

Cyber Security Research and Development Act, to
address these important training and education
workforce issues. (A/R 3-7)
2. Increase the Efficiency of Existing Federal
Cybersecurity Training Programs
Second, DHS will explore the benefits of a
center for the development of cybersecurity
training practices that would draw together
expertise and be consistent with the federal
“build once, use many” approach. DHS, in
coordination with other agencies with cybersecurity
training expertise, will develop a coordination
mechanism linking federal cybersecurity and
computer forensics training programs. (A/R 3-8)

C. CERTIFICATION
1. Promote Private Sector Support for Wellcoordinated Widely Recognized Professional
Cybersecurity Certifications
Related to education and training is the need
for certification of qualified persons.
Certification can provide employers and
consumers with greater information about the
capabilities of potential employees or security
consultants. Currently, some certifications for
cybersecurity workers exist; however, they vary
greatly in the requirements they impose. For
example, some programs emphasize broad
knowledge verified by an extensive multiplechoice exam, while others verify in-depth

I I I

practical knowledge on a particular cyber
component. No one certification offers a level
of assurance about a person’s practical and
academic qualifications, similar to those offered
by the medical and legal professions.
To address this issue, a number of industry
stakeholders including representatives of both
consumers and providers of IT security certifications are beginning to explore approaches to
developing nationally recognized certifications
and guidelines for certification.
Aspects that warrant consideration by these
organizations include levels of education and
experience, peer recognition, continuing
education requirements, testing guidance, as
applicable for various levels of certification that
may be established, and models for administering a certification for IT security
professionals similar to those successfully
employed in other professions. DHS and other
federal agencies, as downstream consumers
(prospective employers of certified personnel),
can aid these efforts by effectively articulating
the needs of the federal IT security community.
DHS will encourage efforts that are needed to build
foundations for the development of security certification programs that will be broadly accepted by the
public and private sectors. DHS and other federal
agencies can aid these efforts by effectively articulating the needs of the federal IT security
community. (A/R 3-9)

Priority IV: Securing Governments’
Cyberspace
Although most critical infrastructures are in the
private sector, governments at various levels
perform many key functions. Among those key
functions are national defense, homeland
security, emergency response, taxation,
payments to citizens, central bank activities,
criminal justice, and public health. All of those
functions and others now depend upon information networks and systems. Thus, it is the
duty of governments to secure their information
systems in order to provide essential services. At
the federal level it is also required by law.
The foundation for the federal government’s
cybersecurity requires assigning clear and
unambiguous authority and responsibility for

security, holding officials accountable for
fulfilling those responsibilities, and integrating
security requirements into budget and capital
planning processes.
The federal government will lead by example,
giving cybersecurity appropriate attention and
care, and encouraging others to do so. The
federal government’s procurement practices will
be used to help promote cybersecurity. For
example, federal agencies should become early
adopters of new, more secure systems and
protocols where appropriate.
State and local governments can have a similar
effect on cybersecurity. The federal government

T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E 43

P R I O R I T Y

I V

is ready to partner with both state and local
governments to promote cybersecurity.

1. Continuously Assess Threats and
Vulnerabilities to Federal Cyber Systems

Within the federal government the Director of
OMB is responsible for ensuring that
department and agency heads carry out their
legal responsibilities to secure IT systems, with
the exception of classified systems of national
security departments and agencies that are the
responsibility of the Secretary of Defense and
the Director of Central Intelligence.

A key step to ensuring the security of federal
information technology is to understand the
current state of the effectiveness of security and
privacy controls in individual systems. Once
identified, it is equally important to maintain
that understanding through a continuing cycle
of risk assessment. This approach is reflected in
OMB security policies, and is featured in
FISMA.

A. THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT
Beginning with the Budget Blueprint in
February 2001, continuing in the fiscal year
2002 and 2003 budgets, and the Management
Reform Agenda, this administration has set a
clear agenda for government reform. These
reforms include unifying federal government
security and critical infrastructure protection
initiatives, and making strong security a
condition of funding for all federal investments
in information-technology systems.
The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace
supports these efforts by working to ensure
that the federal government can identify
vulnerabilities, anticipate threats, mitigate
attacks when possible, and provide for
continuity of operations.
To overcome deficiencies in cybersecurity,
OMB established a governmentwide IT
security program, as required by law, to set IT
security policies and perform oversight of
federal agency compliance with security
requirements. This program is based on a costeffective, risk-based approach. Agencies must
ensure that security is integrated within every
IT investment. This approach is designed to
enable federal government business operations,
not to unnecessarily impede those functions.

OMB’s first report to Congress on government
information security reform in February 2002
identified six common governmentwide security
performance gaps.
These weaknesses included:
(1) Lack of senior management attention;
(2) Lack of performance measurement;
(3) Poor security education and awareness;
(4) Failure to fully fund and integrate
security into capital planning and
investment control;
(5) Failure to ensure that contractor services
are adequately secure; and
(6) Failure to detect, report, and share information on vulnerabilities.
These gaps are not new or surprising. OMB,
along with the General Accounting Office and
agency inspectors general, has found them to be
problems for at least 6 years. The evaluation
and reporting requirements established by law
have given OMB and federal agencies an
opportunity to develop a comprehensive, crossgovernment baseline of agency IT security
performance that had not been previously
available. More importantly, through the development and use of corrective action plans, the
federal government has a uniform process to
track progress in fixing those weaknesses.

44 T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E

P R I O R I T Y

Before OMB approves funding for a system an
agency must demonstrate that it has resolved
outstanding security issues related to the
system. Additionally, agencies must ensure that
security has been incorporated and security
costs reported for every IT investment through
the federal capital planning process. OMB
policy stipulates that specific lifecycle security
costs be identified, built into, and funded as
part of each system investment. Failure to do so
results in disapproval of funding for the entire
system.
2. Agency-Specific Processes
The federal government must have a comprehensive and crosscutting approach to improving
cybersecurity. Three processes central to
improving and maintaining federal cybersecurity in the agencies are: identifying and
documenting enterprise architectures; continuously assessing threats and vulnerabilities, and
understanding the risks they pose to agency
operations and assets; and implementing
security controls and remediation efforts to
reduce and manage those risks. Each agency
will be expected to create and implement this
formal three-step process to achieve greater
security.
a. Identify and Document Enterprise Architectures
OMB policy requires each agency to identify
and document their enterprise architecture,
including an authoritative inventory of all
operations and assets, all agency IT systems,
critical business processes, and their interrelationships with other organizations. This
process yields a governmentwide view of critical
security needs.
Through the budget process, the federal
government will drive agency investments in
commercially available tools to improve their
architectures and system configuration.
Configuration management and control has
incidental and important benefits to security.
For example, controlling system configuration

I V

permits agencies to more effectively and
efficiently enforce policies and permissions and
more easily install antivirus definitions and
other software updates and patches across an
entire system or network.
b. Continuously Assess Threats and Vulnerabilities
Commercially available automated auditing and
reporting mechanisms should be used to
validate the effectiveness of the security controls
across a system and are essential to continuously
understand risks to those systems. These tools
can help in analyzing data, providing forwardlooking assessments, and alerting agencies of
unacceptable risks to their operations.
Federal agencies will continue to expand the use of
automated, enterprise-wide security assessment and
security policy enforcement tools and actively deploy
threat management tools to deter attacks. The
federal government will determine whether specific
actions are necessary (e.g., through the policy or
budget processes) to promote the greater use of these
tools. (A/R 4-1)
c. Implement Security Controls and Remediation
Efforts
The implementation of security controls that
maintain risk at an acceptable level can often be
accomplished in a relatively brief amount of
time. However, the remediation of vulnerabilities is a much more complex challenge.
Software is constantly changing and each new
upgrade can introduce new vulnerabilities. As a
result, vulnerabilities must be assessed continuously. Remediation often involves “patching” or
installing pieces of software or code that are
used to update the main program. The remediation of federal systems must be planned in a
consistent fashion.

T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E 45

P R I O R I T Y

B. ADDITIONAL GOVERNMENTWIDE
CHALLENGES
In addition, there are four specific governmentwide security challenges that need to be
addressed. Each agency, as appropriate, should
work with OMB to resolve these challenges.
1. Authenticate and Maintain Authorization
for Users of Federal Systems
Identifying and authenticating each system user
is the first link in the system security chain, and
it must take place whenever system access is
initiated. To establish and maintain secure
system operations, organizations must ensure
that the people on the system are who they say
they are and are doing only what they are
authorized to do. Many authentication procedures used today are inadequate. Passwords are
not being changed from the system default, are
often incorrectly configured, and are rarely
updated.
The federal government will continue to
promote a continuing chain of security for all
federal employees and processes, including the
use, where appropriate, of biometric smart cards
for access to buildings and computers, and
authentication from the moment of computer
log on. The benefits of such an approach are
clear. By promoting multi-layered identification
and authentication—the use of strong
passwords, smart tokens, and biometrics - the
federal government will eliminate many significant security problems that it has today.
Through the ongoing E-Authentication initiative,
the federal government will review the need for
stronger access control and authentication; explore
the extent to which all departments can employ the
same physical and logical access control tools and
authentication mechanisms; and consequently,
further promote consistency and interoperability.
(A/R 4-2)

The National Information
Assurance Partnership (NIAP)
NIAP is a U.S. Government initiative to
meet testing, evaluation, and assessment
needs of both information technology (IT)
producers and consumers. NIAP is a
collaboration between the National
Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST) and the National Security Agency
(NSA) in fulfilling their respective responsibilities under the Computer Security Act
of 1987.
The partnership, originated in 1997,
combines the extensive security experience
of both agencies to promote the development of technically sound security
requirements for IT products and systems
and appropriate metrics for evaluating those
products and systems. The long-term goal
of NIAP is to help increase the level of
trust consumers have in their information
systems and networks through the use of
cost-effective security testing, evaluation,
and assessment programs. NIAP continues
to build important relationships with
government agencies and industry in a
variety of areas to help meet current and
future IT security challenges affecting the
Nation’s critical information infrastructure.
More information on the partnership can
be found at http://www.niap.nist.gov.
2. Secure Federal Wireless Local Area
Networks
When using wireless technology, the federal
government will carefully evaluate the risks
associated with using such technology for
critical functions. The National Institute of
Standards and Technology (NIST) notes that
wireless communications can be intercepted
and that wireless networks can also experience
denial-of-service attacks. Federal agencies
should use the NIST findings and

46 T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E

P R I O R I T Y

I V

recommendations on wireless systems as a guide
to the operation of wireless networks.

vendors to submit their product for evaluation
to be further considered.

Federal agencies should consider installing systems
that continuously check for unauthorized connections to their networks. Agency policy and
procedures should reflect careful consideration of
additional risk reduction measures, including the
use of strong encryption, bi-directional authentication, shielding standards and other technical
security considerations, configuration management,
intrusion detection, incident handling, and
computer security awareness and training
programs. (A/R 4-3)

Following this program review, the government
will evaluate the cost effectiveness of expanding
the program to cover all federal agencies. If this
proves workable, it could both improve
government security and leverage the
government’s significant purchasing power to
influence the market and begin to improve the
security of all consumer information technology
products.

3. Improve Security in Government
Outsourcing and Procurement
Through a joint effort of OMB’s Office of
Federal Procurement Policy, the Federal
Acquisition Regulations Council, and the
Executive Branch Information Systems Security
Committee, the federal government is identifying ways to improve security in agency
contracts and evaluating the overall federal
procurement process as it relates to security.
Agencies’ maintenance of security for
outsourced operations was cited as one of the
key weaknesses identified in OMB’s February
2002 security report to Congress.
Additionally, the federal government will be
conducting a comprehensive review of the National
Information Assurance Partnership (NIAP), to
determine the extent to which it is adequately
addressing the continuing problem of security flaws
in commercial software products. This review will
include lessons learned from implementation of the
Defense Department’s July 2002 policy requiring
the acquisition of products reviewed under the
NIAP or similar evaluation processes. (A/R 4-4)
Department of Defense (DOD) policy stipulates that if an evaluated product of the type
being sought is available for use, then the DOD
component must procure the evaluated product.
If no evaluated product is currently available,
the component must require prospective

4. Develop Specific Criteria for Independent
Security Reviews and Reviewers and
Certification
With the growing emphasis on security comes
the corresponding need for expert independent
verification and validation of agency security
programs and practices. FISMA and OMB’s
implementing guidance require that agencies’
program officials and CIOs review at least
annually the status of their programs. Few
agencies have available personnel resources to
conduct such reviews, and thus they frequently
contract for such services. Agencies and OMB
have found that contractor security expertise
varies widely from the truly expert to less than
acceptable. Moreover, many independent verification and validation contractors are also in the
business of providing security program implementation services; thus, their program reviews
may be biased toward their preferred way of
implementing security.
The federal government will explore whether
private sector security service providers to the
federal government should be certified as meeting
certain minimum capabilities, including the extent
to which they are adequately independent. (A/R 4-5)

C. STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS
American democracy is rooted in the precepts
of federalism—a system of government in
which power is allocated between federal and
state governments. This structure of overlapping

T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E 47

P R I O R I T Y

federal, state, and local governance has more
than 87,000 different jurisdictions and provides
unique opportunity and challenges for
cyberspace security efforts. State and local
governments, like the federal government,
operate large, interconnected information
systems upon which critical government
services depend.
States provide services that make up the “public
safety net” for millions of Americans and their
families. Services include essential social
support activities as well as critical public safety
functions, such as law enforcement and
emergency response services. States also own
and operate critical infrastructure systems, such
as electric power and transmission, transportation, and water systems. They play a
catalytic role in bringing together the different
stakeholders that deliver critical services within
their state to prepare for, respond to, manage,
and recover from a crisis. Delivering critical
services unique to their roles and responsibilities
within our federalist system makes state
government a critical infrastructure sector in its
own right.
Many of these critical functions carried out by
states are inexorably tied to IT—including
making payments to welfare recipients,
supporting law enforcement with electronic
access to criminal records, and operating stateowned utility and transportation services.
Preventing cyber attacks and responding
quickly when they do occur, ensures that these
24/7 systems remain available and in place to
provide important services that the public needs
and expects. Information technology systems

I V

have the potential for bringing unprecedented
efficiency and responsiveness from state governments for their residents. Citizen confidence in
the integrity of these systems and the data
collected and maintained by them is essential
for expanded use and capture of these potential
benefits.
With an increasing dependence on integrated
systems, state, local, and federal agencies have
to collectively combat cyber attacks. Sharing
information to protect systems is an important
foundation for ensuring government continuity.
States have adopted several mechanisms to
facilitate the sharing of information on cyber
attacks and in reporting incidents.
These mechanisms are continually modified
and improved as new policy emerges and as
technological solutions become available. In
addition, states are exploring options for
improving information sharing both internally
and externally. These options include enacting
legislation that provides additional funding and
training for cybersecurity and forming partnerships across state, local, and federal
governments to manage cyber threats.
1. DHS will Work with State and Local
Governments and Encourage them to
Consider Establishing IT Security Programs
and to Participate in ISACs with Similar
Governments
State and local governments are encouraged to
establish IT security programs for their departments
and agencies, including awareness, audits, and
standards; and to participate in the established
ISACs with similar governments. (A/R 4-6)

Priority V: National Security and
International Cyberspace Security
Cooperation
America’s cyberspace is linked to that of the rest
of the world. Attacks cross borders at light
speed. Distinguishing between malicious
activity originating from criminals, nation state
actors, and terrorists in real time is difficult.
This requires America to be prepared to defend
critical networks and respond to attacks in each
case. Systems supporting this country’s critical
national defense and the intelligence
community must be secure, reliable, and
resilient—able to withstand attack regardless of
the origin of attack. America must also be
prepared to respond as appropriate to attacks
against its critical infrastructure. At the same

time, America must be ready to lead global
efforts, working with governments and industry
alike, to secure cyberspace that is vital to the
operation of the world’s economy and markets.
Global efforts require raising awareness,
promoting stronger security standards, and
aggressively investigating and prosecuting
cybercrime.

A. ENSURING AMERICA’S NATIONAL
SECURITY
We face adversaries, including nation states and
terrorists, who could launch cyber attacks or

T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E 49

P R I O R I T Y

seek to exploit our systems. In peacetime
America’s enemies will conduct espionage
against our government, university research
centers, and private companies. Activities would
likely include mapping U.S. information
systems, identifying key targets, lacing our
infrastructure with “back doors” and other
means of access. In wartime or crisis, adversaries may seek to intimidate by attacking
critical infrastructures and key economic
functions or eroding public confidence in information systems. They may also attempt to slow
the U.S. military response by disrupting systems
of the Department of Defense (DoD), the
Intelligence Community, and other government
organizations as well as critical infrastructures.
America has already experienced significant
national cybersecurity events. In 1998, attackers
carried out a sophisticated, tightly orchestrated
series of cyber intrusions into the computers of
DoD, NASA, and government research labs.
The intrusions were targeted against those
organizations that conduct advanced technical
research on national security, including atmospheric and oceanographic topics as well as
aircraft and cockpit design.
The United States must have the capability to
secure and defend systems and infrastructures
that are deemed national security assets, and
develop the capability to quickly identify the
origin of malicious activity. We must improve
our national security posture in cyberspace to
limit the ability of adversaries to conduct
espionage or pressure the United States.
1. Strengthen Counterintelligence Efforts in
Cyberspace
The FBI and intelligence community should ensure
a strong counterintelligence posture to counter
cyber-based intelligence collection against the
United States government, and commercial and
educational organizations. This effort must include
a deeper understanding of the capability and intent
of our adversaries to use cyberspace as a means for
espionage. (A/R 5-1)

V

2. Improve Attack Attribution and Prevention
Capabilities
The intelligence community, DoD, and the law
enforcement agencies must improve the Nation’s
ability to quickly attribute the source of threatening
attacks or actions to enable timely and effective
response. Consistent with the National Security
Strategy, these efforts will also seek to develop
capabilities to prevent attacks from reaching critical
systems and infrastructures. (A/R 5-2)
3. Improve Coordination for Responding to
Cyber Attacks within the United States
National Security Community
The United States must improve interagency
coordination between law enforcement, national
security, and defense agencies involving cyber-based
attacks and espionage, ensuring that criminal
matters are referred, as appropriate, among those
agencies. The National Security Council and the
Office of Homeland Security will lead a study to
ensure that appropriate mechanisms are in place.
(A/R 5-3)
4. Reserve the Right to Respond in an
Appropriate Manner
When a nation, terrorist group, or other adversary
attacks the United States through cyberspace, the
U.S. response need not be limited to criminal prosecution. The United States reserves the right to
respond in an appropriate manner. The United
States will be prepared for such contingencies. (A/R
5-4)

B. INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION
The Department of State will lead federal
efforts to enhance international cyberspace
security cooperation. Key initiatives include:
1. Work through International Organizations
and with Industry to Facilitate and to
Promote a Global “Culture of Security”
America’s interest in promoting global cybersecurity extends beyond our borders. Our

50 T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E

P R I O R I T Y

information infrastructure is directly linked
with Canada, Mexico, Europe, Asia, and South
America. The United States and world
economy increasingly depend upon global
markets and multinational corporations
connected via information networks. The vast
majority of cyber attacks originates or passes
through systems abroad, crosses several borders,
and requires international investigative cooperation to be stopped.
Global networks supporting critical economic
and security operations must be secure and
reliable. Securing global cyberspace will require
international cooperation to raise awareness,
increase information sharing, promote security
standards, and investigate and prosecute those
who engage in cybercrime. The United States is
committed to working with nations to ensure
the integrity of the global information networks
that support critical economic and security
infrastructure. We are also ready to utilize
government-sponsored organizations such as
the Organization of Economic Cooperation
and Development (OECD), G-8, the Asia
Pacific Economic Cooperation forum (APEC),
and the Organization of American States
(OAS), and other relevant organizations to
facilitate global coordination on cybersecurity.
In order to facilitate coordination with the
private sector, we will also utilize such organizations as the Transatlantic Business Dialogue.
2. Develop Secure Networks
The United States will engage in cooperative
efforts to solve technical, scientific, and policyrelated problems to assure the integrity of
information networks. We will encourage the
development and adoption of international
technical standards and facilitate collaboration
and research among the world’s best scientists
and researchers. We will promote such efforts as
the OECD’s Guidelines for the Security of
Information Systems and Networks, which strive
to inculcate a “culture of security” across all
participants in the new information society.

V

Because most nations’ key information
infrastructures reside in private hands, the
United States will seek the participation of
United States industry to engage foreign
counterparts in a peer-to-peer dialogue, with
the twin objectives of making an effective
business case for cybersecurity, and explaining
successful means for partnering with
government on cybersecurity.
The United States will work through appropriate
international organizations and in partnership
with industry to facilitate dialogue between foreign
public and private sectors on information infrastructure protection and promote a global “culture of
security.” (A/R 5-5)
3. Promote North American Cyberspace
Security
The United States will work with Canada and
Mexico to make North America a “Safe Cyber
Zone.” We will expand programs to identify and
secure critical common networks that underpin
telecommunications, energy, transportation,
banking and finance systems, emergency services,
food, public health, and water systems. (A/R 5-6)
4. Foster the Establishment of National and
International Watch-and-Warning
Networks to Detect and Prevent Cyber
Attacks as they Emerge
The United States will urge each nation to build on
the common Y2K experience and appoint a
centralized point-of-contact who can act as a
liaison between domestic and global cybersecurity
efforts. Establishing points of contact can greatly
enhance the international coordination and
resolution of cyberspace security issues. We will also
encourage each nation to develop its own watchand-warning network capable of informing
government agencies, the public, and other countries
about impending attacks or viruses. (A/R 5-7)
To facilitate real-time sharing of the threat
information as it comes to light, the United States
will foster the establishment of an international

T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E 51

P R I O R I T Y

network capable of receiving, assessing, and disseminating this information globally. Such a network
can build on the capabilities of nongovernmental
institutions such as the Forum of Incident Response
and Security Teams. (A/R 5-8)
The United States will encourage regional organizations, such as the APEC, EU, and OAS, to each
form or designate a committee responsible for cybersecurity. Such committees would also benefit from
establishing parallel working groups with representatives from the private sector. The United States
will also encourage regional organizations—such as
the APEC, EU, and OAS—to establish a joint
committee on cybersecurity with representatives
from government and the private sector. (A/R 5-9)
5. Encourage Other Nations to Accede to the
Council of Europe Convention on
Cybercrime, or to Ensure that their Laws
and Procedures are at Least as
Comprehensive
The United States will actively foster
international cooperation in investigating and
prosecuting cybercrime. The United States has

V

signed and supports the recently concluded
Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime,
which requires countries to make cyber attacks
a substantive criminal offense and to adopt
procedural and mutual assistance measures to
better combat cybercrime across international
borders.
The United States will encourage other nations to
accede to the Council of Europe Convention on
Cybercrime or to ensure that their laws and procedures are at least as comprehensive. (A/R 5-10)
Ongoing multilateral efforts, such as those in
the G-8, APEC, and OECD are also
important. The United States will work to
implement agreed-upon recommendations and
action plans that are developed in these forums.
Among these initiatives, the United States in
particular will urge countries to join the 24hour, high-tech crime contact network begun
within the G-8, and now expanded to the
Council of Europe membership, as well as
other countries.

Conclusion: The Way Forward
Our reliance on cyberspace will only continue
to grow in the years ahead. Cyberspace and the
networks that connect to it now support our
economy and provide for our national and
homeland defense. This national dependency
must be managed with continuous efforts to
secure the cyber systems that control our infrastructures.
Securing cyberspace is a complex and evolving
challenge. The National Strategy to Secure
Cyberspace was developed in close collaboration
with key sectors of the economy that rely on
cyberspace, state and local governments,
colleges and universities, and concerned organizations. Town hall meetings were held around
the country, and fifty-three clusters of key
questions were published to spark public debate.

In addition, a draft version of the National
Strategy to Secure Cyberspace was shared with the
Nation for public comment. The response has
been overwhelming.
The public-private partnerships that formed in
response to the President’s call have developed
their own strategies to protect the parts of
cyberspace on which they rely. This unique
partnership and process was and will continue
to be necessary because the majority of the
country’s cyber resources are controlled by
entities outside of government. For the National
Strategy to Secure Cyberspace to work it must be a
plan in which a broad cross section of the
country is both invested and committed.
Accordingly, the dialogue about how we secure
cyberspace will continue.

T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E 53

C O N C L U S I O N : T H E

The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace
identifies five national priorities that will help
us achieve this ambitious goal. These are: (1) a
national cyberspace security response system;
(2) a national cyberspace security threat and
vulnerability reduction program; (3) a national
cyberspace security awareness and training
program; (4) securing governments’ cyberspace;
and, (5) national security and international
cyberspace security cooperation. These five
priorities will serve to prevent, deter, and
protect against attacks. In addition, they also
create a process for minimizing the damage and
recovering from attacks that do occur.
The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace is,
however, only a first step in a long-term effort
to secure our information infrastructures. The
federal executive branch will use a variety of
tools to implement this Strategy. The
Administration will work with Congress to
craft future federal security budgets based on
the Strategy, providing every department and
agency involved in cybersecurity with resources
to execute its responsibilities. Each lead
department and agency will plan and program
to execute the initiatives assigned by the
National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace.
Within the federal government DHS will play a
central role in implementing the National
Strategy to Secure Cyberspace. In addition to
executing its assigned initiatives, the
Department would also serve as the primary
federal point-of-contact for state and local
governments, the private sector, and the
American people on issues related to cyberspace
security. Working with the White House, the

W A Y

F O R W A R D

Department therefore would coordinate and
support implementation of non-federal tasks
recommended in the National Strategy to Secure
Cyberspace.
Each department and agency will also be
accountable for its performance on cybersecurity efforts. The federal government will
employ performance measures—and encourage
the same for state and local governments—to
evaluate the effectiveness of the cybersecurity
programs outlined in this Strategy. These
performance measures will allow agencies to
measure their progress, make resource allocation
decisions, and adjust priorities accordingly.
Federal, state, and local governments, as well as
organizations and people all across the United
States will continue to work to improve cyberspace security. As these strategies and plans are
implemented, we will begin to incrementally
reduce threats and vulnerabilities.
Cybersecurity and personal privacy need not be
opposing goals. Cyberspace security programs
must strengthen, not weaken, such protections.
The federal government will continue to
regularly meet with privacy advocates to discuss
cybersecurity and the implementation of this
Strategy.
For the foreseeable future, two things will be
true: America will rely upon cyberspace and the
federal government will seek a continuing broad
partnership to develop, implement, and refine
the National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace.

Actions and Recommendations (A/R)
Summary
Priority I: A National Cyberspace
Security Response System
A/R 1-1: DHS will create a single point-ofcontact for the federal government’s interaction
with industry and other partners for 24 x7
functions, including cyberspace analysis,
warning, information sharing, major incident
response, and national-level recovery efforts.
Private sector organizations, which have major
contributions for those functions, are
encouraged to coordinate activities, as permitted
by law, in order to provide a synoptic view of
the health of cyberspace on a 24 x 7 basis.
A/R 1-2: As outlined in the 2003 budget, the
federal government will complete the installation of CWIN to key government
cybersecurity-related network operation centers,
to disseminate analysis and warning information and perform crisis coordination. The
federal government will also explore linking the
ISACs to CWIN.
A/R 1-3: To test civilian agencies’ security
preparedness and contingency planning, DHS
will use exercises to evaluate the impact of cyber
attacks on governmentwide processes.
Weaknesses discovered will be included in
agency corrective action plans and submitted to
the OMB. DHS also will explore such exercises
as a way to test the coordination of public and
private incident management, response and
recovery capabilities.
A/R 1-4: Corporations are encouraged to
regularly review and exercise IT continuity
plans and to consider diversity in IT service
providers as a way of mitigating risk.

A/R 1-5: Infrastructure sectors are encouraged
to establish mutual assistance programs for
cybersecurity emergencies. DoJ and the Federal
Trade Commission should work with the
sectors to address barriers to such cooperation,
as appropriate. In addition, DHS’s Information
Analysis and Infrastructure Protection
Directorate will coordinate the development
and regular update of voluntary joint
government-industry cybersecurity contingency
plans, including a plan for recovering Internet
functions.
A/R 1-6: DHS will raise awareness about the
removal of impediments to information sharing
about cybersecurity and infrastructure vulnerabilities between the public and private sectors.
The Department will also establish an infrastructure protection program office to manage
the information flow, including the development of protocols for how to care for
“voluntarily submitted critical infrastructure
information.”
A/R 1-7: Corporations are encouraged to
consider active involvement in industrywide
programs to share information on IT security,
including the potential benefits of joining an
appropriate ISAC. Colleges and universities are
encouraged to consider establishing: (1) one or
more ISACs to deal with cyber attacks and
vulnerabilities; and, (2) an on-call point-ofcontact to Internet service providers and law
enforcement officials in the event that the
school’s IT systems are discovered to be
launching cyber attacks.

Priority II: A National Cyberspace
Security Threat and Vulnerability
Reduction Program
A/R 2-1: DoJ and other appropriate agencies
will develop and implement efforts to reduce
cyber attacks and cyber threats through the
following means: (1) identifying ways to
improve information sharing and investigative
coordination within the federal, state, and local
law enforcement community working on critical
infrastructure and cyberspace security matters,
and with other agencies and the private sector;
(2) exploring means to provide sufficient investigative and forensic resources and training to
facilitate expeditious investigation and
resolution of critical infrastructure incidents;
and, (3) developing better data about victims of
cybercrime and intrusions in order to understand the scope of the problem and be able to
track changes over time.
A/R 2-2: DHS, in coordination with appropriate agencies and the private sector, will lead
in the development and conduct of a national
threat assessment including red teaming, blue
teaming, and other methods to identify the
impact of possible attacks on a variety of
targets.
A/R 2-3: The Department of Commerce will
form a task force to examine the issues related
to IPv6, including the appropriate role of
government, international interoperability,
security in transition, and costs and benefits.
The task force will solicit input from potentially
impacted industry segments.
A/R 2-4: DHS, in coordination with the
Commerce Department and appropriate
agencies, will coordinate public-private partnerships to encourage: (1) the adoption of
improved security protocols; (2) the development of more secure router technology; and,
(3) the adoption by ISPs of a “code of good
conduct,” including cybersecurity practices and
security related cooperation. DHS will support

these efforts as required for their success,
subject to other budget considerations.
A/R 2-5: DHS, in coordination with DOE and
other concerned agencies and in partnership
with industry, will develop best practices and
new technology to increase security of
DCS/SCADA, to determine the most critical
DCS/SCADA-related sites, and to develop a
prioritized plan for short-term cybersecurity
improvements in those sites.
A/R 2-6: DHS will work with the National
Infrastructure Advisory Council and private
sector organizations to develop an optimal
approach and mechanism for vulnerability
disclosure.
A/R 2-7: GSA will work with DHS on an
improved approach to implementing a patch
clearinghouse for the federal government. DHS
will also share lessons learned with the private
sector and encourage the development of a
voluntary, industry-led, national effort to
develop a similar clearinghouse for other sectors
including large enterprises.
A/R 2-8: The software industry is encouraged
to consider promoting more secure “out-of-thebox” installation and implementation of their
products, including increasing: (1) user
awareness of the security features in products;
(2) ease-of-use for security functions; and, (3)
where feasible, promotion of industry guidelines
and best practices that support such efforts.
A/R 2-9: DHS will establish and lead a publicprivate partnership to identify cross-sectoral
interdependencies both cyber and physical. The
partnership will develop plans to reduce related
vulnerabilities in conjunction with programs
proposed in the National Strategy for
Homeland Security. The National
Infrastructure Simulation and Analysis Center
in DHS will support these efforts by developing
models to identify the impact of cyber and
physical interdependencies.

A P P E N D I X

A/R 2-10: DHS also will support, when
requested and as appropriate, voluntary efforts
by owners and operators of information system
networks and network data centers to develop
remediation and contingency plans to reduce
the consequences of large-scale physical damage
to facilities supporting such networks, and to
develop appropriate procedures for limiting
access to critical facilities.
A/R 2-11: To meet these needs, the Director of
OSTP will coordinate the development, and
update on an annual basis a federal government
research and development agenda that includes
near-term (1-3 years), mid-term (3-5 years),
and later (5 years out and longer) IT security
research for Fiscal Year 2004 and beyond.
Existing priorities include, among others,
intrusion detection, Internet infrastructure
security (including protocols such as BGP and
DNS), application security, DoS, communications security (including SCADA system
encryption and authentication), high-assurance
systems, and secure system composition.
A/R 2-12: To optimize research efforts relative
to those of the private sector, DHS will ensure
that adequate mechanisms exist for coordination of research and development among
academia, industry and government, and will
develop new mechanisms where needed.
A/R 2-13: The private sector is encouraged to
consider including in near-term research and
development priorities, programs for highly
secure and trustworthy operating systems. If
such systems are developed and successfully
evaluated, the federal government will, subject
to budget considerations, accelerate
procurement of such systems.
A/R 2-14: DHS will facilitate a national
public-private effort to promulgate best
practices and methodologies that promote
integrity, security, and reliability in software
code development, including processes and
procedures that diminish the possibilities of

erroneous code, malicious code, or trap doors
that could be introduced during development.
A/R 2-15: DHS, in coordination with OSTP
and other agencies, as appropriate, will facilitate
communication between the public and private
research and the security communities, to
ensure that emerging technologies are periodically reviewed by the appropriate body within
the National Science and Technology Council,
in the context of possible homeland and cyberspace security implications, and relevance to the
federal research agenda.

Priority III: A National Cyberspace
Security Awareness and Training
Program
A/R 3-1: DHS, working in coordination with
appropriate federal, state, and local entities and
private sector organizations, will facilitate a
comprehensive awareness campaign including
audience-specific awareness materials,
expansion of the StaySafeOnline campaign, and
development of awards programs for those in
industry making significant contributions to
security.
A/R 3-2: DHS, in coordination with the
Department of Education, will encourage and
support, where appropriate subject to budget
considerations, state, local, and private organizations in the development of programs and
guidelines for primary and secondary school
students in cybersecurity.
A/R 3-3: Home users and small businesses can
help the Nation secure cyberspace by securing
their own connections to it. Installing firewall
software and updating it regularly, maintaining
current antivirus software, and regularly
updating operating systems and major applications with security enhancements are actions
that individuals and enterprise operators can
take to help secure cyberspace. To facilitate such
actions, DHS will create a public-private task
force of private companies, organizations, and
consumer users groups to identify ways that

T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E 57

A P P E N D I X

providers of information technology products
and services, and other organizations can make
it easier for home users and small businesses to
secure their systems.
A/R 3-4: Large enterprises are encouraged to
evaluate the security of their networks that
impact the security of the Nation’s critical infrastructures. Such evaluations might include: (1)
conducting audits to ensure effectiveness and
use of best practices; (2) developing continuity
plans which consider offsite staff and
equipment; and, (3) participating in industrywide information sharing and best practices
dissemination.
A/R 3-5: Colleges and universities are
encouraged to secure their cyber systems by
establishing some or all of the following as
appropriate: (1) one or more ISACs to deal
with cyber attacks and vulnerabilities; (2) model
guidelines empowering Chief Information
Officers (CIOs) to address cybersecurity; (3)
one or more sets of best practices for IT
security; and, (4) model user awareness
programs and materials.
A/R 3-6: A public-private partnership should
continue work in helping to secure the Nation’s
cyber infrastructure through participation in, as
appropriate and feasible, a technology and
R&D gap analysis to provide input into the
federal cybersecurity research agenda, coordination on the conduct of associated research,
and the development and dissemination of best
practices for cybersecurity.
A/R 3-7: DHS will implement and encourage
the establishment of programs to advance the
training of cybersecurity professionals in the
United States, including coordination with
NSF, OPM, and NSA, to identify ways to
leverage the existing Cyber Corps Scholarship
for Service program as well as the various
graduate, postdoctoral, senior researcher, and
faculty development fellowship and traineeship
programs created by the Cyber Security
Research and Development Act, to address

these important training and education
workforce issues.
A/R 3-8: DHS, in coordination with other
agencies with cybersecurity training expertise,
will develop a coordination mechanism linking
federal cybersecurity and computer forensics
training programs.
A/R 3-9: DHS will encourage efforts that are
needed to build foundations for the development of security certification programs that
will be broadly accepted by the public and
private sectors. DHS and other federal agencies
can aid these efforts by effectively articulating
the needs of the Federal IT security community.

Priority IV: Securing Governments’
Cyberspace
A/R 4-1: Federal agencies will continue to
expand the use of automated, enterprise-wide
security assessment and security policy
enforcement tools and actively deploy threat
management tools to deter attacks. The federal
government will determine whether specific
actions are necessary (e.g., through the policy or
budget processes) to promote the greater use of
these tools.
A/R 4-2: Through the ongoing EAuthentication initiative, the federal
government will review the need for stronger
access control and authentication; explore the
extent to which all departments can employ the
same physical and logical access control tools
and authentication mechanisms; and, consequently, further promote consistency and
interoperability.
A/R 4-3: Federal agencies should consider
installing systems that continuously check for
unauthorized connections to their networks.
Agency policy and procedures should reflect
careful consideration of additional risk
reduction measures, including the use of strong
encryption, bi-directional authentication,
shielding standards and other technical security

58 T H E N A T I O N A L S T R A T E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S P A C E

A P P E N D I X

considerations, configuration management,
intrusion detection, incident handling, and
computer security awareness and training
programs.
A/R 4-4: Additionally, the federal government
will be conducting a comprehensive review of
the National Information Assurance
Partnership (NIAP), to determine the extent to
which it is adequately addressing the continuing
problem of security flaws in commercial
software products. This review will include
lessons-learned from implementation of the
Defense Department’s July 2002 policy
requiring the acquisition of products reviewed
under the NIAP or similar evaluation processes.
A/R 4-5: The federal government will explore
whether private sector security service providers
to the federal government should be certified as
meeting certain minimum capabilities,
including the extent to which they are
adequately independent.
A/R 4-6: State and local governments are
encouraged to establish IT security programs
for their departments and agencies, including
awareness, audits, and standards; and to participate in the established ISACs with similar
governments.

Priority V: National Security and
International Cyberspace Security
Cooperation
A/R 5-1: The FBI and intelligence community
should ensure a strong counterintelligence
posture to counter cyber-based intelligence
collection against the U.S. Government, and
commercial and educational organizations. This
effort must include a deeper understanding of
the capability and intent of our adversaries to
use cyberspace as a means for espionage.
A/R 5-2: The intelligence community, DoD,
and the law enforcement agencies must improve
the Nation’s ability to quickly attribute the
source of threatening attacks or actions to

enable timely and effective response.
Consistent with the National Security Strategy,
these efforts will also seek to develop capabilities to prevent attacks from reaching critical
systems and infrastructures.
A/R 5-3: The United States must improve
interagency coordination between law
enforcement, national security, and defense
agencies involving cyber-based attacks and
espionage, ensuring that criminal matters are
referred, as appropriate, among those agencies.
The National Security Council and the Office
of Homeland Security will lead a study to
ensure that appropriate mechanisms are in
place.
A/R 5-4: When a nation, terrorist group, or
other adversary attacks the United States
through cyberspace, the U.S. response need not
be limited to criminal prosecution. The United
States reserves the right to respond in an appropriate manner. The United States will be
prepared for such contingencies.
A/R 5-5: The United States will work through
appropriate international organizations and in
partnership with industry to facilitate dialogue
between foreign public and private sectors on
information infrastructure protection and
promote a global “culture of security.”
A/R 5-6: The United States will work with
Canada and Mexico to make North America a
“Safe Cyber Zone.” We will expand programs
to identify and secure critical common networks
that underpin telecommunications, energy,
transportation, banking and finance systems,
emergency services, food, public health, and
water systems.
A/R 5-7: The United States will urge each
nation to build on the common Y2K experience
and appoint a centralized point-of-contact who
can act as a liaison between domestic and global
cybersecurity efforts. Establishing points of
contact can greatly enhance the international
coordination and resolution of cyberspace

T H E N AT I O N A L S T R AT E G Y T O S E C U R E C Y B E R S PA C E

59

A P P E N D I X

security issues. We will also encourage each
nation to develop its own watch-and-warning
network capable of informing government
agencies, the public, and other countries about
impending attacks or viruses.
A/R 5-8: To facilitate real-time sharing of the
threat information as it comes to light; the
United States will foster the establishment of an
international network capable of receiving,
assessing, and disseminating this information
globally. Such a network can build on the
capabilities of nongovernmental institutions
such as the Forum of Incident Response and
Security Teams.
A/R 5-9: The United States will encourage
regional organizations, such as the APEC,

EU, and OAS, to each form or designate a
committee responsible for cybersecurity. Such
committees would also benefit from establishing parallel working groups with
representatives from the private sector. The
United States will also encourage regional
organizations—such as the APEC, EU, and
OAS—to establish a joint committee on cybersecurity with representatives from government
and the private sector.
A/R 5-10: The United States will encourage
other nations to accede to the Council of
Europe Convention on Cybercrime or to ensure
that their laws and procedures are at least as
comprehensive.
