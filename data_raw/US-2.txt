Assuring a Trusted and Resilient Information
and Communications Infrastructure


Preface

Cyberspace touches practically everything and everyone. It provides a platform for innovation and
prosperity and the means to improve general welfare around the globe. But with the broad reach of
a loose and lightly regulated digital infrastructure, great risks threaten nations, private enterprises,
and individual rights. The government has a responsibility to address these strategic vulnerabilities
to ensure that the United States and its citizens, together with the larger community of nations, can
realize the full potential of the information technology revolution.
The architecture of the Nation’s digital infrastructure, based largely upon the Internet, is not secure or
resilient. Without major advances in the security of these systems or significant change in how they
are constructed or operated, it is doubtful that the United States can protect itself from the growing
threat of cybercrime and state-sponsored intrusions and operations. Our digital infrastructure has
already suffered intrusions that have allowed criminals to steal hundreds of millions of dollars and
nation-states and other entities to steal intellectual property and sensitive military information.
Other intrusions threaten to damage portions of our critical infrastructure. These and other risks
have the potential to undermine the Nation’s confidence in the information systems that underlie
our economic and national security interests.
The Federal government is not organized to address this growing problem effectively now or in the
future. Responsibilities for cybersecurity are distributed across a wide array of federal departments
and agencies, many with overlapping authorities, and none with sufficient decision authority to
direct actions that deal with often conflicting issues in a consistent way. The government needs
to integrate competing interests to derive a holistic vision and plan to address the cybersecurity­
related issues confronting the United States. The Nation needs to develop the policies, processes,
people, and technology required to mitigate cybersecurity-related risks.
Information and communications networks are largely owned and operated by the private sector,
both nationally and internationally. Thus, addressing network security issues requires a publicprivate partnership as well as international cooperation and norms. The United States needs a
comprehensive framework to ensure coordinated response and recovery by the government, the
private sector, and our allies to a significant incident or threat.
The United States needs to conduct a national dialogue on cybersecurity to develop more public
awareness of the threat and risks and to ensure an integrated approach toward the Nation’s need
for security and the national commitment to privacy rights and civil liberties guaranteed by the
Constitution and law.
Research on new approaches to achieving security and resiliency in information and communica­
tions infrastructures is insufficient. The government needs to increase investment in research that
will help address cybersecurity vulnerabilities while also meeting our economic needs and national
security requirements.

Executive Summary

The President directed a 60-day, comprehensive, “clean-slate” review to assess U.S. policies and
structures for cybersecurity. Cybersecurity policy includes strategy, policy, and standards regarding
the security of and operations in cyberspace, and encompasses the full range of threat reduction,
vulnerability reduction, deterrence, international engagement, incident response, resiliency, and
recovery policies and activities, including computer network operations, information assurance,
law enforcement, diplomacy, military, and intelligence missions as they relate to the security
and stability of the global information and communications infrastructure. The scope does not
include other information and communications policy unrelated to national security or securing
the infrastructure. The review team of government cybersecurity experts engaged and received
input from a broad cross-section of industry, academia, the civil liberties and privacy communities,
State governments, international partners, and the Legislative and Executive Branches. This paper
summarizes the review team’s conclusions and outlines the beginning of the way forward towards
a reliable, resilient, trustworthy digital infrastructure for the future.
The Nation is at a crossroads. The globally-interconnected digital information and communications
infrastructure known as “cyberspace”underpins almost every facet of modern society and provides
critical support for the U.S. economy, civil infrastructure, public safety, and national security. This
technology has transformed the global economy and connected people in ways never imagined.
Yet, cybersecurity risks pose some of the most serious economic and national security challenges
of the 21st Century. The digital infrastructure’s architecture was driven more by considerations of
interoperability and efficiency than of security. Consequently, a growing array of state and non-state
actors are compromising, stealing, changing, or destroying information and could cause critical dis­
ruptions to U.S. systems. At the same time, traditional telecommunications and Internet networks
continue to converge, and other infrastructure sectors are adopting the Internet as a primary means
of interconnectivity. The United States faces the dual challenge of maintaining an environment that
promotes efficiency, innovation, economic prosperity, and free trade while also promoting safety,
security, civil liberties, and privacy rights.1 It is the fundamental responsibility of our government
to address strategic vulnerabilities in cyberspace and ensure that the United States and the world
realize the full potential of the information technology revolution.
The status quo is no longer acceptable. The United States must signal to the world that it is serious
about addressing this challenge with strong leadership and vision. Leadership should be elevated
and strongly anchored within the White House to provide direction, coordinate action, and achieve
results. In addition, federal leadership and accountability for cybersecurity should be strengthened.
This approach requires clarifying the cybersecurity-related roles and responsibilities of federal
departments and agencies while providing the policy, legal structures, and necessary coordina­
tion to empower them to perform their missions. While efforts over the past two years started key
programs and made great strides by bridging previously disparate agency missions, they provide

an incomplete solution. Moreover, this issue transcends the jurisdictional purview of individual
departments and agencies because, although each agency has a unique contribution to make, no
single agency has a broad enough perspective or authority to match the sweep of the problem.
The national dialogue on cybersecurity must begin today. The government, working with industry,
should explain this challenge and discuss what the Nation can do to solve problems in a way that
the American people can appreciate the need for action. People cannot value security without first
understanding how much is at risk. Therefore, the Federal government should initiate a national
public awareness and education campaign informed by previous successful campaigns. Further,
similar to the period after the launch of the Sputnik satellite in October, 1957, the United States
is in a global race that depends on mathematics and science skills. While we continue to boast
the most positive environment for information technology firms in the world, the Nation should
develop a workforce of U.S. citizens necessary to compete on a global level and sustain that posi­
tion of leadership.
The United States cannot succeed in securing cyberspace if it works in isolation. The Federal govern­
ment should enhance its partnership with the private sector. The public and private sectors’interests
are intertwined with a shared responsibility for ensuring a secure, reliable infrastructure. There are
many ways in which the Federal government can work with the private sector, and these alternatives
should be explored. The public-private partnership for cybersecurity must evolve to define clearly
the nature of the relationship, including the roles and responsibilities of each of the partners.2,3,4 The
Federal government should examine existing public-private partnerships to optimize their capacity
to identify priorities and enable efficient execution of concrete actions.5,6,7
The Nation also needs a strategy for cybersecurity designed to shape the international environ­
ment and bring like-minded nations together on a host of issues, such as technical standards and
acceptable legal norms regarding territorial jurisdiction, sovereign responsibility, and use of force.
International norms are critical to establishing a secure and thriving digital infrastructure. In addi­
tion, differing national and regional laws and practices—such as laws concerning the investigation
and prosecution of cybercrime; data preservation, protection, and privacy; and approaches for net­
work defense and response to cyber attacks—present serious challenges to achieving a safe, secure,
and resilient digital environment. Only by working with international partners can the United States
best address these challenges, enhance cybersecurity, and reap the full benefits of the digital age.
The Federal government cannot entirely delegate or abrogate its role in securing the Nation from
a cyber incident or accident. The Federal government has the responsibility to protect and defend
the country, and all levels of government have the responsibility to ensure the safety and well­
being of citizens. The private sector, however, designs, builds, owns, and operates most of the
digital infrastructures that support government and private users alike. The United States needs a

comprehensive framework to ensure a coordinated response by the Federal, State, local, and tribal
governments, the private sector, and international allies to significant incidents. Implementation
of this framework will require developing reporting thresholds, adaptable response and recovery
plans, and the necessary coordination, information sharing, and incident reporting mechanisms
needed for those plans to succeed. The government, working with key stakeholders, should design
an effective mechanism to achieve a true common operating picture that integrates information
from the government and the private sector and serves as the basis for informed and prioritized
vulnerability mitigation efforts and incident response decisions.
Working with the private sector, performance and security objectives must be defined for the
next-generation infrastructure. The United States should harness the full benefits of technology
to address national economic needs and national security requirements. Federal policy should
address requirements for national security, protection of intellectual property, and the availability
and continuity of infrastructure, even when it is under attack by sophisticated adversaries. The
Federal government through partnerships with the private sector and academia needs to articulate
coordinated national information and communications infrastructure objectives. The government,
working with State and local partners, should identify procurement strategies that will incentivize
the market to make more secure products and services available to the public. Additional incentive
mechanisms that the government should explore include adjustments to liability considerations
(reduced liability in exchange for improved security or increased liability for the consequences of
poor security), indemnification, tax incentives, and new regulatory requirements and compliance
mechanisms.8,9
The White House must lead the way forward. The Nation’s approach to cybersecurity over the past
15 years has failed to keep pace with the threat. We need to demonstrate abroad and at home that
the United States takes cybersecurity-related issues, policies, and activities seriously. This requires
White House leadership that draws upon the strength, advice, and ideas of the entire Nation.
The review recommends the near-term actions listed in Table 1.

What is cyberspace?
National Security Presidential
Directive 54/Homeland
Security Presidential
Directive 23 (NSPD-54/HSPD­
23) defines cyberspace as
the interdependent network
of information technology
infrastructures, and includes
the Internet, telecommunications networks, computer
systems, and embedded
processors and controllers in
critical industries. Common
usage of the term also refers
to the virtual environment of
information and interactions
between people.

The globally-interconnected digital information and communications infrastructure known as “cyberspace” underpins almost
every facet of modern society and provides critical support for
the U.S. economy, civil infrastructure, public safety, and national
security. Information technology has transformed the global
economy and connected people and markets in ways never
imagined. To realize the full benefits of the digital revolution,
users must have confidence that sensitive information is secure,
commerce is not compromised, and the infrastructure is not
infiltrated. Nation-states also need confidence that the networks
that support their national security and economic prosperity are
safe and resilient. Achieving a trusted communications and infor­
mation infrastructure will ensure that the United States achieves
the full potential of the information technology revolution. The
December 2008 report by the Commission on Cybersecurity
for the 44th Presidency states the challenge plainly: “America’s
failure to protect cyberspace is one of the most urgent national
security problems facing the new administration.”10

Protecting cyberspace requires strong vision and leadership and will require changes in policies,
technologies, education, and perhaps laws. Demonstrating commitment to cybersecurity-related
issues at the highest levels of government, industry, and civil society will allow the United States to
continue to lead innovation and adoption of cutting-edge technology, while enhancing national
security and the global economy.

Case for Action
Threats to cyberspace pose one of the most serious economic and national security challenges of
the 21st Century for the United States and our allies. A growing array of state and non-state actors
such as terrorists and international criminal groups are targeting U.S. citizens, commerce, critical
infrastructure, and government. These actors have the ability to compromise, steal, change, or
completely destroy information.11 The continued exploitation of information networks and the
compromise of sensitive data, especially by nations, leave the United States vulnerable to the loss of
economic competitiveness and the loss of the military’s technological advantages. As the Director
of National Intelligence (DNI) recently testified before Congress, “the growing connectivity between
information systems, the Internet, and other infrastructures creates opportunities for attackers to
disrupt telecommunications, electrical power, energy pipelines, refineries, financial networks, and

other critical infrastructures.” The Intelligence Community assesses that a number of nations already
have the technical capability to conduct such attacks.12
The growing sophistication and breadth of criminal activity, along with the harm already caused
by cyber incidents, highlight the potential for malicious activity in cyberspace to affect U.S. com­
petitiveness, degrade privacy and civil liberties protections, undermine national security, or cause
a general erosion of trust, or even cripple society. For example:
•	 Failure of critical infrastructures. CIA reports malicious activities against information tech­
nology systems have caused the disruption of electric power capabilities in multiple regions
overseas, including a case that resulted in a multi-city power outage.13
•	 Exploiting global financial services. In November 2008, the compromised payment pro­
cessors of an international bank permitted fraudulent transactions at more than 130 auto ­
mated teller machines in 49 cities within a 30-minute period, according to press reports.14
In another case reported by the media, a U.S. retailer in 2007 experienced data breaches
and loss of personally identifiable information that compromised 45 million credit and
debit cards.15
•	 Systemic loss of U.S. economic value. Industry estimates of losses from intellectual property
to data theft in 2008 range as high as $1 trillion.16

Clean-Slate Review
Recognizing the challenges and opportunities, the President identified cybersecurity as one of the
top priorities of his administration and directed an early 60-day, comprehensive review to assess U.S.
policies and structures for cybersecurity. The review addressed all missions and activities associated
with the information and communications infrastructure, including computer network defense, law
enforcement investigations, military and intelligence activities, and the intersection thereof with
information assurance, counterintelligence, counterterrorism, telecommunications policies, and

cybersecurity policy as used in this document includes strategy, policy, and standards regarding the
security of and operations in cyberspace, and encompasses the full range of threat reduction, vulner­
ability reduction, deterrence, international engagement, incident response, resiliency, and recovery
policies and activities, including computer network operations, information assurance, law enforce­
ment, diplomacy, military, and intelligence missions as they relate to the security and stability of the
global information and communications infrastructure. The scope does not include other information
and communications policy unrelated to national security or securing the infrastructure.

general critical infrastructure protection. The review team of government cybersecurity experts
inventoried relevant presidential policy directives, executive orders, national strategies, and stud­
ies from government advisory boards and private-sector entities. The review team solicited input
from departments and agencies on their specific cybersecurity-related activities, authorities, and
capabilities across these requirements and requested departments and agencies to identify any
new or existing requirements that may not have been identified as part of the initial inventory.
Scores of legal issues emerged, such as considerations related to the aggregation of authorities,
what authorities are available for the government to protect privately owned critical infrastructure,
the placement of Internet monitoring software, the use of automated attack detection and warning
sensors, data sharing with third parties within the Federal government, and liability protections for
the private sector.
The review team reached out to a wide array of stakeholders inside and outside the Federal govern­
ment. The review team sought to be transparent by engaging a broad cross-section of industry,
academia, the civil liberties and privacy communities, State governments, international partners, and
the Legislative and Executive Branches to identify and assess other relevant programs and issues.
Recognizing that there are opportunities for everyone—academia, industry, and government—to
work together to build a trusted and resilient communications and information infrastructure, the
review team engaged these stakeholders about the scope of the reviews and asked for input on
pertinent areas of interest. The engagement process included more than 40 meetings and yielded
more than 100 papers that provided specific recommendations and goals. Stakeholders’responses
and public statements (e.g., Congressional testimony) helped to identify key requirements, illumi­
nate policy gaps, suggest areas of improvement or collaboration, and frame the decision space for
cybersecurity-related policies.
The review team found that throughout the evolution of the information and communications
infrastructure, missions and authorities were vested with various departments and agencies by laws
and policies enacted to govern aspects of what were then very diverse and discrete technologies
and industries. The programs that evolved from those missions were focused on the particular issue
or technology of the day and were not necessarily considered with the broad perspective needed
to match today’s sweeping digital dependence.
The impact of technology on national and economic security needs has led the Federal government
to adapt by creating new laws and organizations. For example:
•	 In a 1918 Joint Resolution, Congress authorized the President to assume control of any
telegraph system in the United States and operate it as needed for the duration of World
War I.
•	 The Communications Act of 1934 formed the Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
from the Federal Radio Commission and established a broad regulatory framework for all
communications, by wire and radio, that has influenced the development of these tech­
nologies ever since.

3


c y b Er S Pac E P o li c y r Ev i Ew

•	 The Brooks Act of 1965 gave the National Bureau of Standards (NBS)—now the Department
of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST)—responsibilities
for developing automatic data processing standards and guidelines pertaining to federal
computer systems.
•	 In 1984, Executive Order 12472 re-chartered the National Communication System (NCS) as
those telecommunication assets owned or leased by the Federal government that can meet
U.S. national security and emergency preparedness needs. The Department of Homeland
Security inherited the NCS in 2003.
•	 In 1994, through the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, the Department of State was
delegated authority over foreign policy related to international communication and infor­
mation policy.
Answering the question of“who is in charge”must address the distribution of statutory authorities
and missions across departments and agencies. This is particularly the case as telecommunications
and Internet-type networks converge and other infrastructure sectors adopt the Internet as a primary
means of interconnectivity. Unifying mission responsibilities that evolved over more than a century
will require the Federal government to clarify policies for cybersecurity and the cybersecurity-related
roles and responsibilities of various departments and agencies. The review team analyzed responses
from more than 20 federal departments and agencies and identified cybersecurity-related policy
gaps, overlaps in mission areas, and opportunities to improve collaboration.
As the threats have grown in sophistication, efforts to address the risks of cyberspace and harmonize
department and agency efforts have evolved over time as well. Presidential Decision Directive 63
(PDD-63), signed in May 1998, established a structure under White House leadership to coordinate
the activities of designated lead departments and agencies, in partnership with their counterparts
from the private sector, to “eliminate any significant vulnerability to both physical and cyber attacks
on our critical infrastructures, including especially our cyber systems.”17 This policy was updated in
2003 with The National Strategy to Secure Cyberspace. It was further augmented later that year in
Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7 (HSPD-7), which assigned the Secretary of Homeland
Security the responsibility for coordinating the nation’s overall critical infrastructure protection
efforts, including for cyber infrastructure, across all sectors working in cooperation with designated
sector-specific agencies within the Executive Branch.18 Both of these policies focused purely on
defensive strategies, and HSPD-7 did not encompass protection of Federal government informa­
tion systems. In 2007, the Comprehensive National Cybersecurity Initiative (CNCI) took a different
approach. Core to this strategy is the “bridging” of historically separate cyber defensive missions
with law enforcement, intelligence, counterintelligence, and military capabilities to address the full
spectrum of cyber threats from remote network intrusions and insider operations to supply chain
vulnerabilities. The CNCI strategy was codified in NSPD-54/HSPD-23 and initiated programs focused

primarily on the security of Executive Branch networks, which represent only a fraction of the global
information and communications infrastructure on which the United States depends.
This paper summarizes the review team’s findings and outlines initial areas of action to help the
United States achieve a more reliable, resilient, and trustworthy digital infrastructure for the future.
It does not provide an in-depth analysis of options or an extensive audit of programs. Instead, it
presents the need for greater coordination and integrated development of policy. The paper struc­
tures the specific findings and options for action under five key topics: (1) leading from the top, (2)
building capacity for a digital nation, (3) sharing responsibility for cybersecurity, (4) improving infor­
mation sharing and incident response, and (5) building the architecture of the future. In addition,
the paper is accompanied by appendices, including (A) a bibliography, (B) the study methodology,
and (C) a brief history of modern communications technology.

i. leading from the top

Ensuring that cyberspace is sufficiently resilient and trustworthy to support U.S. goals of economic
growth, civil liberties and privacy protections, national security, and the continued advancement of
democratic institutions requires making cybersecurity a national priority. Accomplishing this critical
and complex task will only be possible with leadership at the highest levels of government.

Anchor Leadership at the White House
Anchoring and elevating leadership for cybersecurity-related policies at the White House signals
to the United States and the international community that we are serious about cybersecurity.
Many departments and agencies as well as components of the Executive Office of the President
(EOP) will need to harmonize disparate responsibilities and authorities to contribute effectively to
cybersecurity. Currently, no single individual or entity has the responsibility to coordinate Federal
government cybersecurity-related activities. Independent efforts will not be sufficient to address
this challenge without a central coordination mechanism, an updated national strategy, an action
plan developed and coordinated across the Executive Branch, and the support of Congress.
The Administration already has established an Information and Communications Infrastructure
Interagency Policy Committee (ICI-IPC), chaired by the National Security Council (NSC) and Homeland
Security Council (HSC),19 as the primary policy coordination body for issues related to achieving an
assured, reliable, secure, and survivable global information and communications infrastructure and
related capabilities.
The President should consider appointing a cybersecurity policy official at the White House, report­
ing to the NSC and dual-hatted with the NEC, to coordinate the Nation’s cybersecurity-related
policies and activities. This individual would chair the ICI-IPC and lead a strong process in consulta­
tion with other elements of the EOP to resolve competing priorities and coordinate interagency
development of policies and strategies for cybersecurity.20 The cybersecurity policy official should
participate in all appropriate economic, counterterrorism, and science and technology policy dis­
cussions to inform them of cybersecurity perspectives.21,22
To be successful, the President’s cybersecurity policy official must have clear presidential support,
authority, and sufficient resources to operate effectively in policy formulation and the coordination
of interagency cybersecurity-related activities. The cybersecurity policy official should be supported
by at least two Senior Directors and appropriate staff from the NSC and at least one Senior Director
and appropriate staff from the NEC. These directorates would report through the cybersecurity
policy official and work together in pursuit of the goals set forth in this paper and established as
national policy. In addition, to achieve additional scale and integration across the NSC, each NSC

regional and functional directorate should designate an individual to be responsible for following
cybersecurity-related issues in the directorate’s portfolio and coordinating with the directorate for
cybersecurity.
The cybersecurity policy official should not have operational responsibility or authority, nor the
authority to make policy unilaterally. Using interagency coordination processes, the cybersecurity
policy official should harmonize cybersecurity-related policy and technology efforts across the
Federal government, ensure that the President’s budget reflects federal priorities for cyberse­
curity, and develop a legislative agenda, all in consultation with the Federal government’s Chief
Technology Officer and Chief Information Officer—along with the appropriate entities within the
Office of Management and Budget (OMB), the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP), and
the NEC. 23
This appointment also would make crisis management more effective by establishing the cyberse­
curity policy official as the White House action officer for cyber incident response (a similar role to
the action officers who help the White House monitor terrorist attacks or natural disasters); depart­
ments and agencies would continue to perform their operational roles.
To facilitate coordination, all federal departments and agencies should establish a point-of-contact
in their respective executive suites authorized to interface with the White House on cybersecurity­
related issues.
The cybersecurity policy official—through the interagency policy development process—should
prepare for the President’s consideration an updated national strategy to secure the information
and communications infrastructure. The strategy should include continued evaluation of CNCI
activities and build, where appropriate, on its successes.24 The national strategy should focus
senior leadership attention and time toward resolving issues that hamper U.S. efforts to achieve an
assured, reliable, secure, and resilient global information and communications infrastructure and
related capabilities.25 The strategy would assist government efforts to raise public awareness, renew
and build international alliances and public-private partnerships, establish a more comprehensive
national cyber response and recovery plan, and promote an aggressive research and development
agenda that has the potential to result in new technologies that will enhance cybersecurity.
The Federal government should continue the principle of “mission bridging” started under the
CNCI. Departments and agencies should expand the sharing of expertise, knowledge, and per­
spectives about threats, tradecraft, technology, and vulnerabilities between network defenders
and the intelligence, military, and law enforcement organizations that develop U.S. operational
capabilities in cyberspace. In addition, the cybersecurity policy official should help coordinate
intelligence and military policies and strategies for cyberspace—including for countering terrorist
use of the Internet—to ensure integration of all mission equities.The cybersecurity policy official
should engage external advisory bodies. Many advisory bodies touch on cybersecurity-related

National Infrastructure Advisory Council (NIAC), the Critical Infrastructure Partnership Advisory
Council (CIPAC), and the Information Security and Privacy Advisory Board (ISPAB). The cybersecurity
policy official should review the responsibilities of these bodies and propose changes as necessary
to optimize advice and eliminate unnecessary duplication.
Other structures will be needed to help ensure that civil liberties and privacy rights are protected.
Such structures would signal transparency and build trust between the civil liberties and privacy
community, the public, and the program for cybersecurity, especially if implemented from the
outset.26 It is important to reconstitute the Privacy and Civil Liberties Oversight Board (PCLOB),
accelerate the selection process for its board members, and consider whether to seek legislative
amendments to broaden its scope to include cybersecurity-related issues.27 Other options include:
facilitating regular engagement of government civil liberties and privacy advisors on policy matters
for cybersecurity or designating a dedicated privacy and civil liberties officer within the NSC (or,
more broadly, the EOP) to engage with the private-sector civil liberties and privacy community, an
oversight board, and government civil liberties and privacy officers.28, 29
Equally important to developing cybersecurity policy, is assuring the effective execution and imple­
mentation of that policy to meet the goals of the larger strategy. Accordingly, the cybersecurity
policy official, in consultation with OMB and other EOP entities, will need to ensure effective imple­
mentation of cybersecurity-related policy and activities. During the course of the 60-day review,
stakeholders suggested a variety of options to coordinate and oversee cybersecurity activities.
Several commentators identified strong executive leadership as well as focused, multi-year atten­
tion across the participating departments and agencies as critical elements to ensure that the U.S.
Government has the mechanisms needed for an effective cybersecurity program. Currently, some
of these oversight functions for existing cybersecurity efforts are being performed outside of the
EOP. For example, the Joint Interagency Cyber Task Force (JIACTF), under the Director of National
Intelligence, currently is responsible for coordinating and monitoring the implementation of the
CNCI. The cybersecurity policy official, in consultation with OMB and other EOP entities, should
develop structural options to perform appropriate oversight, implementation, and other functions.
These could include among others, developing a JIACTF-like function30 in OMB or elsewhere in the
EOP, creating an entity similar to President Eisenhower’s Operations Coordinating Board,31 or estab­
lishing some other entity that, among other things, assists in assessing department and agency
performance and oversees federal compliance with cybersecurity standards. Unless and until such
an office is established, the work of the JIACTF should continue.32

Review Laws and Policies
The President’s cybersecurity policy official should work with departments and agencies to recom­
mend coherent unified policy guidance where necessary in order to clarify authorities, roles, and
responsibilities for cybersecurity-related activities across the Federal government. Law applicable
to information and communications networks is a complex patchwork of Constitutional, domestic,
foreign, and international laws that shapes viable policy options. In the United States, this patchwork
exists because, throughout the evolution of the information and communications infrastructure,
the Federal government enacted laws and policies to govern aspects of what were very diverse
industries and technologies.
As traditional telecommunications and Internet-type networks continue to converge and other
infrastructure sectors adopt the Internet as a primary means of interconnectivity, law and policy
should continue to seek an integrated approach that combines the benefits of flexibility and diver­
sity of applications and services with the protection of civil liberties, privacy rights, public safety,
and national and economic security interests. A paucity of judicial opinions in several areas poses
both opportunities and risks that policy makers should appreciate—courts can intervene to shape
the application of law, particularly in areas involving Constitutional rights. Policy decisions will
necessarily be shaped and bounded by the legal framework in which they are made, and policy
consideration may help identify gaps and challenges in current laws and inform necessary develop­
ments in the law. That process may prompt proposals for a new legislative framework to rationalize
the patchwork of overlapping laws that apply to information, telecommunications, networks, and
technologies, or the application of new interpretations of existing laws in ways to meet technological
evolution and policy goals, consistent with U.S. Constitutional principles. However, pursuing either
course risks outcomes that may make certain activities conducted by the Federal government to
protect information and communications infrastructure more difficult.
The Administration should partner appropriately with Congress to ensure adequate law, poli­
cies, and resources are available to support the U.S. cybersecurity-related missions. Congress has
demonstrated interest and bipartisan leadership regarding the cybersecurity-related needs of the
Nation, and the Administration would benefit from Congressional knowledge and experience. The
cybersecurity policy official, working with departments and agencies, should consult with industry
to understand the impact of laws and policies on business operations.

Strengthen Federal Leadership and Accountability for Cybersecurity
Effective leadership anchored at the White House alone will not be sufficient to achieve the broad
range of objectives necessary to lead the United States in the digital age. Leadership and account­
ability must extend throughout the Federal government. Including cybersecurity among the
President’s management priorities and assessing the progress of departments and agencies against
stated goals would provide additional means to ensure accountability and progress. The cyberse­
curity policy official—in consultation with NSC, OMB, NEC, and OSTP—would define the milestones
and success criteria and raise the visibility of cybersecurity within all agency budgets.

10


i.

lE a d i n g f ro m t h E to P

To bring transparency and effective management to the overall portfolio for cybersecurity, OMB
should use its program assessment framework to ensure departments and agencies use perfor­
mance-based budgeting in pursuing cybersecurity-related goals. A formal program assessment
framework for cybersecurity would have departments and agencies define each program’s purpose
and goal as well as identify metrics to evaluate whether goals are achieved.33 The CNCI has used a
variation on this approach successfully.
Department and agency leaders must be held accountable, as required by the Federal Information
Security Management Act (FISMA) of 2002. The Administration should work with Congress to update
and strengthen this legislation. Performance plans of the department and agency leadership should
include reporting on progress made to secure systems by each department and agency. The Federal
government should develop options to hold department and agency leadership accountable for
compliance with cybersecurity policies and to enforce implementation of appropriate cybersecurity
procedures.

Elevate State, Local, and Tribal Leadership
State, local, and tribal governments should consider the need to elevate cybersecurity as an issue
by designating a single leader to ensure effective coordination between Chief Information Officers
(CIOs), Chief Information Security Officers (CISOs), and State Homeland Security Advisors (HSAs). The
review team heard from representatives of the National Governors Association that cybersecurity
is the weakest link in their efforts to protect critical infrastructure assets in their individual states. 34,35
HSAs can spend funds under a number of Department of Homeland Security (DHS) grant programs
for cybersecurity efforts, but historically grant funds to a large extent have not been prioritized for
cybersecurity. State, local, and tribal governments should consider whether to elevate cybersecurity
as an issue and should ensure that CIOs, CISOs, and HSAs coordinate to achieve a robust defensive
posture.

ii. building capacity for a digital nation

The Nation is at a crossroads. Computers have transformed nearly every aspect of daily life, both
at home and in the workplace. Online banking, shopping, and tax-filing are commonplace. The
Nation’s infrastructure is undergoing a revolution as digital and network technologies are being
integrated across large systems with programs such as Smart Grid and the Next Generation Air Traffic
System. Components of the recently enacted American Recovery and Reinvestment Act encourage
the deployment of modern information and communications infrastructure to improve America’s
competitiveness and use technology to solve some of the Nation’s most pressing problems. The
United States faces the dual challenge of maintaining an environment that promotes innovation,
open interconnectivity, economic prosperity, free trade, and freedom while also ensuring public
safety, security, civil liberties, and privacy.
The general public needs to be well informed to use the technology safely. In addition, the United
States needs a technologically advanced workforce to remain competitive in the 21st Century
economy. In schools, math and science must be a priority. The United States should initiate a K-12
cybersecurity education program for digital safety, ethics, and security; expand university curricula;
and set the conditions to create a competent workforce for the digital age. As the President has
noted, “America faces few more urgent challenges than preparing our children to compete in a
global economy.”36 To help achieve these goals, the Nation should:
•	 Promote cybersecurity risk awareness for all citizens;37,38
•	 Build an education system that will enhance understanding of cybersecurity and allow the
United States to retain and expand upon its scientific, engineering, and market leadership
in information technology;
•	 Expand and train the workforce to protect the Nation’s competitive advantage; and
•	 Help organizations and individuals make smart choices as they manage risk.

Increase Public Awareness
Broad public awareness of the risks of online activities and how to manage them will require an
effective communications strategy. The Federal government, in partnership with educators and
industry, should conduct a national cybersecurity public awareness and education.39 The President’s
cybersecurity policy official should lead the development and direct the implementation of this
public awareness strategy and should seek endorsement by Congress; State, local, and tribal gov­
ernments; the private sector; and the civil liberties and privacy communities. The strategy should

involve public education about the threat and how to enhance digital safety, ethics, and security.
Malicious actors often take advantage of people’s willingness to accept information from or pro­
vide personal information over the Internet. This campaign should focus on public messages to
promote responsible use of the Internet and awareness of fraud, identity theft, cyber predators,
and cyber ethics. Past successful public safety campaigns such as Smokey Bear on fire safety and
the Click It or Ticket campaign for seat belt safety could be used as a model to inform and persuade
the public about the importance of cybersecurity. These public service campaigns should focus on
making cybersecurity popular for children and for older students choosing careers. Celebrities, the
generation that has grown up with the technology, and new types of media can play critical roles
in delivering the message effectively.

Increase Cybersecurity Education
Similar to the period after the launch of the Sputnik satellite in October, 1957, the United States is in
a global race that depends on mathematics and science skills. According to a report published by
The Economist, talented information technology (IT) employees “are already in short supply every­
where, but the situation will get tougher, as the nature of skills needed is changing. In addition to
technical knowledge, tomorrow’s IT employee will require expertise in project management, change
management and business analysis.” The study notes that the United States continues to boast the
most positive environment for IT firms in the world, combining scale and quality in the key areas
that promote competitiveness: education, infrastructure, encouragement of innovation, and legal
protection.40 The 2007-2008 Taulbee Survey on Computing Degree and Enrollment Trends, however,
showed a continued decline in U.S. computer science and engineering bachelor’s degree production
to about half of its 2004 peak.41 The Nation cannot afford to see this decline continue.42
The Federal government, with the participation of all departments and agencies, should expand
support for key education programs and research and development to ensure the Nation’s contin­
ued ability to compete in the information age economy. Existing programs should be evaluated
and possibly expanded, and other activities could serve as models for additional programs. For
example:
•	 The National Science Foundation (NSF) in 2006 began to solicit grant proposals under its
“Pathways to Revitalized Undergraduate Computing Education.” This program seeks to
develop a “U.S. workforce with the computing competencies and skills imperative to the
Nation’s health, security and prosperity in the 21st Century.”43
•	 Scholarships have provided direct incentives for students to pursue not only cybersecurity
education, but also careers in the Federal government. NSF and DHS sponsor the Scholarship
for Service program in 34 institutions.44 More than a thousand students received support

during the first eight years of the program, with more than 80 percent receiving jobs in the
Federal government. The NSF stresses that the proven synergy between research and educa­
tion cannot be over-emphasized in light of the pressing need to expand the workforce.45
•	 The National Centers of Academic Excellence in Information Assurance Education and
Research, founded in 1988 by the National Security Agency and co-sponsored by DHS since
2004, promotes higher education in information assurance in 94 institutions in 38 States
and the District of Columbia.46 These centers have built partnerships beyond the most
well-known institutions to include community, Hispanic, and historically Black colleges.
The Defense Department also sponsors the Information Assurance Scholarship Program
in those institutions.
•	 The National Collegiate Cyber Defense Competition, the Mathematical Association of
America’s Math Olympiad, the Department of Energy’s Science Bowl, and the Siemens
Foundation’s Math, Science, and Technology Competition offer competition-oriented mod­
els. A group of academics organized by NSF cited DARPA’s grand challenges, the Malcolm
Baldrige National Quality Award, and the competition to create the Advanced Encryption
Standard as other models.47

Expand Federal Information Technology Workforce
The President’s cybersecurity policy official, in coordination with the ICI-IPC, should consider how
to better attract cybersecurity expertise and to increase retention of employees with such expertise
within the federal service. Departments and agencies have had success attracting new employees
from industry, but the time required to obtain, transfer, or renew security clearances leads to lost
opportunities. Federal employees need to be able to build portfolios and advance careers in ways
they might not be able to do within a single agency. Shared training and rotational assignments
across agencies and potentially with the private sector would not only be efficient, but would pro­
mote beneficial cross-fertilization and the building of professional networks.

Promote Cybersecurity as an Enterprise Leadership Responsibility
The Federal government should continue to facilitate programs and information sharing on threats,
vulnerabilities, and effective practices across all levels of government and industry. It is not enough
for the information technology workforce to understand the importance of cybersecurity; leaders
at all levels of government and industry need to be able to make business and investment deci­
sions based on knowledge of risks and potential impacts. State, local, and tribal governments face
similar issues. State governments often serve as incubators for innovation and thus may be able to
provide lessons learned in managing information and communications infrastructure. The Federal
government should continue to work with industry to identify and disseminate effective practices
in secure design and operation of information technology products.

iii. Sharing responsibility for 

cybersecurity

The Federal government cannot succeed in the many facets of securing cyberspace if it works in
isolation. The public and private sectors’ interests are intertwined with a shared responsibility for
ensuring a secure, reliable infrastructure upon which businesses and government services depend.
Government and industry leaders—both nationally and internationally—need to delineate roles and
responsibilities, integrate capabilities, and take ownership of the problem to develop holistic solu­
tions. Only through such partnerships will the United States be able to enhance cybersecurity and
reap the full benefits of the digital revolution. The global challenge of securing cyberspace requires
an increased effort in multilateral forums. This effort should seek—in continued collaboration with
the private sector—to improve the security of interoperable networks through the development of
global standards, expand the legal system’s capacity to combat cyber crime, continue to develop
and promote best practices, and maintain stable and effective Internet governance.

Improve Partnership Between Private Sector and Government
The Federal government has the responsibility to protect and defend the country, and all levels of
government have the responsibility to ensure the safety and well-being of their citizens. The pri­
vate sector, however, designs, builds, owns, and operates most of the network infrastructures that
support government and private users alike. Industry and governments share the responsibility
for the security and reliability of the infrastructure and the transactions that take place on it and
should work closely together to address these interdependencies. There are various approaches the
Federal government could take to address these challenges, some of which may require changes
in law and policy.
Private-sector engagement is required to help address the limitations of law enforcement and
national security. Current law permits the use of some tools to protect government but not private
networks, and vice versa. Industry leaders can help by engaging in enterprise information shar­
ing and account for the corporate risk and the bottom line impacts of data breaches, corporate
espionage, and loss or degradation of services. Industry leaders can demand higher assurance
from vendors and service providers while taking responsibility to create more secure software
and equipment. Businesses need effective means to share detection methods, information about
breaches and attack methods, remediation techniques, and forensic capabilities with each other
and the Federal government.
If the risks and consequences can be assigned monetary value, organizations will have greater ability
and incentive to address cybersecurity. In particular, the private sector often seeks a business case to
justify the resource expenditures needed for integrating information and communications system
security into corporate risk management and for engaging partnerships to mitigate collective risk.
Government can assist by considering incentive-based legislative or regulatory tools to enhance

17


c y b Er S Pac E P o li c y r Ev i Ew

the value proposition and fostering an environment that facilitates and encourages partnership
and information sharing.48, 49, 50
The President’s cybersecurity policy official should work with relevant departments and agencies
and the private sector to examine existing public-private partnership and information sharing
mechanisms to identify or build upon the most effective models. Public-private partnerships have
fostered information sharing and served as a foundation for U.S. critical infrastructure protection and
cybersecurity policy for over a decade. During that time, the Federal government and the private
sector have engaged in a number of forums on cybersecurity and information and communications
infrastructure issues.51
These groups perform valuable work, but the diffusion of effort has left some participants frustrated
with unclear delineation of roles and responsibilities, uneven capabilities across various groups, and
a proliferation of plans and recommendations. As a result, government and private-sector person­
nel, time, and resources are spread across a host of bodies engaged in sometimes duplicative or
inconsistent efforts. Partnerships must evolve to clearly define the nature of the relationship, the
roles and responsibilities of various groups and their participants, the expectations of each party’s
contribution, and accountability mechanisms. The Federal government should streamline, align, and
provide resources to existing organizations to optimize their capacity to identify priorities, enable
more efficient execution, and develop response and recovery plans.
The 60-day review considered a number of models of effective public-private partnerships.52 While
these models perform very different functions, they share important attributes. Each has a clearly
defined institutional mission, well-defined roles and responsibilities for participants, and a clear
value proposition that creates incentives for members to participate. Each model also mitigates
concerns that would otherwise discourage participation by establishing and maintaining an envi­
ronment of trust among the members. Existing cybersecurity partnership bodies might apply the
most effective characteristics of these models.

Evaluate Potential Barriers Impeding Evolution of Public-Private
Partnership
Some members of the private sector continue to express concern that certain federal laws might
impede full collaborative partnerships and operational information sharing between the private
sector and government. For example, some in industry are concerned that the information sharing
and collective planning that occurs among members of the same sector under existing partnership

models might be viewed as “collusive”or contrary to laws forbidding restraints on trade.53 Industry
has also expressed reservations about disclosing to the Federal government sensitive or proprietary
business information, such as vulnerabilities and data or network breaches. This concern has per­
sisted notwithstanding the protections afforded by statutes such as the Trade Secrets Act and the
Critical Infrastructure Information Act, which was enacted specifically to address industry concerns
with respect to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA). Beyond these issues, industry may still have
concerns about reputational harm, liability, or regulatory consequences of sharing information.
Conversely, the Federal government sometimes limits the information it will share with the private
sector because of the legitimate need to protect sensitive intelligence sources and methods or the
privacy rights of individuals.
These concerns do not exist in isolation. Antitrust laws provide important safeguards against unfair
competition, and FOIA helps ensure transparency in government that is essential to maintain public
confidence. The civil liberties and privacy community has expressed concern that extending protec­
tions would only serve as a legal shield against liability. In addition, the challenges of information
sharing can be further complicated by the global nature of the information and communications
marketplace. When members of industry operating in the United States are foreign-owned, man­
datory information sharing, or exclusion of such companies from information sharing regimes, can
present trade implications.
As part of the partnership, government should work creatively and collaboratively with the private
sector to identify tailored solutions that take into account both the need to exchange information
and protect public and private interests and take an integrated approach to national and economic
security. These solutions should identify clear, actionable objectives for the sharing of data and
define standards for incident reporting. The private sector would be more comfortable with shar­
ing solutions that do not require data ownership changing hands, such as occurs with the British
model of using vetted information security providers as a nexus for combining data rather than
the government.
Finally, the Federal government should engage academia, civil liberties and privacy groups, advo­
cates of open government, and consumers to ensure that government policy adequately considers
the broad set of interests that they represent. Few problems can be reduced to a discrete question
of process, policy, or technology. Changes in technology often precipitate policy considerations and
may require changes in existing processes. Changes in policy (for example, adoption of regulation
or tax incentives) can affect decisions regarding procurement or technological research and devel­
opment. The Federal government could also consider ways in which it could focus more resources
on research into possible “game-changing” areas, such as behavioral, policy, and incentive-based
cybersecurity solutions. The interwoven nature of these issues underscores the need to ensure that
all stakeholders’interests are represented.

Partner Effectively With the International Community
International norms are critical to establishing a secure and thriving digital infrastructure. The
United States needs to develop a strategy designed to shape the international environment and
bring like-minded nations together on a host of issues, including acceptable norms regarding ter­
ritorial jurisdiction, sovereign responsibility, and use of force. In addition, differing national and
regional laws and practices—such as those laws concerning the investigation and prosecution of
cybercrime;54 data preservation, protection and privacy; and approaches for network defense and
response to cyber attacks—present serious challenges to achieving a safe, secure, and resilient
digital environment. Addressing these issues requires the United States to work with all countries—
including those in the developing world who face these issues as they build their digital economies
and infrastructures—plus international bodies, military allies, and intelligence partners.
In the past decade, federal communications, infrastructure, and cybersecurity-related policies devel­
oped along multiple paths. A more integrated approach to policy formulation would ensure mutu­
ally reinforcing objectives and allow the United States to leverage its international opportunities
with consistent, more effective positions. The United States should adopt an integrated approach
to national interests across a range of substantive areas—including cybersecurity and the protec­
tion of free speech and other civil liberties—to develop consistent policies.
The President’s cybersecurity policy official should, working with departments and agencies,
strengthen and integrate interagency processes to formulate and coordinate international cyber­
security-related positions. In addition, the Federal government—continuing the long-term his­
tory of collaboration with the private sector—should develop a proactive engagement plan for
use with international standards bodies. This would include taking stock of current policies and
coordinating the development, refinement, or reaffirmation of positions to ensure that the full
range of cybersecurity-related economic, national security, public safety, and privacy interests
are taken into account.55 More than a dozen international organizations—including the United
Nations, the Group of Eight, NATO, the Council of Europe, the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation
forum, the Organization of American States, the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development, the InternationalTelecommunication Union (ITU), and the International Organization
for Standardization (ISO)—address issues concerning the information and communications infra­
structure.56 New organizations are beginning to consider cybersecurity-related policies and activities,
while others are expanding the scope of their existing work. These venues consider policies and
conduct activities that sometimes conflict and often overlap. Agreements, standards, or practices
promulgated in these organizations have global effects and cannot be ignored. The sheer number,
variety, and differing focuses of these venues strain the capacity of many governments, including
the United States, to engage adequately.

54
For example, the Council of Europe Convention on Cybercrime is an important international effort to achieve consistency in cyber-

crime laws and law enforcement efforts. Although the United States and many developed countries are parties to this agreement, most 

countries are not signatories or have not ratified the treaty.

The President’s cybersecurity policy official should work with departments and agencies to enhance
the identification, tracking, and prioritization of international venues, negotiations, and discussions
where cybersecurity-related agreements, standards, activities, and policies are being developed.
Past experience indicates the United States will need to remain engaged in a range of international
activities. The Federal government should then increase its work with the private sector and other
countries to ensure full engagement in appropriate forums with respect to the issues that are most
important to U.S. interests in the future of the global information and communications infrastructure.
The United States and its international allies should leverage each other’s participation in regional
or other forums to drive common policy objectives, focus the work of existing international orga­
nizations, and limit duplication of effort among them. For example, standards for cybersecurity
forensics are being developed in both the ITU and the ISO. The United States also should identify
opportunities to promote the security and growth of the information and communications infra­
structure in projects undertaken in forums devoted to broader topics.
Working with the private sector, the Federal government should coordinate and expand international
partnerships to address the full range of cybersecurity-related activities, policies, and opportunities
associated with the information and communications infrastructure upon which U.S. businesses,
government services, the U.S. military, and nations depend. New agreements between govern­
ments and industry may need to be documented to enable international information sharing as
well as strategic and operational collaboration. The Federal government should increase resources
and attention dedicated to conducting outreach and building foreign capacity. For example, the
United States should accelerate efforts to help other countries build legal frameworks and capac­
ity to fight cybercrime and continue efforts to promote cybersecurity practices and standards. The
United States also should work with allies to ensure the stability and global interoperability of the
Internet, while increasing security and reliability for all users.57

and incident response

The United States needs a comprehensive framework to facilitate coordinated responses by gov­
ernment, the private sector, and allies to a significant cyber incident. Federal, State, local, and tribal
governments should work with industry to improve the plans and resources they have in place
in advance to detect, prevent, and respond to significant cybersecurity incidents. Because such
incidents are likely to affect interconnected networks across government and industry sectors,
coordination of such plans and activities is important before, during, and after significant incidents.
For example, despite advance warning and instructions on how networks could be protected, had
the “Conficker”worm activated on April 1, 2009 with a malicious payload, some federal departments
and agencies were not prepared to respond.

Build a Framework for Incident Response
During a significant cyber incident, as with other major national incidents, only the White House
has the authority to coordinate the wide array of capabilities and authorities involved in incident
response. Departments and agencies conduct their relevant mission responsibilities in line with
overall White House strategic direction. The President’s cybersecurity policy official should be the
White House action officer for cyber incident response (a similar role to the action officers who help
the White House monitor terrorist attacks or natural disasters).
The Federal government should have a clear and authoritative cyber incident response frame­
work that needs to be documented in a revised Cyber Incident Annex for the National Response
Framework. To date, federal responses to cyber incidents have not been unified. For situations
involving National Security/Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP) communications, Executive Order
12472 delineates established authorities and processes; however, under current law and policy,
each department and agency is responsible for deciding on and implementing measures to isolate,
secure, and restore its own cyber networks and data.
Responsibility for a federal cyber incident response is dispersed across many federal departments
and agencies because of the existing legal, but artificial, distinctions between national security and
other federal networks. Depending on the character of an incident—for example, a major vulner­
ability, a criminal attack, or a military incident—different departments or agencies may have or
share the lead role for response, while others may never learn of the event. Moreover, the lead for
the overall incident may not be clear. Although each player has defined areas of expertise and legal
authorities, they are difficult to pull together into a single coordinated structure. Any consolidation
of authorities in a unified structure may require legislation. The ICI-IPC process should define roles,
responsibilities, and resources for different departments and agencies with respect to incident
response—harmonized or enhanced as necessary—recognizing the different aspects of incident
response and the different strengths various communities—network security, law enforcement,
intelligence, and military—bring to the table.

Numerous commentators have stressed the
importance of developing thresholds for incident
reporting and response. Network operators and
service providers deal daily with large numbers of
incidents that do not rise beyond the “nuisance”
level. Hidden among these low-level incidents
are a relatively few sophisticated, potentially highimpact intrusions or attacks that are difficult to
detect. Knowledge of the technical details of such
incidents would be of great interest to operators
of other government and private-sector networks
to help them defend their own networks against
similar threats, as well as to law enforcement and
intelligence entities tracking and seeking to stop
criminal and foreign cybersecurity-related threat
activities.

Network operators and Service Providers
The Internet is operated by a combination of
businesses that manage operations and pro­
vide services for their customers. Network
operators build and maintain information
and communications infrastructure in order
to provide connectivity and bandwidth for
customers. Service providers may provide
an access gateway to the Internet, security
services, storage or processing services, or
access to information (for example, Internet
addresses or news) and applications (for
example, search engines). Individual
companies may provide a unique mixture
of access, information, and services (for
example, social networks).

The Federal government—in collaboration with State, local, and tribal governments and industry—
should develop a set of threat scenarios and metrics that all can use for risk management decisions,
recovery planning, and prioritization of R&D. Modeling and simulation capabilities should be devel­
oped to help exercise these plans and determine potential levels of damage.
The ICI-IPC should develop clear, enforceable rules for timely reporting of incidents by departments
and agencies to enable an effective and efficient interagency response. Departments and agencies
are uneven in their incident reporting outside their own boundaries. The overall federal response
would benefit from immediate reporting of significant events across a wider range of departments
and agencies having incident response roles.
The President’s cybersecurity policy official, working with the ICI-IPC, should determine the most
efficient and effective method of developing and maintaining situational awareness and incident
response capabilities. The CNCI effort should continue to improve federal network defenses but con­
sider the need for adjustments or additions to implementation plans. In particular, the President’s
cybersecurity policy official should:
•	 Work with the private sector to explore how best to apply technical capabilities to the
defense of the national infrastructure and what legal framework would be required to
ensure the protection of privacy rights and civil liberties.
•	 Review the operational concept and the implementation of the National Cybersecurity
Center (NCSC) to determine whether its proposed responsibilities, resource strategy, and
governance are adequate to enable it to provide the shared situational awareness necessary
to support cyber incident response efforts.
•	 Continue to pursue the goal of the Trusted Internet Connection program to reduce the
number of government network connections to the Internet but reconsider goals and

24


i v. 	 c r E at i n g Ef f E c t i v E i n f o r m at i o n S h a r i n g a n d i n c i d En t r E S P o n S E

timelines based on a realistic assessment of the challenges. Some departments and agen­
cies during the past two years made progress reducing the number of connections and
beginning the deployment of systems that will help the Federal government prevent as
well as detect malicious behavior. The government, however, still has considerable work to
do before full capability is achieved and may need to consider additional policies to enable
full implementation of the strategy.
•	 Evaluate and continue, as appropriate—in ongoing consultation with the civil liberties and
privacy community—pilot deployments of intrusion detection and prevention systems for
the benefit of federal networks, evaluate the performance of these systems, and continue
studies of the issues that would arise if such capabilities were used with State government
systems. These sensors will be vital to gaining situational awareness for federal networks,
and the government will benefit from any policy, legal, or technology lessons learned as
these deployments move forward.
•	 Explore—in collaboration with industry and the civil liberties and privacy community—
additional, long-term architectures for intrusion detection and prevention systems.
The Federal government should improve its ability to provide strategic warning of cyber intrusions
and attacks to the President. The Federal government should continue to leverage the Nation’s
long-term investments in the fundamental development of cryptologic and information assurance
technologies and the necessary supporting infrastructure. These investments, along with other
intelligence capabilities, are critical to national strategic warning for attacks through cyberspace. In
addition, the Federal government should identify any gaps in law enforcement capacity or investi­
gative authority needed to defend the Nation’s infrastructure. Any new authorities would need to
be consistent with the protection of civil liberties and privacy rights.
The U.S. Government should invest in processes, technologies, and infrastructure that will help
prevent cyber incidents. Options include increased security testing, investment in systems that
automate or centralize network management, and more restricted connectivity to the Internet for
some unclassified systems.
The government needs a reliable, consistent mechanism for bringing all appropriate information
together to form a common operating picture. Federal cybersecurity centers often share their infor­
mation, but no single entity combines all information available from these centers and other sources
to provide a continuously updated, comprehensive picture of cyber threats and network status,
to provide indications and warning of imminent incidents, and to support a coordinated incident
response. The Defense Department is responsible for aggregating information on network health
and status, attempted intrusions, and cyber attacks for its networks, the Intelligence Community for
its networks, and US-CERT for civilian federal agencies and to some extent the private sector. Law
enforcement and intelligence agencies collect information on criminal and foreign cyber-related
threat activities but require additional capacity to deal with the scale of criminal activities.
The Federal government should consider whether available alternative or reserve communica­
tions would be adequate in the event of a major disruption of information and communications

25


c y b Er S Pac E P o li c y r Ev i Ew

infrastructure, particularly as information and communications networks converge. Replacement
or repair of infrastructure may also require additional planning and resources, particularly in the
event of physical damage to networks or hard-to-replace components of the power grid.
The Federal government should develop processes between all levels of government and the private
sector to assist in preventing, detecting, and responding to cyber incidents by leveraging existing
resources. To help build situational awareness related to the information and communications
infrastructure, the Federal government should leverage existing resources such as the Multi-State
Information Sharing and Analysis Center and the 58 State and local Fusion Centers that have been
set up around the country.

Enhance Information Sharing To Improve Incident Response Capabilities
Information is key to preventing, detecting, and responding to cyber incidents. Network hardware
and software providers, network operators, data owners, security service providers, and in some
cases, law enforcement or intelligence organizations may each have information that can contribute
to the detection and understanding of sophisticated intrusions or attacks. A full understanding
and effective response may only be possible by bringing information from those various sources
together for the benefit of all.
The Federal government should work with State, local, and tribal governments and the private
sector—including data owners, network operators, and experts on privacy and civil liberties—to
develop options for cybersecurity-related information sharing that address concerns with privacy
and proprietary information and make information sharing mutually beneficial in the national
interest. Private companies are concerned about the potential uses of their information. The gov­
ernment must protect privacy rights, law enforcement equities, intelligence sources and methods,
and government information that would provide unfair competitive advantages. Clarity and
accountability for both government and the private sector are needed to address these concerns.
Possible options include:
•	 Creation of a not-for-profit non-governmental organization to serve as a trusted third-party
host where government and private sector information may be shared to enhance the
security of critical government and private-sector networks. Such an organization could
leverage commercial services without disrupting the growing security service market.
•	 Continued engagement between the Federal government (e.g., law enforcement agencies)
and individual firms or groups of firms—possibly with the participation of State, local, and
tribal governments—that could achieve a level of voluntary information sharing within a
particular sector or region beyond what could be achieved in a broader setting.
The Administration should consider, in consultation with affected parties and Congress, develop­
ing tailored incentives for information sharing. These measures might include, as a last resort,
regulatory measures as part of an integrated approach to satisfying society’s interests in robust
and resilient critical infrastructures, civil liberties and privacy protections, and maintaining the
fair and open economic markets that underlie the U.S. economic system. Privacy enhancing

26


i v. c r E at i n g Ef f E c t i v E i n f o r m at i o n S h a r i n g a n d i n c i d En t r E S P o n S E

technologies such as encryption or controlled access authentication could ameliorate some risks
in sharing information.
The Federal government should undertake a comprehensive review of policies (such as security
classification and clearance requirements) that inhibit interagency sharing of cybersecurity infor­
mation, seek improvements in information sharing, and ensure that they preserve civil liberties and
privacy rights and appropriate protection for sensitive information. Current policies governing the
collection, use, retention, and dissemination of information by federal departments and agencies
vary greatly based on statutory authorities, privacy and civil liberties concerns, sources and methods
concerns, and historical practice. These policies present significant barriers to sharing cybersecurity
information across the Federal government. This review should take into account the progress
that the Federal government has made through the Security and Suitability Reform Initiative and
the Information Sharing Environment effort in examining all facets of the security and suitability
processing components.
The Federal government should work with the private sector to develop standards for incident
reporting by private-sector network operators to the Federal government. Industry has expressed
concerns about reporting cyber incidents to which they have fallen victim, including the potential
for negative impacts from resulting shareholder concerns, market reactions, or regulatory action.58
One industry group has proposed a government-industry working group to define sector-specific
cyber incident thresholds that warrant reporting to security officials.59 Use of such information by
the government would require rules and oversight, particularly for the protection of privacy rights
and civil liberties. Another way to increase reporting is through consideration of appropriate data
breach notification laws that require notification to the public and to the government, including
law enforcement entities that could pursue investigations. The Federal government also should
examine the effectiveness and scope of existing reporting requirements for regulated markets.
At the same time, the Federal government needs to define processes and rules for sharing its incident
reporting with the private sector. Formulation of these rules should consider classification and pri­
vacy issues. In addition, the Federal government should help the research community gain access,
with appropriate controls, to cybersecurity-related event data that could be used to develop tools,
test theories, and develop workable solutions. Such sharing would need to address the protection
of sensitive or proprietary data and personal identity information.
The Federal government should explore expanded sharing of information about network incidents
and vulnerabilities with major allies, seeking bilateral or multilateral arrangements that improve
cybersecurity consistent with the protection of other U.S. economic and security interests and the
protection of civil liberties and privacy rights. International collaboration makes effective govern­
ment-private sector collaboration in the United States more challenging. Legitimate private-sector
concerns over sharing information will increase if the government plans to share that information
with other countries. Once again, clarity and accountability are needed for control, dissemination,
and use of information shared by the private sector with the Federal government, including under­

standings governing the use of information shared between the United States and the international
community.

Improve Cybersecurity Across All Infrastructures
The Federal government should work with the private sector to define public-private partnership
roles and responsibilities for the defense of privately owned critical infrastructure and key resources.
The common defense of privately-owned critical infrastructures from armed attack or from physi­
cal intrusion or sabotage by foreign military forces or international terrorists is a core responsibility
of the Federal government. Similarly, government plays an important role in protecting these
infrastructures from criminals or domestic terrorists. The question remains unresolved as to what
extent protection of these same infrastructures from the same harms by the same actors should be
a government responsibility if the attacks were carried out remotely via computer networks rather
than by direct physical action. Most private network operators and service providers consider it to
be their responsibility to maintain and defend their own networks, but key elements of the private
sector have indicated a willingness to work toward a framework under which the government would
pursue malicious actors and assist with information and technical support to enable private-sector
operators to defend their own networks.60
The Federal government should consider options for incentivizing collective action and enhance
competition in the development of cybersecurity solutions. For example, the legal concepts for
“standard of care” to date do not exist for cyberspace. Possible incentives include adjustments to
liability considerations (reduced liability in exchange for improved security or increased liability for
the consequences of poor security), indemnification, tax incentives, and new regulatory require­
ments and compliance mechanisms.
The President’s cybersecurity policy official should work with all levels of government, the private
sector, and our international partners to develop strategies and plans to encourage the develop­
ment of innovative cybersecurity solutions and ensure the security and resilience of infrastructure
systems. Infrastructure examples include:
•	 The Administration should assist international financial institutions, such as the World Bank
and the International Monetary Fund, with the necessary information, tools, and expertise
and encourage their use of best practices to protect their information systems, which suf­
fered a series of serious intrusions in 2008.61

•	 The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act reserves funding to advance the use of
health information technology. Protection of patient information will be critical to gaining
public acceptance as electronic record keeping becomes more pervasive and accessible
through the Internet.
•	 The Department of Energy should work with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission
to determine whether additional security mandates and procedures should be developed
for energy-related industrial control systems. In addition, as the United States deploys
new Smart Grid technology, the Federal government must ensure that security standards
are developed and adopted to avoid creating unexpected opportunities for adversaries to

v. Encouraging innovation

resiliency requirements
The infrastructure must be resilient
against physical damage, unauthorized
manipulation, and electronic assault. In
addition to protection of the information
itself, a risk mitigation strategy for cyber­
space must focus on the devices used
to access the infrastructure, the services
provided by the infrastructure, support­
ing elements of the networks, and all
means of moving, storing, and process­
ing information. The strategy also must
include prevention, mitigation, and
response against threats to or subversion
of the people who operate and benefit
from the infrastructure, the processes
that run or take advantage of the infra­
structure, and the supply chains used to
build and maintain the infrastructure.

The information and communications sector is
moving toward a converged platform where data,
voice and video applications share a common infra­
structure. The decentralized nature of the current
Internet model allows individuals and entrepreneurs
to develop and deploy innovative applications at the
edges of the network without obtaining permission.
Innovation has sparked new multi-billion dollar busi­
nesses that have revolutionized the way users inter­
act with the network and each other. As technology
becomes more critical to the United States, maintain­
ing confidence and trust in this constantly evolving
infrastructure is essential. The President has called for
the federal government to work with industry on the
development of“next-generation secure computers
and networking for national security applications,”
“tough new standards for cybersecurity and physi­
cal resilience,” and “standards for securing personal
data.”63

The United States should harness the full benefits of innovation to address cybersecurity concerns.
Many technical and network management solutions that would greatly enhance security already
exist in the market place but are not always used because of cost or complexity. In addition, exist­
ing solutions can only do so much given the underlying design of the Internet architecture. In the
long run, openness and innovation will help create a stronger infrastructure with transparency and
accountability. Federal policy must address national security requirements, protection of intellec­
tual property, and the availability and continuity of infrastructure, even when it is under attack by
sophisticated adversaries. The Federal government also must be careful not to create policy and
regulation that inhibits innovation or results in inefficiencies or less security.

The Future
According to a 2006 National Academies Report, Renewing U.S. Telecommunications Research,
“Telecommunications networks are large, complex systems whose reliability, security, and evolv­
ability are dependent on the development of a coherent and well-conceived architectural concept.”64
The report goes on to note that:

“[M]ultiple vendors’products are used to configure U.S. telecommunications infra­
structure and deliver services … that cross provider boundaries. As a result of the
industry’s shift to a horizontal structure and its fragmentation into a large number
of firms, neither vendors nor service providers are prepared to take responsibility
for end-to-end systems design.”
As a result, no single, integrated vision exists to guide decision-making by the private sector,
academia, and government about policies, standards, research, market development, or procure­
ment. The Federal government, the private sector, and other stakeholders together should define
technology-neutral performance and security objectives for future infrastructure, both to meet its
own requirements as a consumer as well as in its capacity as a steward of the public interest. The
Federal government and its partners should create a family of coordinated national information and
communications infrastructure objectives, customized by sectors and organizations. These objec­
tives could consider different models of computing platforms or network control concepts, and the
emergence of technology solutions from government, academic, or industry research programs.
The movement of data and services to third-party network-based servers, referred to as the “cloud,”
introduces new policy challenges for the private sector and governments around the globe. The
movement of data across jurisdictional boundaries presents challenges for law enforcement, the
protection of privacy and civil liberties as defined by different countries, and liability decisions in
the event of data or network breaches. Some customers will seek to limit where service providers
move and store data, whereas others with multinational operations will seek to take advantage of
geographic and time-zone diversity.

infrastructure Security Visions
A number of efforts exist to define visions for some technology or infrastructure sectors. For example,
the U.S. Department of Energy, in collaboration with industry, in 2005 published a 10-year roadmap
for securing control systems used in the power grid (see www.controlsystemsroadmap.net). The
vision for this effort is that by 2015“control systems for critical applications will be designed, installed,
operated, and maintained to survive an intentional cyber attack with no loss of critical function.” An
advisory group for the Defense Advanced Research Project Agency (DARPA) describes defense of cur­
rent Internet Protocol-based networks as a losing proposition and calls for an “independent examina­
tion of alternate architectures,” leading to experimentation and evaluation of the best candidates.
According to a March 2009 briefing, DARPA is proceeding with a six-month analysis of alternatives.

Link R&D Frameworks to Infrastructure Development
Under the leadership of the President’s cybersecurity policy official, in collaboration with other
EOP entities and the ICI-IPC, the Federal government should provide a framework for research and
development strategies that focus on game-changing technologies that will help meet infrastruc­
ture objectives, building on the existing Networking and Information Technology Research and
Development (NITRD) strategies and other R&D-related work. The Federal government should
32


v.

En co u r ag i n g i n n ovat i o n

greatly expand coordination of these strategies with industry and academic research efforts to avoid
duplication, leverage and synchronize complementary capabilities and agendas, and ensure that
technology transitions and enters into the marketplace.
•	 To enhance U.S. competitiveness, the Federal government should work with industry to
develop migration paths and incentives for the rapid adoption of research and technology
development, including encouragement of collaboration between academic and industrial
laboratories.
•	 The Federal government, in collaboration with the private sector and other stakeholders,
also should use the infrastructure objectives and the R&D framework to help define goals
for national and international standardsbodies.

Establish Identity Management as an Option
We cannot improve cybersecurity without improving authentication, and identity management is
not just about authenticating people. Authentication mechanisms also can help ensure that online
transactions only involve trustworthy data, hardware, and software for networks and devices. With
the systems available today for most Internet transactions, the electronic equivalent of cues people
use to establish trust might be absent, incomplete, or difficult to understand and act upon.65 Identity
management has the potential to help individuals and organizations form trusted communities
based on varying degrees of identity exposure and mutually agreed accountability, while helping
exclude unwanted intruders or inappropriate membership. Identity management also has the
potential to enhance privacy through additional protection against the inappropriate release of
personal identifiable information.
The Federal government—in collaboration with industry and the civil liberties and privacy commu­
nities—should build a cybersecurity-based identity management vision and strategy for the Nation
that considers an array of approaches, including privacy-enhancing technologies. The Federal gov­
ernment must interact with citizens through myriad information, services, and benefit programs
and thus has an interest in the protection of the public’s private information as well. Increased use
of on-line transactions involving financial, health, and commerce require a basis for building trust
between the parties to a transaction.
•	 The Nation should implement, for high-value activities (e.g., the Smart Grid), an opt-in array
of interoperable identity management systems to build trust for online transactions and
to enhance privacy.
•	 The National Science and Technology Council’s (NSTC’s) Subcommittee on Biometrics and
Identity Management in 2008 published a report that provides a vision for future federal
identity management and a series of research and development recommendations.66 The
Federal government should use this report as a starting point for identity management
strategies.

•	 The Federal government should work with international partners to develop policies that
encourage the development of a global, trusted eco-system that protects privacy rights and
civil liberties and governs appropriate use of law enforcement activities to protect citizens
and infrastructures.
The Federal government, following the guidance of Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12
(HSPD-12), is seeking to leverage the federal interoperable identity credentialing mechanism across
the federal enterprise. The Federal government should ensure resources are available for full federal
implementation of HSPD-12. The Federal government also should consider extending the avail­
ability of federal identity management systems to operators of critical infrastructure and to privatesector emergency response and repair service providers for use during national emergencies.

Integrate Globalization Policy with Supply Chain Security
One of the results of the information technology revolution and free trade policies is a global envi­
ronment for research, design, manufacturing, and servicing of information and communications
products by corporations with facilities spread across the globe. This global marketplace has created
tremendous benefits for U.S. industry by opening markets worldwide for high-tech U.S. goods and
services. However, the emergence of new centers for manufacturing, design, and research across the
globe raises concerns about the potential for easier subversion of computers and networks through
subtle hardware or software manipulations. Counterfeit products have created the most visible
supply problems, but few documented examples exist of unambiguous, deliberate subversions.
A broad, holistic approach to risk management is required rather than a wholesale condemnation
of foreign products and services. The challenge with supply chain attacks is that a sophisticated
adversary might narrowly focus on particular systems and make manipulation virtually impossible
to discover. Foreign manufacturing does present easier opportunities for nation-state adversaries
to subvert products; however, the same goals could be achieved through the recruitment of key
insiders or other espionage activities.
The best defense may be to ensure U.S. market leadership through continued innovation that
enhances U.S. market leadership and the application of best practices in maintaining diverse, resil­
ient supply chains and infrastructures. The President’s cybersecurity policy official, working with
departments and agencies, should:
•	 Define procurement strategies through the General Services Administration, building on
work by the National Security Agency for the Department of Defense, for commercial prod­
ucts and services in order to create market incentives for security to be part of hardware and
software product designs, new security technologies, and secure managed services;
•	 Expand partnerships with State, local, and tribal governments and international partners
to maximize the market influence of these procurements;
•	 Work with Congress to identify mechanisms that would enable departments and agencies—
under appropriate, limited situations—to incorporate threat information into acquisition
decisions; and

34

En co u r ag i n g i n n ovat i o n

•	 Work with industry to provide threat information and identify best practices for managing
supply chain and insider risks, both from economic and threat perspectives.

Maintain National Security/Emergency Preparedness (NS/EP) Capabilities
The Federal government’s obligation to protect the American people and to provide for the com­
mon defense includes a responsibility to ensure that the Nation can communicate and respond in
times of crisis. The communications system itself might bear the brunt of such events and must have
resilience or the capability to recover to manage a response and preserve governmental functions.
The Communications Act of 1934 authorized the President, if he deems it necessary in the national
security or defense and the requisite threshold condition exists, to use, control, or close commu­
nications services, systems, and networks under the jurisdiction of the Federal Communications
Commission in conditions ranging from “state of public peril”to “war.” Executive Order 12472 estab­
lished a joint government-industry National Coordinating Center to assist in the initiation, coordina­
tion, restoration and reconstitution of communications services or facilities under all conditions of
crisis or emergency. NSPD-51/HSPD-20 on“National Continuity Policy”(May 4, 2007) assigns roles
in the Federal government regarding continuity communications.
The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) is working toward the goal of providing national
security and emergency users with access to the converged information services of next-generation
networks in a manner that provides a high likelihood of service success during disasters and other
events that cause public users to experience severe degradation or loss of communications ser­
vices. The national security enhancements to next-generation networks will include services for
data, voice, and video. The DHS effort is complicated by the variations in architectures envisioned
by the major carriers and service providers. As such, DHS is examining and comparing different
approaches and will seek industry consensus on approaches to be brought forward for consideration
by standards organizations. The Federal government should:
•	 Develop a coordinated plan for national security and emergency preparedness commu­
nications capabilities over next-generation networks, including milestones and funding
requirements;
•	 Develop options for additional services the Federal government could acquire or direct
investments the government could make in the information and communications infra­
structure to enhance the survivability of communications during a time of natural disaster,
crisis, or conflict;
•	 Coordinate with international partners and standards bodies to support next-generation
NS/EP communications capabilities in a globally distributed next-generation environment;67
and
•	 Ensure that efforts associated with the development of Executive Branch continuity com­
munications architectures and next-generation services programs are adequately staffed
and resourced.

appendix b: methodology

The globally interconnected information and communications infrastructure often known as
“cyberspace”underpins every facet of American society and provides critical support for the national
economy, civil infrastructure, security, and military power. Recognizing its importance to the nation,
the President directed the National and Homeland Security Councils to conduct a 60-day compre­
hensive, “clean-slate”review to assess U.S. cyberspace policies and structures. The review begins to
carry out the President’s pledge to “lead an effort, working with private industry, the research com­
munity and our citizens, to build a trustworthy and accountable cyber infrastructure that is resilient,
protects America’s competitive advantage, and advances our national and homeland security.”

Defining the scope of the review and establishing a clear end-state goal
Pursuant to the President’s direction, the White House staff established the review’s scope and
defined the end-state goal, which was vetted through the Interagency Policy Committee (IPC) pro­
cess and approved by the NSC-HSC Deputies Committee. When achieved, that end goal of trusted
and resilient communications and information infrastructures built through a national public-private
partnership and action plan will:
•	 Enhance economic prosperity and facilitate U.S. market leadership in the information and
communications industry;
•	 Enable the United States to deter, prevent, detect, defend against, respond to, and remedi­
ate interruptions and damage to U.S. information and communications infrastructure;
•	 Ensure U.S. capabilities to operate in cyberspace in support of national goals; while at the
same time
•	 Protect privacy rights and preserving civil liberties.
This review addresses all missions and activities associated with the information and communica­
tions infrastructure, including computer network defense, military, and intelligence missions and
the intersection thereof with information assurance, counter intelligence, counter terrorism and
telecommunications policies. It seeks to identify the policy gaps, organizational redundancies,
overlapping missions, legal questions, civil liberties and privacy concerns, and other unresolved
issues across the above mission spaces. The review does not provide an in-depth analysis of options
or an extensive audit of programs; rather, it presents the need for a more balanced and integrated
policy-making approach to address the convergence of the Nation’s economic and security interests
in the digitally-dependent global environment of the 21st Century.

Inventorying requirements of cyber, communications, and homeland
security and counter-terrorism mission areas as well as recommendations
from government advisory boards and private-sector studies
During the first ten days, the review team inventoried more than 250 requirements (some overlap­
ping) from the relevant Presidential policy directives, executive orders, national strategies, and
studies from government advisory boards and private sector entities. The review team solicited
input from departments and agencies on their specific cyber activities, authorities, and capabilities
across these requirements and requested departments and agencies to identify any new or existing
requirements that may not have been identified as part of the initial inventory. During this phase,
governmental legal experts identified more than 80 issues associated with the scope of the 60-day
cyber review. Those lawyers are addressing the highest priority legal issues in papers that identify
common facts, applicable law, differences in legal interpretation, and options for resolution. In
addition, the review team consulted governmental civil liberties and privacy officials to identify
and assess relevant issues.

Capturing the viewpoints of key cyber stakeholders on requirements to
meet the end-state goal
The review team reached out to a wide array of stakeholders inside and outside the Federal gov­
ernment. Recognizing that there are opportunities for everyone—academia, industry, and gov­
ernment—to work together to build a trusted and resilient communications and information
infrastructure, the review team ensured that these stakeholders were aware of the review’s scope
and asked for input on pertinent areas of interest.
The engagement process included over 40 meetings and yielded over 100 papers that named
specific recommendations and desired goals. Stakeholders’responses and public statements (e.g.,
Congressional testimony) helped to identify key requirements, illuminate policy gaps, suggest areas
of improvement or collaboration, and frame the decision space for cyberspace policy. The review
team synthesized the results into overarching themes and issues for further consideration.
In some cases, the individuals who submitted materials did so in their personal capacity as experts,
rather than as representatives or affiliates of particular entities (such as universities). In all cases, the
participants’submission of information does not imply that they endorse the results of the review
in part or in full.

The Private Sector
The U.S. depends upon a privately owned, globally operated digital infrastructure. The review team
engaged with industry to continue building the foundation of a trusted partnership. This engage­
ment underscored the importance of developing value propositions that are understood by both
government and industry partners. It also made clear that increasing information sharing is not
enough; the government must foster an environment for collaboration. The following industry
groups and venues participated: the Armed Forces Communications and Electronics Association

(AFCEA), Business Executives for National Security (BENS), the Business Software Alliance (BSA),
the Center for Strategic and International Studies’(CSIS) Commission on Cybersecurity for the 44th
Presidency, the Communications Sector Coordinating Council (C-SCC), the Cross-Sector Cyber
Security Working Group (CSCSWG), the Defense Industrial Base Executive Committee, the Financial
and Banking Information Infrastructure Committee (FBIIC), the Financial Services Sector Coordinating
Council (FS-SCC), the Intelligence and National Security Alliance (INSA), the Internet Security Alliance
(ISA), the Information Technology Sector Coordinating Council (IT-SCC), the National Infrastructure
Advisory Council (NIAC), the National Security Telecommunications Advisory Committee (NSTAC),
TechAmerica, and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

Civil Liberties and Privacy Community
Robust protections for civil liberties and privacy needed to be considered at the outset. The 60-day
review team began a dialogue with key members of the civil liberties and privacy community, includ­
ing both advocates and independent experts, to discuss measures for protecting the information
and communications infrastructure and how those measures may impact individual users. The
review team’s civil liberties and privacy community engagement included affiliates of the American
Civil Liberties Union, the American Library Association, the Cato Institute, the Center for Democracy
and Technology, Carnegie Mellon University, Consumer Action, the Center on National Security
Studies, Cornell University, the Electronic Frontier Foundation, the Electronic Privacy Information
Center, George Washington University, Harvard University, Indiana University, Johns Hopkins
University, OMB Watch, Ohio State University, the National Security Archive, and the University of
California-San Diego.

Academic and Research Community
The academic and open cybersecurity research community has contributed many important tech­
nological innovations and continues to be a valuable resource for the future of the nation’s efforts
to design, build and deploy trustworthy systems. The National Science Foundation assembled more
than sixty academics from universities across the country to contribute to the 60-day cyber policy
review. Their areas of interest included privacy; computer networking and security; cryptography
and web security; trust and risk; Internet commerce, usability, and feasibility; usable privacy and
security; network security and architecture; theory of network security; biologically-inspired security;
systems security; systems and software engineering; systems and wireless security and botnets;
host security and usability; e-vote security; the power grid; clean-slate security; and theoretical
computer science and nanotechnology, among other disciplines. These academics were affiliated
with the following institutions: Brown University, Carnegie Mellon University, Columbia University,
Cornell University, Dartmouth College, Georgia Tech, Indiana University, Johns Hopkins University,
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New York University, North Carolina State University,
Purdue University, Princeton University, SRI International, Stanford University, the University of
California-Berkeley, the University of California-Santa Barbara, the University of Illinois at UrbanaChampaign, the University of New Mexico, the University of Southern California, the University of
Washington, and Yale University.

State and Local Constituents
State governments are experiencing many of the same network intrusions and infections as the
Federal government. Recognizing that the Nation must identify ways to leverage State resources,
provide assistance, and continue cooperation, the 60-day cyber policy review team engaged with
state Chief Information Security Officers (CISO) and Chief Information Officers (CIO) through the
Office of Management and Budget’s E-Government and Information Technology Office and the
Department of Homeland Security’s US-CERT. The Multi-State Information Sharing Advisory Council
(MS-ISAC) and National Governors Association were also engaged to gain a better understanding
of State and local needs.

Independent U.S. Government Agencies
While it is often preferable to allow markets to create appropriate incentives for desired behaviors,
there are occasions when government intervention is necessary. Ensuring the health, security, and
growth potential of the U.S. information and communications infrastructure will require a success­
ful partnership between government and the private sector. The 60-day cyber policy review team
reached out to regulatory agencies for their views on sound regulation for an effective market­
place. The Commodity Futures Trading Commission, the Federal Communications Commission,
the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Federal Reserve Board of Governors, the Federal
Trade Commission, the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency (a component of the Department
of the Treasury rather than an independent agency), and the Securities and Exchange Commission
all provided information or met with the review team.
The 60-day cyber review team also met with independent agencies such as the Social Security
Administration which uses on-line services to interact daily with the American public. Additional
information was considered regarding the Federal Aviation Administration and the informational
services it provides to the Nation.

The United States Congress
The 60-day cyber policy review team recognizes that Congress must be engaged at every stage of
the review and will have important roles to play going forward. Creating and maintaining a trans­
parent and connected democracy is a key tenet of the Administration. Accordingly, the review
team engaged Members and staff of the Congress across 10 committees in both chambers and
also provided a briefing to the House Cyber Caucus.

Foreign Partners
The United States cannot succeed by acting in isolation, because cyberspace crosses geographic
and jurisdictional boundaries. The United States must work actively with countries around the
world to make the digital infrastructure a trusted, safe, and secure place that enables prosperity for
all nations. The 60-day cyber policy review team engaged with key U.S. allies to learn how they are
organizing for this challenge and to understand their mission requirements and priorities. One area
needing further study is whether and in what ways elements of the information and communica­
tions infrastructure ought to be treated as a global commons.

Conducting gap analyses, reviewing program effectiveness, and identifying 

policy gaps, overlaps, and opportunities for collaboration
The review team queried and analyzed responses from 21 Federal departments and agencies to
identify areas where cyberspace policy gaps exist, where mission areas overlap, and where there
are opportunities for collaboration between agencies. This analysis suggested that any complete
national cyber policy must consider, at a minimum, the following elements:
•	 Governance: Encompasses U.S. Government (USG) structures for policy development and
coordination of operational activities related to the cyber mission across the Executive
Branch. This element includes reviewing overlapping missions and responsibilities that are
the result of authority being vested with various departments and agencies.
•	 Architecture: Addresses the performance, cost, and security characteristics of existing infor­
mation and communications systems and infrastructures as well as strategic planning for
the optimal system characteristics that will be needed in the future. This element includes
standards, identity management, authentication and attribution, software assurance,
research and development, procurement, and supply chain risk management.

Appendix C: Growth of Modern 

Communications Technology in the United 

States and Development of Supporting 

Legal and Regulatory Frameworks

This paper highlights some of the significant historical milestones in the growth and convergence
of modern communications media and information technology in the United States over the last
century, along with the increasing importance of these media to support commercial, societal,
and governmental purposes. It also attempts to trace at a high level some of the corresponding
milestones in law, regulation, and policy that were intended to accommodate needs associated
with these changing uses. Rooted in the Nation’s experience with wire and radio media and com­
munications in the 20th Century, present U.S. laws and policies governing cyberspace reflect serial
attempts to keep pace with newly emerging challenges presented by the rapid technological and
marketplace changes in communications, computing, networking, and security technologies.
This review is not meant to be exhaustive; nor does it seek to present legal analysis of the laws and
instruments discussed.1 Rather, it attempts only to capture noteworthy highlights of the histori­
cal progression to survey the landscape of Federal authorities that now apply to information and
communications technology and systems. The picture that emerges shows this landscape to be an
elaborate patchwork of domestic and international laws and structures that shape policy options.

Early Development and Use of the Media for Civil and
Commercial Purposes
The development of the electric telegraph in the 1840s and the telephone in the late 1870s made
rapid long-distance communications possible. Both media began in local areas and then rapidly
spread to connect large parts of the Nation and the world. Fewer than five years after its introduc­
tion, over 47,000 telephones were being used in the United States. The growth of these commu­
nications media accelerated the pace of social interaction, migration, commerce, and government
activities.
The telegraph and, to a greater degree, the telephone continued to be the principal media for
telecommunications for most of the 20th Century. The introduction of undersea cables in the late
1850s enabled worldwide communications structures and the expansion of the leading telecom­
munications companies to a dominant position in the industry.

The invention of “wireless telegraphy”(now known as“radio”) at the turn of the 20th Century greatly
increased the mobility of official and personal communications and made greater volumes of com­
munications possible. Radio quickly emerged as both a medium for point-to-point (e.g., ship-to­
shore) and point-to-multipoint telecommunications (e.g., police dispatch) and a mass medium for
information, entertainment, and commerce. Fueled by technological advances like the amplifying
vacuum tube in 1913, both coast-to-coast telephony and transatlantic radio transmission became
possible, weaving the world even closer together. The utility and consequent worldwide adoption
and rapid evolution of these new communications media prompted the creation of new legal and
regulatory regimes both internationally and domestically to set rates, standardize terms of service,
and allocate frequency bands to radio services by country.
The advent of international communications via telegraph led to the International Telegraph Union
Convention and the formation of the International Telegraph Union in 1865, and the United States
became a member in 1908. The Department of State has led U.S. delegations to this organization
(and its successor) since the United States first joined it. Communication via radiotelegraph led to
the International Radiotelegraph Convention in 1906.
On the domestic front, the Radio Act of 1912 established a radio licensing regime within the
Department of Commerce and required certain ships to carry radios for communications. Due to
conflict between amateur radio operators and the U.S. Navy and corporations, the Radio Act further
regulated private radio communications, thus setting the precedent for federal regulation of wire­
less communications.
In the Radio Act of 1927, Congress directed the transfer of this radio frequency licensing regime
from the Department of Commerce (with the notable exception of federal agencies’ authorization
to use radio frequencies) to a newly created five-member independent agency, the Federal Radio
Commission. The Radio Act of 1927 also outlawed the interception of private radio messages and
divulging their contents. Regulation of wireline communications remained separate from wire­
less, however, with responsibility shared between the Commerce Department and the Interstate
Commerce Commission. Following on the popularity of radio, television debuted in the 1920s and
by the 1950s was firmly entrenched.
The next noteworthy developments came less than a decade later, in 1934. First, the International
Telegraph Convention and the International Radiotelegraph Convention combined, and the
International Telegraph Union was renamed the International Telecommunication Union (ITU).
In 1949, the ITU became a specialized agency of the United Nations. The ITU Constitution and
Convention are updated every four years and will next be negotiated again in 2010 at the ITU
Plenipotentiary Conference in Veracruz, Mexico.
Second, coinciding with the establishment of the ITU, Congress enacted the Communications Act of
1934, which replaced the Federal Radio Commission with a new agency, the Federal Communications
Commission (FCC) and consolidated in it authorities for both wireless and wireline communications.
In particular, the Communications Act gave the FCC broad authority to regulate:

interstate and foreign commerce in communication by wire and radio so as to make
available, without discrimination on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin,
or sex, a rapid efficient, Nation-wide, and world-wide wire and radio communica­
tion service with adequate facilities at reasonable charges, for the purpose of the
national defense, for the purpose of promoting safety of life and property through
the use of wire and radio communication . . . .2
Since its inception, the FCC has remained the primary institution responsible for formulating and
implementing U.S. policies and regulations governing private, commercial electronic communica­
tions within the United States and between the United States and other countries. Its jurisdiction
over “communication by wire and radio” has been reinforced by multiple amendments to the
Communications Act over the years. This has enabled the FCC to affect the economic and technical
development of virtually all types of electronic communications, including telegraph, telephone
service, cable television, radio, television, wireless telecommunications and, more recently, emerg­
ing advanced telecommunications technologies and services. Separate from the FCC, however,
the White House with support from the Department of Commerce retained a role in management
of the Federal government’s use of radio spectrum, and in the development of executive branch
policies related to communications, for another 44 years.3
Innovation in electronic communications continued to progress during the 1940s. The need to
deliver television signals to communities in remote mountain areas led to the early development
of community antenna television (CATV) systems, which, with the adoption of coaxial cable, and
more recently fiber optic cable, would later evolve into the modern cable television systems that
now compete with telephone companies to deliver video, voice, and data services to customers. It
was also during this decade that radio and telephony intersected with the invention of the transistor
and the advent of mobile radiotelephone technology. Broader commercial and public use of mobile
telephone service began in the 1970s, and the first commercial cellular networks were developed in
1982 and 1983. By 2004, wireless subscribership in the United States had exceeded 180 million.
The first experimental communications satellite was launched in 1962. It was the first satellite to
receive, amplify, and simultaneously re-transmit signals from earth. The development of satellite
communications available not only to governments but also the commercial sector and individuals
led to even greater volumes of communications worldwide.
As noted above, for most of the 20th Century, the White House directly managed executive branch
communications policy and the Federal government’s use of the radio spectrum, supported by
the Department of Commerce. In 1978, however, the Carter Administration disaggregated and
reorganized telecommunications functions within the Executive Branch. In Executive Order 12046,4
President Carter dissolved the White House Office of Telecommunications Policy (OTP) and trans­
47 U.S.C. § 151.
Over the course of time, telecommunications policy in the White House was managed variously by a Telecommunications Advisor to
the President, 1951-53; the Office of Defense Mobilization (later the Office of Defense and Civilian Mobilization), 1953-61; the Office of
Emergency Planning (later the Office of Emergency Preparedness), 1961-70; and, finally, the Office of Telecommunications Policy, 1970­
78. See National Archives & Records Administration, Records of the National Telecommunications and Information Administration, § 417.1

ferred its responsibilities, respectively, either to the Commerce Department or back to the President
for re-delegation to other components within his Executive Office.
Responsibility for Federal radio spectrum management and development and presentation of
telecommunications and information policies on behalf of the Executive Branch were transferred to
the Commerce Department, and a new agency, the National Telecommunications and Information
Administration (NTIA), was established to perform them.5 These responsibilities were codified by
the NTIA Organization Act in 1992.6 By contrast, OTP’s responsibility to advise the President, and
develop and establish policies, regarding procurement and management of Federal telecommuni­
cations systems, were reassigned to the Office of Management and Budget (OMB).7 Similarly, OTP’s
responsibilities relating to emergency and national security communications were reassigned to
the National Security Council (NSC) and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP).8

Use of Communications Technologies in Support of Critical
Government Functions
As public adoption of each new generation of communications and information technology grew,
use by government correspondingly increased. State, local, and tribal authorities have adopted
these technologies for a variety of applications ranging from more efficient execution of routine
administrative functions and improving government services and access to government informa­
tion, to support for law enforcement efforts. The Federal government has employed evolving
communications and information technologies for all of these purposes as well, but it has also
applied them for critical national functions including foreign affairs, military command and control,
and intelligence efforts.
For example, following the deployment of the first successful transatlantic cable in 1866, the tele­
graph became an important tool for U.S. diplomacy and remained so through most of the 20th
Century. Spurred by the development of Morse Code, the telegraph was widely employed for mili­
tary purposes as well during the U.S. Civil War, and as early as 1904, the U.S. Navy was using wireless
telegraphy for communications with its bases in the Caribbean Sea.
Recognizing the pivotal importance of communications to support the execution of government
functions during a crisis, Congress, by joint resolution in 1918, authorized the President to assume
control of any telegraph, telephone, marine cable or radio system or systems in the U.S. and to
operate them as needed for the duration of World War I.9 Relying on this Congressional authoriza­
tion, President Wilson issued a proclamation asserting possession, control and supervision over
While NTIA is the principal adviser to the President on matters related to telecommunications, other Federal agencies routinely repre­
sent executive branch views on matters related to the public safety and national security before the FCC. For example, in the context of 

the Communications Assistance for Law Enforcement Act (CALEA), the Department of Justice and the Federal Bureau of Investigation 

have submitted comments regarding published industry standards that do not satisfy CALEA’s requirements or adequately address law 

enforcement and national security equities.

every telegraph and telephone system within the United States.10 To preserve support for critical
government communications needs during times of crisis, Congress later included in Section 706
of the Communications Act of 1934 authority for the President to control private communications
systems within the United States during wartime.11
As governments around the world increased their use of electronic communications for diplomatic,
military, and other functions, vulnerabilities of long-range radio communications made it possible to
intercept foreign communications from faraway locations without the knowledge of the communi­
cators. The potential for “signals intelligence”(SIGINT) greatly increased. Conversely, the potential for
interception of electronic communications led to the need for improved communications security
(COMSEC) technologies and efforts: Nations including the United States sought more sophisticated
means to protect their communications from interception, generally relying on electromechanical
machines to encipher and decipher messages. COMSEC and Computer Security (COMPUSEC) prac­
tices were merged in the late 1980s to create Information Systems Security and, later, Information
Assurance. Pursuant to Executive Order 12333, as amended, the Secretary of Defense serves as
the Executive Agent for SIGINT and the Director of the National Security Agency (NSA) serves as
Functional Manager for SIGINT and National Manager for National Security Systems.12
Use of electronic surveillance for legitimate purposes such as intelligence and law enforcement
investigation, as well as for illegitimate purposes, spurred enactment of a number of laws intended
to comprehensively address such activities. Congress enacted the first federal wiretap statute as
a temporary measure to prevent disclosure of domestic telephone or telegraph communications
during the First World War.13 The Communications Act of 1934 extended the ban on intercepting and
divulging of messages to telephone and telegraph communications. In 1968, Congress passed Title
III of the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act (the Federal Wiretap Act),14 and 18 years later
enacted the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 (ECPA),15 which substantially revised
Title III to provide coverage for the technological advances developed in the area of electronic com­
munications since the passage of the original act. In 1978, Congress enacted the Foreign Intelligence
Surveillance Act (FISA),16 which established the framework for conducting electronic surveillance
for foreign intelligence purposes.17
World events and changes in the communications marketplace also prompted changes in govern­
ment organizational structures and policies. In response to communications problems experienced
during the Cuban Missile Crisis, President Kennedy in 1963 established the National Communications
40 Stat. 1807-1808.

While Title III governs domestic surveillance and FISA relates to surveillance conducted for foreign intelligence purposes, the two laws 

share several common characteristics. Both prescribe authorization procedures that must be followed before electronic surveillance 

can be conducted, including judicial approval of surveillance applications; minimization of interceptions by surveilling officials; and 

limitations on the use of intercepted information. Both statutes also impose criminal and civil penalties on unauthorized surveillance 

activities. See U.S. Department of Justice, Criminal Resource Manual, 1073 The Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, available at http://

System (NCS).18 Two decades later, responding in part to the break-up of AT&T, President Reagan re­
chartered and strengthened the NCS, increasing its membership and establishing an administrative
structure to ensure that national telecommunications infrastructure is responsive to national security
and emergency preparedness (NS/EP) needs.19 By its terms, the executive order was intended to
support “improved execution of national security and emergency preparedness telecommunica­
tions functions,” but it did not address information systems, or converged information and com­
munications networks which now provide the foundation for most critical NS/EP communications
requirements.
Executive Order 12472 continued the disaggregation and realignment of telecommunications
responsibilities started in E.O. 12046, especially with respect to NS/EP functions. First, it established
two new roles, Executive Agent and Manager of the NCS, who were responsible for oversight and
day-to-day administration of the NCS organization.20 It also bifurcated responsibilities for certain
NS/EP functions among elements within the Executive Office of the President (EOP). For example, it
charged the NSC to provide policy direction for the exercise of the President’s war power functions
under the Communications Act but gave the OSTP responsibility to direct the exercise of those
functions.21 The E.O. created a similar split of responsibilities with respect to the exercise of the
President’s non-wartime emergency telecommunications functions; the identification, allocation,
and use of the Nation’s telecommunications resources during a crisis or emergency; and planning
and oversight activities.22

Emergence of Computing, the Internet, and the Convergence of
Information and Communications Technology
Computers. The development of electronic computing systems following World War II fostered the
transition from analog to digital technology. Increasing miniaturization led to high adaptability of
computers for many different modes of communications. The first e-mail program was created in
1971, and the first PC modem was invented in 1977, enabling digital computers to communicate
with one another over analog telephone lines. The first popular computers for the mass consumer
market first emerged in the early 1980s, coincident in time with the emergence of the Internet as a
global network-of-networks. This new, retail computing capability was quickly adopted by govern­
ment, private commercial entities, and the general public.
As the data speeds of modems progressively increased, computer users were encouraged to con­
nect to the telephone network to access newly-emerging online services (e.g., CompuServe and
America Online), which, in turn, fueled the market for new online applications and services of value
to consumers. The World Wide Web, first conceptualized in 1984, came into widespread public use
a decade later as a ubiquitous environment accessible through the telephone network. The corre­

sponding progressive migration from the traditional copper telephone infrastructure and co-axial
cable to fiber optic infrastructure has delivered increased bandwidth and speed to users.
As information technology and systems evolved, Congress enacted a separate body of law governing
computers and information systems. The Brooks Act,23 enacted in 1965, gave the National Bureau
of Standards—now the Department of Commerce’s National Institute of Standards and Technology
(NIST)—responsibilities for developing automatic data processing standards and guidelines pertain­
ing to Federal computer systems. The responsibilities assigned to NBS, however, did not apply to
the procurement of automatic data processing equipment or services by the Central Intelligence
Agency or to what are now called “national security systems” by the Department of Defense. The
Computer Security Act of 1987,24 which further amended the Brooks Act, gave NIST the authority for
developing standards and guidelines for the security of non-national security systems and required
NIST to collaborate with NSA.
The Federal Information Security Management Act of 2002 (FISMA)25 amended the Computer
Security Act, leaving intact the roles of NIST and NSA, but it gave OMB expanded information secu­
rity oversight responsibilities over all Executive Branch departments and agencies; it authorized
the Director of OMB to require agencies to follow the standards and guidelines developed by NIST,
review agency security programs annually and approve or disapprove them, and take authorized
actions to ensure compliance. FISMA did not change, however, the dichotomy that exists in the
treatment of civilian and national security systems.
While national security systems continued to be excluded from NIST oversight,26 other regimes
were established to deal with them, most notably National Security Directive 42. NSD-42, issued
in July 1990, expanded the scope of a previously chartered national security telecommunications
policy coordinating body to encompass information systems as well. In addition, it established a
new body, the National Security Telecommunications and Information Systems Security Committee
(NSTISSC). The NSTISSC was charged, among other things, to provide systems security guidance for
national security systems for Executive Branch departments and agencies and to develop appropri­
ate “operating policies, procedures, guidelines, instructions, standards, objectives, and priorities as
may be required . . . .”27 The NSTISSC shared many of the structural characteristics of the NCS, includ­
ing an interagency membership structure (which included the Manager of the NCS) administered
by an Executive Agent, which function was assigned to the Secretary of Defense, and a National
Manager (the Director of NSA) that assists the Secretary in executing assigned information assur­
ance responsibilities.28

Development of the Internet. Consistent with the need to ensure the continuity of communications
for these critical national security needs, the Federal government, in 1962, commissioned a study
on how the government could maintain command and control over its missiles and bombers after
a nuclear attack. This effort yielded a concept for a network that would break up the information
into “packets”sent through various computers and could be reassembled at the destination location.
Unlike the conventional hub and spoke telephone system available at the time, an attack on any one
part of the proposed system would allow the undamaged portions to continue operating. During
the 1960s, what is now the Department of Defense (DOD) Advanced Research Projects Agency
(DARPA) sought to develop this network idea, eventually establishing ARPANET, a computer link
between the University of California, Los Angeles, and the Stanford Research Institute, in 1969.29
ARPANET expanded significantly during the 1980s, interconnecting with numerous educational
institutions and a growing number of companies that were participating in government research
projects or providing services to entities participating in such projects. Moreover, during this
time, other packet-switched networks were emerging in the United States and elsewhere around
the world (e.g., Europe, Australia, Japan, Singapore, and Thailand) and seeking to connect to this
“Internet.”30 This network-of-networks continued to grow over the course of the next decade until,
in 1997, the United States government undertook to privatize the Internet’s domain name and
addressing system (DNS) in a manner intended to increase competition and facilitate international
participation in its management.

A Shift in the Law, and the Emergence of “Cybersecurity”
As the Internet grew, the government, like the private sector, rapidly adopted this new medium
for a wide variety of applications including interconnecting the civilian department and agency,
defense, and intelligence community networks across the government to facilitate more rapid com­
munications and common processing tasks. While this evolution was progressing, policy makers in
Congress and the Executive Branch were separately considering dramatic changes to the legal and
regulatory framework that had governed communications technologies and markets for decades.
Invigorated by the emergence of competition in the long distance telephone market following the
breakup of AT&T, policy makers reexamined regulatory frameworks that had historically perpetu­
ated monopolistic market structures (e.g., local exchange telephone and cable television services)
and sought to replace them with new regimes that would stimulate the emergence of competition,
lowering costs for consumers and accelerating the development and deployment of advanced
telecommunications infrastructures.

29
Following on this research, international packet switching network standards were developed in collaboration with entities in other
countries under the auspices of the ITU. During the 1970s, DARPA pursued further work on a network protocol that would permit
multiple computer networks to interconnect and communicate with each other, which led to the development of the transfer control
protocol/internet protocol (TCP/IP) in the late 1970s. At this time, the term “internetworking” was coined, eventually leading to the term
“Internet” as a shorthand term for this network of networks.
30
In the mid-1980s, NASA, the National Science Foundation (NSF) and the Department of Energy (DOE) worked on development of a
successor to ARPANET and created the first multi-protocol wide area network, called the NASA Science Internet or NSI. As a high-speed,
multi-protocol, international network, NSI provided connectivity to over 20,000 scientists across all seven continents. Also in the 1980s,
CERN, the European Organization for Nuclear Research, installed and operated TCP/IP, first, to interconnect its internal computer systems
and, then, to provide external connections to other computer systems worldwide.

The Telecommunications Act of 199631 represented the first major overhaul of telecommunications
law since the enactment of the Communications Act. Its stated purpose was to “promote competi­
tion and reduce regulation in order to secure lower prices and higher quality services for American
telecommunications consumers and encourage the rapid deployment of new telecommunica­
tions technologies.”32 The 1996 Act significantly deregulated U.S. telecommunications markets,
eliminating regulatory barriers that had previously prevented various types of service providers
from competing with one another: it opened the door for local telephone companies to provide
long distance services and for long distance carriers and cable television operators to provide local
phone service. Cognizant of the potential of then-emerging digital communications networks, the
1996 Act articulated that:
the policy of the United States [is] . . . to promote the continued development of
the Internet and other interactive computer services and other interactive media
. . . [and] preserve the vibrant and competitive free market that presently exists
for the Internet and other interactive computer services, unfettered by Federal or
State regulation . . . .33
The thirteen years since the Telecommunications Act was passed have witnessed significant growth
and transformation in the telecommunications marketplace. Advanced wireline and, increasingly,
wireless broadband network infrastructures have been (and continue to be) deployed that provide
an increasingly diverse array of applications and services to both commercial and individual users,
accessible over a growing variety of fixed and mobile devices. They support the clearing of bil­
lions of dollars in transactions among financial institutions, trading on exchanges, online banking,
e-commerce, as well as billing and account management for many retailers and service providers;
they facilitate rapid, global communications and the storage and transfer of enormous volumes of
information, including proprietary business information, intellectual property, customer account and
transaction information, and other personally identifiable private user information such as health
records; they make an array of heretofore inaccessible information available at the user’s fingertips
with a few keystrokes. They have also become essential elements in the operation and manage­
ment of a range of critical infrastructure functions, including transportation systems, shipping, the
electric power grid, oil and gas pipelines, nuclear plants, water systems, critical manufacturing, and
many others.
The capabilities of these systems have also changed the way governments at all levels do business:
they enable advanced communications for law enforcement, public safety, and emergency response
officials; make government more accessible (e.g., e-FOIA); and have led to innovative new means
of delivering a wide variety of services and benefits to citizens (including motor vehicle licensing
and registration, social security benefits, tax administration, and grants management). As noted
above, they also support continuity of the most critical functions of national government, including
command and control of the armed forces, foreign affairs, intelligence, crisis response, and national
criminal investigation and law enforcement.

Providers (ISPs) from liability when they act in good faith to block or screen offensive content hosted on their systems. Id. § 230(c).

As dependence on these converged systems grew, users and network managers became aware
of new types of vulnerabilities in the infrastructure. Moreover, the rapid emergence of the online
commercial environment, the growing monetary value of transactions, and the increasing volume
of sensitive information accessible online have also increased the online threat landscape by fuel­
ing the growth of organized criminal elements and other adversaries. Not only was it necessary to
protect the information content, it became necessary to ensure the confidentiality of information
as well as the authenticity of its sender and recipient.
Although these trends increased following the 1996 Telecommunications Act, they had already
been under way for some time. Thus, by 1998, as the scope of the risk associated with these depen­
dences expanded to encompass not only converged government communications and information
systems, but also the systems supporting national critical infrastructures, policy makers began to
recognize the need for an integrated effort that coupled the capabilities of government and the
private sector to mitigate these risks. “Cybersecurity”emerged as a distinct policy area. Presidential
Decision Directive 63 (PDD-63), signed in May 1998, established a structure under White House
leadership to coordinate the activities of designated lead departments and agencies, in partnership
with their counterparts from the private sector, to “eliminate any significant vulnerability to both
physical and cyber attacks on our critical infrastructures, including especially our cyber systems.”34
As these efforts matured, the White House in late 2001 augmented the structure by formally char­
tering the President’s Critical Infrastructure Protection Board, an interagency body with cabinet-level
representation from the departments and agencies and chaired by the Special Advisor to the
President for Cyberspace Security in the NSC who was“assisted by an appropriately sized staff within
the White House Office.”35 The board was charged to“recommend policies and coordinate programs
for protecting information systems for critical infrastructure, including emergency preparedness
communications, and the physical assets that support such systems.” This mandate also included
specific responsibilities to coordinate, in consultation with relevant offices, a range of functions
including: outreach to and consultation with the private sector and State and local government,
information sharing, cyber incident response programs and policies, federal government research
and development for information system security and emergency preparedness communications,
law enforcement programs against cyber crime, international information infrastructure protection,
and legislative recommendations relating to protection of information systems.36
This coordinating function continued until March 2003, when the White House dissolved the
board and its supporting staff function incident to the creation of the Department of Homeland
Security (DHS). The Homeland Security Act of 2002 (HSA) made the Department of Homeland
Security responsible for coordinating national efforts to protect critical infrastructure across all
sectors, including information technology and telecommunications systems. It also gave the
Secretary of Homeland Security wide access to information relating to threats of terrorism against
the United States and to all information concerning infrastructure or other vulnerabilities of the
U.S. to terrorism.

From an operational standpoint, the HSA transferred to DHS responsibility for managing the National
Communications System (NCS) as well as the Federal Computer Incident Response Center (FedCIRC),
which had previously been operated by the General Services Administration. Within months after
coming into existence, DHS established the National Cyber Security Division within its Office of
Infrastructure Protection as a differentiated component to manage the Department’s cyber security
policy and operational responsibilities.37 Shortly after creating the NSCD, DHS established the United
States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) as the successor to FedCIRC, to serve as the
principal cyber watch, warning, and analysis center for Federal civilian departments and agencies
and an operational point of coordination with the private sector for cyber incident response.
Homeland Security Presidential Directive 7, issued in December 2003, superseded PDD-63. It
reiterated U.S. policy to enhance the protection of the nation’s critical infrastructure, including its
cyber infrastructure. It further assigned the Secretary of Homeland Security the responsibility for
coordinating the nation’s overall critical infrastructure protection efforts across all sectors, working
in cooperation with designated sector-specific agencies within the Executive Branch. It designated
DHS as a the lead agency for the nation’s Information Technology and Communications sectors, to
share threat information, help assess vulnerabilities, and encourage appropriate protective action
and the development of contingency plans.

Other Important Developments
Complementing these statutes affecting the structure and economic regulation of the communica­
tions marketplace, Congress has also over time enacted various laws intended to protect the public
from abuses of these communications platforms and to facilitate their use in support of criminal
investigations and other law enforcement purposes. The Communications Assistance for Law
Enforcement Act (CALEA), enacted in 1994, amended both the Wiretap Act and ECPA. It further
defined the existing statutory obligation of telecommunications carriers to assist law enforce­
ment in executing electronic surveillance, including over wireless and digital communications
systems, pursuant to court order or other lawful authorization. CALEA was intended to preserve
law enforcement’s ability to conduct lawful electronic surveillance over emerging digital networks
while preserving public safety, the public’s right to privacy, and the telecommunications industry’s
competitiveness.
To address the lack of criminal laws available to fight emerging computer crimes following the
advent of computers as consumer electronics items in the early 1980s, Congress enacted the
Comprehensive Crime Control Act of 1984, which included provisions to address the unauthorized
access and use of computers and computer networks.38 Two years later, that was followed by the
Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 (CFAA). The CFAA clarified provisions in the 1984 law and
also criminalized additional computer-related acts, including theft of property via computer and
In the Post-Katrina Emergency Management Reform Act, Pub. L. 109-295 (Oct. 4, 2006), 120 Stat. 1355, Congress amended the HSA to
reorganize DHS, establishing an Office for Cybersecurity and Communications under a new Assistant Secretary. Id., 120 Stat. 1409. This
office incorporated NCSD, the Office of the Manager of NCS, and a new Office of Emergency Communications, which was also estab­
lished by the statute.

the intentional alteration, damage, or destruction of data belonging to others.39 The USA PATRIOT
Act of 2001, passed in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, and reauthorized
in 2005, provided a range of tools to support law enforcement capabilities to combat terrorism,
including enhancing law enforcement’s surveillance capabilities.

Conclusion
The history of electronic communications in the United States reflects steady, robust technological
innovation punctuated by government efforts to regulate, manage, or otherwise respond to issues
presented by these new media, including security concerns. The iterative nature of the statutory
and policy developments over time has led to a mosaic of government laws and structures gov­
erning various parts of the landscape for information and communications security and resiliency.
Effectively addressing the fragmentary and diverse nature of the technical, economic, legal, and
policy challenges will require a leadership and coordination framework that can stitch this patchwork
together into an integrated whole.
