The Danish Cyber and Information Security Strategy 

1. Introduction 
In December 2014 the Government presented a National Cyber and Information Security Strategy 
containing 27 government initiatives for 2015-2016. 

Since its formation in 2011 the Danish Government has aimed to strengthen protection against 
cyber-attacks while respecting the rule of law and personal freedom. In Denmark, citizens and 
businesses must be able to trust that important functions in society are provided both efficiently 
and securely. 

Digitisation, i.e. the extensive integration of digital technologies into society and the public sector, 
is a key element in the ongoing development of prosperity and welfare in the Danish society. It is 
crucial that the cyber and information security effort is professionalized and developed on a 
continuous basis. The digital infrastructure must be protected. This requires that cyber and 
information security is high on the agendas of management. 

New challenges and threats have emerged. Hackers have succeeded in disturbing functions vital to 
society, or they have been able to access sensitive and valuable information. It is the assessment 
of the Danish Defence Intelligence Service that ICT-related treats to private citizens, businesses 
and government institutions are growing. Cyber-attacks against digital systems have become more 
widespread and more advanced. At the same time, government institutions face challenges when 
outsourcing parts of the infrastructure which important functions in society rely upon. 

Denmark needs a strong protection against such threats as well as a strong reactive capacity. 
Extensive knowledge and understanding of the threats we face as a society is crucial. The present 
Cyber and Information Security Strategy therefore focuses on the need for more knowledge about 
security and the need for a professionalization of the day-to-day security effort of government 
institutions as well as cyber and information security in the telecom sector and the energy sector. 

It is essential that the effort is integrated into the existing organizational structure so that the 
professionalization of the cyber and information security effort takes advantage of the knowledge 
that the authorities have of the areas they are each responsible for. 

With the Cyber and Information Security Strategy the Government makes a significant step 
towards maintaining and reinforcing the confidence of businesses and citizens, ensuring that

Denmark is a safe country in which to invest and use digital services. Technological change will 
continue and we must likewise continually strengthen and adapt the security effort. The strategy 
will therefore be updated in late 2016 for a new period with the involvement of views and insights 
from interest groups, businesses and academia on how further efforts may most benefit society. 

2. Strong and cohesive security 
Digitisation is a global phenomenon that is rapidly changing Danish society at all levels. It has a 
strong impact on communication between citizens, businesses and government, and it influences 
the ways in which we arrange and organize our society. 

Digitisation is no longer a choice; it is a premise. Danish businesses apply digital technology in 
production and internal processes – and increasingly in their products. In recent years, the Danish 
Government has implemented a series of digitisation strategies focused on administration, 
productivity and cooperation, services and welfare. The efficiency and innovation potential of 
digitisation is crucial to Denmark’s competitiveness and prosperity. 

With digitisation being a key component of public services and the functioning of society, the 
Government emphasizes the need for constant improvements in cyber and information security. 
With this strategy the Government aims to raise its cyber and information security effort through 
systematic application of the ISO27001 security standard, employing threat assessments and 
reinforcing ministries’ ICT security oversight. Also, since much public ICT has been outsourced, 
services provided by external suppliers must be subject to a strong oversight. Security risk 
assessments of government IT projects is to be incorporated in the Cross-Departmental 
Programme Model and IT Project Model. 

These measures are aimed at ensuring the professionalization of government institutions’ day-today 
efforts regarding information security in order to improve resilience against cyber-attacks. The 
strategy contains several initiatives aimed at improving the understanding of threats and at 
systematically gathering experience from known cyber-attacks. 

The strategy is aimed at government institutions but it also contains initiatives aimed at owners of 
infrastructure of vital importance to the provision of energy and telecommunications to the 
Danish society. 

3. The challenge 
The cyber and information security challenges are both technical and practical in nature. 

Failure to comply with security routines. Part of the challenge is make government institutions 
ready to incorporate a systematic approach to information security in the daily routines. If the 
institutions do not set up the necessary information security routines and making concrete risk 
assessments regarding key systems the institutions risk overlooking security flaws and 
vulnerabilities. 


Dynamic development. Cyber and information security threats are ever-changing and there are 
constantly emerging new threats that require the attention of the authorities. There is no 
indication that this will be less true in the years to come, quite the opposite. The efforts to address 
threats must therefore be continuously improved and renewed. 

Cyber threats. The Danish Defence Intelligence Service 
assesses that Danish government institutions, businesses 
and private individuals are the targets of daily attempts of 
harmful activity from various agents via the Internet. 
While public authorities are rarely seriously compromised, 
the threat from harmful activities is increasing. The Danish 
Defence Intelligence Service believes that the most severe 
cyber threats against Denmark come from foreign state-
sponsored agents who seek to conduct espionage and 
steal Danish intellectual property and business secrets 
such as business plans, research results, technical knowhow, 
financial information and contracts. 

Insider threats. The so-called insider threats also pose a 
significant challenge. Insider threats include staff willfully 
or negligently breaching workplace security procedures. In 
this context, the threat of negligence poses a particular 
challenge – employees may inadvertently let unauthorized 
persons into the workplace by holding the door for 
strangers, or they may download programs with dubious contents. If the employees fail to observe 
security procedures, this increases the risk of unauthorized access to internal networks and 
therefore to sensitive information. 

Supplier management. The Government also faces a number of threats in connection with the 
outsourcing of ICT operations. Government institutions must upgrade procedures to ensure that 
external suppliers observe the security procedures. The importance of such procedures is 
illustrated by the severe attack against the IT service provider CSC in 2012. 

4. Stronger government effort 
The Government has already introduced a number of initiatives aimed at strengthening the cyber 
security of the state, and it is monitoring government institutions’ efforts. In particular, efforts of 
authorities with cyber security-related responsibilities have been stepped up. 

The Government has established the Centre for Cyber Security under the Danish Defence 
Intelligence Service. The main mission of the Centre is to support the reinforcement of IT systems 
and infrastructure which important functions in society rely upon against external cyber threats. 

Balanced security 

Information security initiatives must 
be adjusted to suit the diverse 
needs of the different government 
institutions and must reflect a 
careful balancing of security, 
usability and economy. The security 
effort should be proportional to the 
threat in question. Security must 
not be given precedence at all cost 
or unduly degrade the user 
experience and effectiveness of any 
given digital service. Security efforts 
must start with an assessment of 
the specific need for a given level of 
security. The individual authorities 
should therefore adopt a risk-based 
approach to security. 


Furthermore, the Government has established the Agency for Digitisation under the Ministry of 
Finance in order to combine activities related to state digitisation efforts. The mission of the 
Agency for Digitisation is to ensure professional and cohesive IT governance in developing cross-
public sector digital infrastructure. The Agency also advises government institutions on the 
mandatory principles of information security management according to ISO27001. 

The Danish police have set up the National Cyber Crime Center (NC3) whose mission is to prevent 
and investigate IT crime conducted online. 

Combined, these actions enable government institutions and businesses with IT systems and 
infrastructure which important functions in society rely upon to further strengthen their cyber and 
information security. Therefore, the initiatives in the Cyber and Information Security Strategy build 
upon an already improved effort. 

5. 
Strategic objectives 
Overall, the Government’s efforts to enhance cyber and information security efforts aim to: 

• 
Maintain citizens’ and businesses’ trust that cyber and information security measures of 
government institutions and providers of IT systems and infrastructure which important 
functions in society rely upon are professional and satisfactory. Meanwhile, efforts to 
strengthen cyber and information security must permit user-friendly and effective use of 
new technologies. 
• 
Strengthen the protection of important functions in society and national security against 
cyber-attacks. 
To support these objectives, the government has identified six strategic focus areas to be targeted 
with specific initiatives to raise the cyber and information security level of the Danish society. 

Professionalized and reinforced ICT oversight 

• 
Ministries must manage information security systematically and professionally and initiate 
strong ICT oversight of subordinate authorities. 
Clear guidelines for suppliers 

• 
Government institutions must set clear requirements regarding cyber and information 
security for suppliers providing IT services and infrastructure, perform regular risk 
assessments and follow up regularly on providers’ ICT security measures. 
Strengthened cyber security and more knowledge 

• 
Public sector cyber security levels must be raised and government institutions and 
business must have access to threat assessments and to advanced knowledge about how 
to reduce vulnerabilities. 

Robust infrastructure in the energy and telecommunications sectors 

• 
There must be a high level of cyber and information security within the energy and telecommunications 
sectors. 
Denmark as a strong international partner 

• 
Danish authorities must work with international partners to strengthen cyber and 
information security through active participation in relevant forums. 
Strong investigation and high level of information 

• 
Cyber-crime investigations must be strong and competent, and citizens and businesses 
must be given a better basis for adequately assuming responsibility for security in relation 
to their own equipment and online conduct. 
The initiatives aim to ensure the maintaining of adequate security levels and will serve to 
significantly enhance Danish cyber and information security efforts. It is however important to 
stress that complete protection against breakdowns, compromise and other security incidents is 
unattainable. 

Cyber and information security threats are ever-changing and efforts to ensure a high level of 
security must be continuously improved and renewed. Government institutions and suppliers 
must adopt a risk-based approach to security and embrace a focused and systematic approach, 
giving priority to the efforts that provide the strongest security balanced against the use of 
resources and the requirements for user-friendliness of public ICT services. 

6. 
Strategy limitations 
The Cyber and Information Security Strategy focuses on government institutions’ cyber and 
information security efforts and launches a coordinated and long-term government effort which 
must be further developed and supplemented in various state sectors. Professionalizing the 
government’s cyber and information security effort is essential to the protection of digital 
infrastructures which important functions in society rely upon. 

The strategy is furthermore focused on cyber and information security within the energy and 
telecommunications sectors where private companies own and support a large part of the 
infrastructure. The motivation behind this particular focus is that the telecommunications sector 
forms the backbone of communication in modern society and that the energy sector provides the 
energy required to keep modern society running. 

In parallel with this strategy, the Government, regions and municipalities have agreed to further 
increase information security efforts to protect privacy and to ensure a high level of security in the 
digital infrastructure at all levels of national and local government. The Government expects to 
extend this cooperative effort as part of the next eGovernment Strategy in which information 


security will be a focus area. The strategy is jointly prepared by national and local authorities and 
slated to be launched in 2015. The Agency for Digitisation, regions and municipalities will assess 
whether additional efforts are required with regard to the implementation of ISO27001 once the 
effects from the Cyber and Information Security Strategy may be assessed. 

The Government intends to update the Cyber and Information Security Strategy in late 2016. The 
update will be based on an assessment of the early effects of the present cyber and information 
security strategy, including follow-ups on each initiative, and identify areas where further action is 
relevant. The update will therefore include further relevant sectors in society, e.g. the financial 
sector. 

An overview of the 27 initiatives in the strategy is given below.
