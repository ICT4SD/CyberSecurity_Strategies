Introduction

In Turkey, the use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) has
been spreading rapidly and ICTs are playing important roles in all aspects of our
lives. In addition to public sector organizations, organizations which provide
services in critical infrastructure sectors like energy, water resources, health,
transportation, communication and financial services have also been heavily
using information and communication systems. These systems improve the
quality and the speed of the services being provided, thus helping organizations
work more productively, contributing to the improvement of living standards.
As our public sector organizations use ICTs to provide services at an increased
rate, it has become an important aspect of our national security and
competitiveness to ensure the security of information and communication
technologies. The vulnerabilities inherent in ICTs may cause denial of service or
abuse of service attacks, resulting in potential loss of lives, high scale economic
losses, disturbance of public order and/or threats to national security.
It is a fact that cyber space offers opportunities of anonymity and deniability for
attacks on information systems and data. The tools and knowledge required for
attacks are often cheap and easy to get, and it has been observed that anyone or
any systems across the world can participate in cyber-attacks, either knowingly
or unknowingly. And it is deemed almost impossible to determine who finances
and organizes these enduring and advanced cyber-attacks that target the

National Cyber Security Strategy and 2013-2014 Action Plan

5/47

information systems and data of critical infrastructures. These facts and
conditions reveal the asymmetrical nature of the risks and threats in cyber space,
making them even more difficult to tackle.
In light of this context, the Decision made by the Council of Ministers on the
“Execution, Management and Coordination of National Cyber Security
Activities” was published in the Official Gazette dated 20th October 2012,
numbered 28447 and came into force. Pursuant to this cabinet decision;
“In order to determine the precautions to be taken for cyber security,
to approve - and to ensure implementation and coordination of - the
plans, schedules, reports, procedures, principles and standards that
have been prepared, a Cyber Security Council has been established,
which is to be presided by the Minister of Transport, Maritime Affairs
and Communications and which is to consist of the undersecretaries
of the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Interior, National Defense,
Transport, Maritime Affairs and Communications, including the
undersecretaries of Public Order and Security, National Intelligence
Organization, Head of Communication, Electronic and Information
Systems of Turkish General Staff, Head of Information And
Communication Technologies Authority, Head of The - Scientific And
Technological Research Council, Head of Financial Crimes
Investigation

Council,

organizations that are to be determined by the Minister of Transport,
Maritime Affairs and Communications.”
The cabinet decision has also assigned to the Ministry of Transport, Maritime
Affairs and Communications the duty to prepare policies, strategies and action
plans on ensuring cyber security at the national level. All public organizations
and agencies, natural and legal persons, are obliged to perform the duties
assigned in the framework of the policies, strategies and action plans determined
by the Cyber Security Council, and to comply with the procedures, principles
and standards that were also determined by the Council.
The action plan which was prepared pursuant to this decision defines the
activities intended to be carried out within the term 2013-2014, and it also
includes the periodical activities beyond these terms as well as the activities that
should always be carried out such as training and awareness-raising activities.

Cyber Security Risks

The risks related to cyber security should realistically be determined in order for
the strategic cyber-security actions to be determined in the best way. With the
current know-how, the primary risk elements related to ICT systems in Turkey
are listed below;
1. The threat is asymmetrical as cyber space provides opportunities of
anonymity and deniability for attacks on information systems and data,
and the tools and knowledge required for attacks are often cheap and easy
to get, and anyone or any systems across the world can participate in
cyber-attacks, either knowingly or unknowingly.
2. Any information system can harm another due to the structure of the
cyber space that is open to integrated and uninterrupted communication
and due to the malware and other similar threat agents existing in the
cyber space.
3. Most of the critical services to the populations today are provided and
managed by information systems.
4. Most of the information systems of critical infrastructures are accessible
through the Internet,
5. There is a lack of national awareness on the subject, in spite of the fact
that cyber security at the national level can only be maintained by the
contribution of all the citizens,

National Cyber Security Strategy and 2013-2014 Action Plan

12/47

6. Lack of coordination amongst the partner organizations at the national
level in the field of cyber security.
7. Attacks in cyber space to individuals or public agencies go unreported due
to the fear of damage to reputation or due to other reasons.
8. The lack of national and international regulations about investigation and
prosecution of cyber security incidents makes it even more difficult to
cooperate,
9. The services of critical infrastructures are negatively affected not only by
cyber-attacks but also by potential errors inherent in information systems,
user errors or natural disasters, and there is a lack of capabilities necessary
to take measures against these kinds of incidents,
10. Public organizations do not have good enough information security
management infrastructures,
11. Public organizations and individuals do not have sufficient level of
information and awareness in terms of cyber security,
12. Top managers of public organizations do not have sufficient information
about cyber security or they do not seem to be sufficiently interested in
the issue of cyber security,
13. Public organizations are not sufficiently structured towards achieving
cyber security, and the issue of cyber security is regarded as a
responsibility of the IT departments only.
National Cyber Security Strategy and 2013-2014 Action Plan

13/47

14. The staff in IT departments do not have sufficient level of information
and experience in the field of cyber security,
15. There is limited number of staff who would be competent in investigation
and prosecution of crimes that have emerged as a result of cyber security
violations,
16. The auditing steps about cyber security are not included sufficiently in
the internal audit procedures of organizations,
17. Cyber security is not considered as an indispensable component of the
information systems which are procured or developed, thus cyber security
is not taken into account at sufficient level during procurement of
products and services in the area of information and communication
technologies in public organizations,
18. There is not enough national manufacturing in terms of hardware and
software.

Principles

The principles to be considered in ensuring national cyber security are as
follows:
1. Cyber security should be ensured by methods which are based on risk
management and continual improvement.
2. For cyber security, in addition to the technical dimension, an integrated
approach should be adopted that would involve determining strong and
weak sides in legal, administrative, economic, political and social
dimensions, including threats and opportunities.
3. Risk management should be based on the elements of removing technical
vulnerabilities, preventing attacks and threats, and minimizing the
potential damages.
4. It should be regarded essential that individuals, organizations, societies
and governments should perform all their legal and social responsibilities
towards achieving cyber security.
5. Full cooperation with the private sector, including the participation into
decision-making mechanisms, should be maintained for ensuring the
security of critical infrastructures,
6. It is regarded as essential that cooperation should be made with the public
and private sectors, universities and non-governmental organizations,

National Cyber Security Strategy and 2013-2014 Action Plan

15/47

furthermore, international cooperation and information sharing should be
ensured in achieving and maintaining cyber space security.
7. It is regarded as essential that diplomatic, technical and law enforcement
communication channels should be used continually and effectively for
international cooperation and information sharing.
8. International agreements and regulations should be taken into account
while the needed legislative actions are carried out.
9. The principles of rule of law, fundamental human rights and freedoms and
protection of privacy should be accepted as essential principles.
10. Transparency, accountability, ethical values and freedom of speech
should be supported in cyber space.
11.A balance should be kept between security and usability.
12. Auditing and regulatory organizations should take care of ensuring cyber
security in areas which they are responsible for.
13. Use of national products and services should be encouraged in meeting
the requirements of cyber security, and research and development projects
should be endorsed for developing these, and the concept of innovation
should be regarded as essential.

Strategic Cyber Security Actions

Overcoming the threats in cyber space which have been increasing every day
and minimizing the vulnerabilities within the national cyber space as much as
possible are of utmost importance for progressing towards an information
society which we have aimed to reach as a nation. Effective, high quality and
affordable usage of information technologies by all the members of the public is
important while evolving into an information society, but it is also very
important to achieve cyber security during the usage of these information
technologies. Therefore, cyber security, which is expressed as the protection of
information systems as well as the confidentiality, integrity and accessibility of
the information being processed by these systems, is a strategic and multi-stakeholder issue that would affect many aspects such as peace and welfare of the
society, the economic development and stability of the nation and the national
security of our country which has the aim to become an information society.
In this framework, it has been determined to perform strategic actions towards
achieving national cyber security in the 2013-2014 term, in light of the
principles determined above. These actions include sub-actions as required,
which are listed in the next chapter with the scheduled deadlines and the
responsible/relevant organizations. The strategic actions scheduled to be
performed in the term 2013-2014 has been grouped under the following titles.
.

National Cyber Security Strategy and 2013-2014 Action Plan

17/47

a) Regulatory measures
In the 2013-2014 term, the government will start to implement regulatory
measures, aiming to define the duties, powers and responsibilities of the
public organizations and agencies and to remove the existing problems in
achieving national cyber security. These actions will be of a nature to support
criminal law, civil law, administrative law and the regulation of all
procedural provisions thereto. Also, a dictionary on terms of cyber security is
to be prepared to prevent potential conceptual confusions.
b) Activities to help with judicial processes
Regarding cyber-attacks, in the framework of the international legal
requirements, the following should be determined to protect the rights of
victims; the source of attack, attacking systems and the severity of effect on
the end users who receive service from these systems. In order to produce
this information, the national cyberspace should be equipped with reliable
recording mechanisms that are compatible with the current technology.
c) Establishing the National Cyber Incidents Response Organization
In the short term, a Cyber Incidents Response Organization that will
efficiently operate both nationally and internationally is to be created to
quickly determine the threats emerging in cyber space, to develop – and to
share- precautions for reducing or removing the effects of potential incidentsthus public organizations and agencies will gain the capability to respond to
National Cyber Security Strategy and 2013-2014 Action Plan

18/47

cyber security incidents. “The National Center for Cyber Incident Response”
(USOM), which will be available 7/24 to respond to the threats that may
affect the country, will be established, and sectoral "Teams for Responding to
Cyber Incidents" (SOME) will be established which are to work under the
coordination of the USOM. The sectoral SOMEs will respond to cyber
incidents and they will also provide information and hold awareness raising
activities specific to the SOMEs affiliated to themselves and to the sector
which they are responsible for. Also other SOMEs will be established within
public organizations and agencies which are to operate under the
coordination of sectoral SOMEs. The USOMs and the SOMEs –while
responding to incidents - will also act in coordination with judicial authorities
and law enforcement agencies to provide the data that will support the
investigation. As the national contact point, the USOM will be in close
cooperation with the equivalent authorities of other countries and
international organizations.
d) Strengthening the National Cyber Security Infrastructure
In the short and the medium term, all public organizations will have wide
ranging infrastructure projects that will support the cyber security of public
information systems. Activities will be held for ensuring cyber security of
public organizations, with priority given to information systems of critical
infrastructures. The information systems of key infrastructures, their level of
criticality, their relations with one another and the responsible staff will be
National Cyber Security Strategy and 2013-2014 Action Plan

19/47

determined. The cyber security of the information systems of critical
infrastructures will be ensured by both technological precautions and
administrative measures and processes. To this effect, the proficiency levels
of all staff -on cyber security- primarily those of the top managers in public
organizations will be increased through trainings with administrative and
technological contents. The public organizations which do not have sufficient
proficiency in achieving cyber security will be supported with services to be
provided in technological and administrative aspects.
e) Human Resources Education and Awareness Raising Activities in the
Field of Cyber Security
In the short and medium term, activities will be carried out to create
proficient human resources in needed numbers in the field of cyber security.
Regulations will be created to include the concept of cyber security into the
curricula of primary schools, secondary schools, high schools, non-formal
education institutions and higher education organizations. Events will be
organized with an aim to raise awareness –on cyber security- of information
system auditors, technology developers, system administrators and all other
relevant parties, and to provide information that falls under their
responsibilities. Auditing steps on cyber security in the internal audit
processes of organizations will also be discussed. Also, an education
platform will be created for all citizens in order to create and develop

National Cyber Security Strategy and 2013-2014 Action Plan

20/47

awareness on cyber security, and initiatives serving this purpose will be
supported.
f) Developing National Technologies in the field of Cyber Security
In the medium and long term, technical know-how and the potential and
capabilities of the country on cyber security will be increased. Efforts will be
made to have public and private sector work cooperatively in activities
towards meeting the needs of research and development.
g) Extending the Scope of National Cyber Security Mechanisms
It is necessary to start working on extending the area of responsibility of our
national security organizations, to include defense against malicious
activities carried out in national and international cyber space.

National Cyber Security Action Plan for the Term 2013 -2014

This chapter includes the actions towards achieving national cyber security in
light of the determined principles for the term 2013-2014 in the framework of
the national cyber security strategy. The actions are grouped by the titles
determined in the fourth part of this document. One responsible public
organization and agency is appointed for each action, however, that action can
have more than one relevant organization and agency. In such cases, it is
envisioned that all the relevant organizations and agencies should act under the
coordination of the responsible organization and agency as required, and should
also act in parallel with each other as required, to carry out the activities
required by the action. The deadlines for some of the actions are determined,
and those actions which are envisioned to be repeated periodically and carried
out constantly are particularly specified. There are a total of 29 action items
scheduled to take place in 2013-2014.
