INTRODUCTION 

The Cyber Security Strategy 2014-2017 is the basic document for planning Estonia’s cyber 
security and a part of Estonia’s broader security strategy. The strategy highlights important 
recent developments, assesses threats to Estonia’s cyber security and presents measures to 
manage threats. This strategy continues the implementation of many of the goals found in the 
Cyber Security Strategy 2008-2013; however, new threats and needs which were not covered 
by the previous strategy have also been added. 

1. ANALYSIS OF CURRENT SITUATION 

1.1. Sectoral progress 

In 2009, a Cyber Security Council was added to the Security Committee of the Government 
of the Republic, whose main task is to support strategic level inter-agency co-operation and 
oversee the implementation of Cyber Security Strategy objectives. 

 

In 2010, by a decision of the Government of the Republic, the Estonian Informatics Centre 
was given government agency status. The renamed Estonian Information System Authority 
(Riigi Infosüsteemi Amet – hereinafter RIA) received additional powers and resources for 
organising protection of the state’s information and communication technology (hereinafter 
ICT) infrastructure, and exercising supervision over the security of information systems. For 
the purposes of organising the protection of infrastructure, the Department of Critical 
Information Infrastructure Protection (hereinafter CIIP) was formed within the RIA. In early 
2010, the RIA launched the critical information infrastructure (hereinafter CII) mapping 
project, which identified the dependencies of vital services on information systems. On the 
basis of the mapping, security requirements for vital information systems necessary for the 
functioning of the state were developed. In 2011, a CIIP commission was formed to promote 
public-private cooperation. The purpose of the commission, which brings together cyber 
security and IT managers from vital services agencies, is to exchange operational information, 
identify problems and make suggestions for improving the cyber security of the country's 
critical infrastructure. 

 


In 2012, the cybercrime investigation capabilities of the Police and Border Guard Board 
(hereinafter PBGB) were consolidated into a single department. In addition, officials dealing 
with cybercrime and digital evidence management procedures from various units in the 
prefectures were consolidated into cybercrime and digital evidence services that were 
established in prefectures in 2013. The PBGB is also engaged in raising awareness regarding 
cyber threats, which, among other things, has resulted in the creation of the positions for web-
constables. A web-constable is tasked with raising people's awareness about the security of 
the Internet and protecting children and young people online. The Estonian Internal Security 
Service strengthened its investigative capabilities in order to prevent threats to national 
security, including cyber attacks and espionage. 

 

The creation of the Estonian Defence League’s Cyber Unit (hereinafter EDL CU), which took 
place as a result of collaboration between the public, private and third-sector, has been 
instrumental in ensuring national defence. The expertise of EDL CU volunteers is applied to 
improve the security of Estonian state agencies’ and companies’ information systems through 
coordinated exercises, testing of solutions, training, etc.. The EDL CU can also be engaged to 
support civilian institutions and protect critical infrastructure in a crisis situation. Domestic 
and international cyber security training exercises have also played an important role in the 
development and assessment of cyber security capabilities. The Government of the Republic’s 
cyber defence headquarters exercise “Cyber Fever" and NATO Crisis Management Exercise 
CMX 2012 took place in 2012. Each year, the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of 
Excellence (NATO CCD COE) exercise Locked Shields takes place in Estonia. Since 2013, 
the NATO cyber defence exercise Cyber Coalition has also been hosted in Estonia. The 
Defence Forces has also created a Cyber Range to support cyber defence related training. The 
Range is used to carry out the aforementioned cyber exercises, organise domestic exercises 
and in the instruction provided by universities. 

 

In the field of cyber security, the main provider of training and awareness-raising is the 
Information Technology Foundation for Education (hereinafter HITSA), formerly known as 
the Tiger Leap Foundation. HITSA training is offered to pre-schoolers well as older children, 
while also involving parents and teachers in the process. A state-private partnership project 
was launched in 2013 to raise the skills and security awareness of smart device users, 
developers and vendors. In cooperation between Tallinn University of Technology (TUT) and 


the University of Tartu, the international Master’s programme in Cyber Security was opened 
in 2009, with 50 students accepted into the programme each year. In 2014, TUT, in 
cooperation with the Estonian Centre 2CENTRE, opened a Master’s programme in Digital 
Forensics. Estonia’s 2CENTRE Cybercrime Centre of Excellence is part of the European 
Union’s network of 2CENTRE competency centres, where professionals are trained in the 
fight against cybercrime, and continuation training is arranged for them. 

 

Estonia has successfully cooperated with other ICT-advanced countries and international 
organizations in the field of cyber security. An active role in shaping cyber security policy led 
to the establishment of the NATO Cooperative Cyber Defence Centre of Excellence in 
Estonia. Estonia has contributed to cyber security becoming part of NATO and European 
Union policy, and other countries’ interest towards Estonia’s experience in cyber security has 
grown significantly. Cyber security related cooperation has been successful on the regional 
level between the Nordic countries and the Baltic States, as well as with other strategic 
partners and like-minded countries. Estonia is also participating in newer forms of 
cooperation - the Freedom Online Coalition, the United Nations Group of Governmental 
Experts, the OSCE informal working group on developing confidence building measures in 
cyberspace, Friends of the Presidency of the European Union, and others. 

1.2. Trends 

The continued rapid development of information and communication technologies, 
globalization, the drastic increase in data volumes and the growing number of different types 
of equipment connected to data networks have an impact on daily life, the economy and the 
functioning of the state. On the one hand, this level of ICT development will contribute to the 
improved availability and usability of services, enhance transparency and citizen participation 
in governance, and cut public as well as private sector costs. On the other hand, the increasing 
importance of technology is accompanied by an increase in the state’s growing dependence on 
already entrenched e-solutions, and cements the expectation of technology operating 
seamlessly. In addition, the Internet is becoming increasingly accessible, the number of users 
continues to grow, and with new technological solutions and services - such as the "Internet of 
things", and cloud computing - the number of potential vectors for attacks, along with the 
complexity of attacks, is growing. 


Social processes are also becoming increasingly dependent on a growing number of 
information technology resources, and in the future attention must be drawn to the fact that 
society at large, and each individual in particular, will be able to maintain control over the 
corresponding processes. Otherwise, there is potential for information technologies to reduce 
the role of humans in the decision-making process, and processes may become self-regulatory 
(technological singularity). 

The main threat is cybercrime and its growth is reflected by the significant development of 
cyber criminals’ skills and their increased ability to carry out organized attacks. An integral 
part of the processing of crimes is the collection and handling of digital evidence, which poses 
new challenges to the procedural and digital forensics capabilities of the police. 

 

National cyber security is affected by the actors operating in cyberspace with their various 
skills, targets and motivations. It is often difficult to distinguish between the actors or 
determine their relationship to national or international organizations. The number of state 
actors in cyberspace that are involved in cyber espionage targeted at computers connected to 
the Internet as well as closed networks continues to grow, with their aim being to collect 
information on both national security as well as economic interests. The amount and 
activeness of states capable of cyber-attacks are increasing. 

 

In addition to the activation of state actors, the ability of politically motivated individuals and 
groups with limited means to organize their activities using social networks and carry out 
denial of service and other types of attacks is growing as well. 

 

Meaningful and effective cooperation between the public and private sector in the 
development of cyber security organisation as well as in preventing and resolving cyber 
incidents is becoming increasingly unavoidable. National defence and internal security are 
dependent on the private sector’s infrastructure and resources, while at the same time the state 
can assist vital service providers and guarantors of national critical information infrastructure 
as a coordinator and balancer of various interests. 


1.3. Challenges 

The main cyber security risks arise from the extensive and growing dependence on ICT 
infrastructure and e-services by the Estonian state, the economy and the population. 
Therefore, the key fields on which the Cyber Security Strategy focuses are ensuring vital 
services, combating cybercrime more effectively and advancing national defence capabilities. 
Additional supporting activities will include: shaping the legal framework, promoting 
international cooperation and communication, raising awareness, and ensuring specialist 
education as well as the development of technical solutions.. 

In the case of vital services, cross-border information technology interdependencies have 
emerged and securing them is no longer dependent solely on parties based in Estonia. The 
Estonian state has no option for effectively supervising services or parts of services which are 
provided outside of the Republic of Estonia . All vital services and their dependencies must be 
mapped, alternatives must be developed and operational readiness to implement them must be 
achieved. The preservation of data and information systems that are essential to the 
functioning of society must be ensured in both the public and private sectors. The timely 
detection of and response to cyber threats threatening the state, society and the individual 
must be ensured. 

Cybercrime undermines the functioning of the economic space, reduces trust in digital 
services, and, in a worst-case scenario, could lead to incidents causing loss of life. Competent 
personnel and modern technical tools are needed in order to ensure prevention, detection and 
prosecuting of cybercrime. Operational information exchange between countries is becoming 
increasingly important in the fight against cybercrime. 

To ensure the ability to provide national defence in cyberspace, the state’s civilian and 
military resources must be able to be integrated into a functioning whole under the direction 
of civilian authorities as well as being interoperable with the capabilities of international 
partners. In addition to conventional military environments, National defence planning must 
increasingly take cyberspace into account. 

In order to prevent and deter future security threats, it is necessary to constantly develop 
cyber security related know-how and to invest in technology. Implementing forward-looking 
procurement procedures is necessary to ensure production of reliable and competitive 


technical solutions and will support their export as well, whereas the knowledge and resources 
obtained in that process must be re-invested into innovative solutions. 

As a supporting activity, a modern legal framework must be ensured to provide complete 
solutions to the above-listed challenges. At the international level, the preservation of a free 
and secure cyberspace as well as Estonia’s central role in guiding and developing 
international cyber security policy in international organizations as well as like-minded 
communities must be ensured. 

2. PRINCIPLES OF ENSURING CYBER SECURITY 

1. Cyber security is an integral part of national security, it supports the functioning of the 
state and society, the competitiveness of the economy and innovation. 
2. Cyber security is guaranteed by respecting fundamental rights and freedoms as well as by 
protecting individual liberties, personal information, and identity. 
3. Cyber security is ensured on the basis of the principle of proportionality while taking into 
account existing and potential risks and resources. 
4. Cyber security is ensured in a coordinated manner through cooperation between the 
public-, private- and third sectors, taking into account the interconnectedness and 
interdependence of existing infrastructure and services in cyberspace. 
5. Cyber security starts with individual responsibility for safe use of ICT tools. 
6. A top priority in ensuring cyber security is anticipating as well as preventing potential 
threats and responding effectively to threats that materialize. 
7. Cyber security is supported by intensive and internationally competitive research and 
development. 
8. Cyber security is ensured via international cooperation with allies and partners. Through 
cooperation, Estonia promotes global cybersecurity and enhances its own competence. 


3. GENERAL OBJECTIVE OF THE STRATEGY FOR 2017 

Vision: 

Estonia is able to ensure national security and support the functioning of an open, inclusive 
and safe society. 

General objective: 


The four-year goal of the cybersecurity strategy is to increase cybersecurity capabilities and 
raise the population’s awareness of cyber threats, thereby ensuring continued confidence in 
cyberspace. 

4. SUBGOALS 

Subgoal 1: Ensuring the protection of information systems underlying important 
services 

The functioning of the Estonian state and society, the economic and social well-being of every 
person, their life and health, increasingly depend on the security of the systems and services. 
One of the main aims of the strategy is to describe methods for ensuring the uninterrupted 
operation and resilience of vital services, and the protection of critical information 
infrastructures against cyber threats. 

1.1. Ensuring alternative solutions for important services 

National dependencies on ICT infrastructure and e-services are constantly updated, mapped 
and managed. This includes a system of alternate solutions that are to be used in cases where 
the normal functioning of ICT infrastructure and e-services is disrupted. 

1.2. Managing cross-dependency between important services 

The mapping of significant cross-dependencies between services is kept up to date, the 
assessment of the extent of the impact of cross-dependencies on the functioning of services is 
conducted in a timely manner, and related risks are systematically grounded. Information 
relating to dependencies on critical services provided from outside the Republic of Estonia is 
kept up to date, the extent of their impact on the functioning of services is promptly evaluated, 
and associated risks are systematically reduced. 

1.3. Ensuring the security of ICT infrastructure and services 

Information and communication technology infrastructure is protected from modern threats. 
Critical data is kept and processed in highly secure data centres, and, among other things, data 
may also be stored securely abroad. Information systems necessary for the operation of state 
and vital services will be developed and managed in a manner that accounts for security risks 
and provides the means and measures to manage risks. 


1.4. Managing cyber threats to the public and private sector 

Information technology risks will be assessed and measured, with the requisite qualified staff 
available, along with methodologies, training opportunities and other resources. Areas which 
have not yet been sufficiently addressed are mapped and corresponding awareness programs 
are created. 

1.5. Introduction of a national monitoring system for cyber security 

In order to identify and react in a timely manner to cyber threats endangering the state, society 
and the individual, a national comprehensive monitoring, analysis and reporting system is 
adopted. 

1.6. Ensuring digital continuity of the state 

E-services, processes, and information systems (including digital registers of evidential value) 
that are essential for the digital continuity of the state are constantly updated and mapped, and 
they have mirror and backup alternatives. Virtual embassies will ensure the functioning of the 
state, regardless of Estonia's territorial integrity. 

1.7. Promotion of international cooperation in the protection of the infrastructure of 
critical information 

Protection of critical information infrastructure is enhanced through the participation in the 
work of international organizations, being represented in the interest groups of partners and 
allies, and through contributing to the professional development of experts. 

Subgoal 2: Enhancing of the fight against cybercrime 

The economic damage deriving from cybercrime reduces trust in digital services, and, in a 
worst-case scenario, could lead to loss of life. Greater awareness among the general public 
about cyber security risks helps to prevent cybercrimes. Greater awareness is achieved by 
addressing cyber-related topics at all levels of education and informing people based on 
research and analysis of secure behaviours. 

2.1. Enhancing detection of cybercrime 

In order to improve the efficiency of cybercrime detection and prosecution, the current 
structure of law enforcement and its organisation of work will be further clarified, the number 


of personnel dealing with cybercrime will be increased and the capabilities of bodies 
conducting proceedings to process digital data carriers will be raised. In order to develop 
capabilities, cooperation takes place with universities and international centres of excellence. 

2.2. Raising public awareness of cyber risks 

In order to raise the level of awareness of actors operating in cyberspace, attention is paid to 
introducing actions preventing cyber threats, providing the knowledge needed to identify as 
well as wisely respond to incidents. Users of e-services are directed to use the most secure 
solutions and are informed about new technologies and how to securely use these solutions. 

2.3. Promoting international cooperation against cybercrime 

In order to achieve more effective and timely prosecution of cybercrimes with an international 
dimension, information exchange between countries is improved. Active participation in 
various initiatives and projects that are part of the international fight against cybercrime. 

Subgoal 3: Development of national cyber defence capabilities 

Civil, military, and international cooperation based on the resources at the disposal of the state 
must also function adequately in cyberspace – with regards to warning, deterrence and active 
defence. 

3.1. Synchronising military planning and preparation for civil emergencies 

Broad-based national defence requires that the continuous operation plans of vital service 
providers are coordinated with national defence threat scenarios. 

3.2. Developing collective cyber defence and international collaboration 

To ensure collective defence in an international environment, information exchange and 
cooperation are enhanced with NATO, European Union cyber instances and other partners. 
Efforts are made concerning the creation and development of NATO joint cyber security 
capabilities, standards, training and training opportunities. 

3.3. Developing military cyber defence capabilities 

The development of military cyber defence capabilities will result in cyber defence being a 
part of broad-based collective defence. The latter will be ensured by involving specialists 


from the Defence Forces and the Estonian Defence League, as well as other public and private 
sector professionals. 

3.4. Ensuring a high level of awareness concerning the role of cyber security in national 
defence 

In order to raise the level of awareness concerning cyber security risks in the field of national 
defence and to link it with other military domains, additional training is organised for 
personnel in the field. 

Subgoal 4: Estonia manages evolving cyber security threats 

To maintain and improve its cyber security capability, Estonia will adopt independent cyber 
security solutions, which are backed by cyber security training and training opportunities, 
research and development and entrepreneurship. In order to ensure the sustainability of 
solutions, the state acts as a smart contractor, and supports the export of cyber security 
solutions. 

4.1. Ensuring the next generation cyber security professionals 

To ensure the next generation of cyber security professionals, opportunities for additional 
education will be established, both in the form of higher education as well as forms of in-
service training. Support will be given to raise the number of students having completed a 
Master’s Degree in cyber security and increase the number of doctoral theses on cyber 
security. Instruction will involve more foreign lecturers and professionals. 

4.2. Developing smart contracting for cyber security solutions 

In order to create secure solutions, the state will contribute to cyber security-related research 
and development. A supervisory board shall be set up to coordinate the corresponding 
activities and to consolidate the domains of national defence, security, economic development 
and academia. 

4.3. Supporting development of enterprises providing cyber security and national cyber 
security solutions 

To support the sustainability of secure solutions, the state will contribute to the export of 
cyber security solutions, and to increasing their use at the international level. 


4.4. Preventing security risks in new solutions 

In order to avoid large-scale cyber incidents, the technological risks pertaining to the 
development and introduction of new technologies are investigated and assessed in depth. A 
high level of knowledge and risk-awareness facilitate achieving advantages in developing the 
state, society and economy. 

Subgoal 5: Estonia develops cross-sectoral activities 

To improve the capabilities necessary for combating cyber threats, a number of overarching 
objectives are addressed. Adjusting the legal framework and developing cyber foreign policy 
are vital for protecting critical services, the fight against cybercrime, as well as for designing 
national defence in cyberspace. 

5.1. Development of a legal framework to support cyber security 

In order to implement cyber security measures ensuring a more secure cyberspace, the legal 
framework related to cyber security will be updated. 

5.2. Promoting international cyber security policy 

In international organisations, an emphasis is placed on introducing and protecting Estonia's 
foreign cyber security policy positions and vision, along with developing a common 
understanding on the application of international legal norms and confidence building 
measures in cyber space. Special attention is paid to the protection of fundamental rights and 
freedoms and the topic of Internet governance. In addition, development assistance and secure 
e-solutions support the emergence of free and secure cyberspace in countries where the non-
governmental sector lacks the freedom to act and the necessary technical base. 

5.3. Closer cooperation with allies and partners 

With a view to enhancing relations with allies and partners, cooperation is intensified with 
close neighbours and cooperation formats are expanded with like-minded countries. A 
significant effort is made to share cyber security related know-how and experience. 

5.4. Enhancing the capability of the European Union 

With the goal of promoting the European Union's common cyber security and its policies, 
joint efforts will be made to raise the cyber capability of Member States and to improve their 


readiness and ability to deal with new threats. 

5. PARTIES RELATED TO THE STRATEGY 

The Ministry of Economic Affairs and Communications directs cyber security policy and 
coordinates the implementation of the strategy. The strategy will be implemented by 
involving all ministries and government agencies, especially the Ministry of Defence, the 
Information System Authority, the Ministry of Justice, Police and Border Guard Board, the 
Government Office, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of the Interior and the
