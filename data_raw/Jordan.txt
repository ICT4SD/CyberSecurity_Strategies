1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
Jordanian Government organizations and private sector have different
approaches to ensure the security of their information systems and critical
information infrastructures. However, these approaches: are generally basic;
not systematic; subjective; have no clear definition or boundaries, are not
thorough; do not meet international standards; and do not deal effectively
with threats emerging from cyberspace. Moreover, cyber security efforts
across Jordanian Government organizations and private sector are not
consolidated and risks are not addressed at the national level.
The revolution in information and communication technologies, powerful
personal computers, high-bandwidth and wireless networking technologies,
widespread use of the internet, and the high volume of information
exchanged over the internet and local networks make it very difficult within
currently adopted approaches to obtain and maintain the desired level of
information security. The weaknesses in current approaches, coupled with
rapid advancements in technology place national networks at higher risks.
The nation needs secure and reliable national information infrastructures
which are resilient to malicious attack or arbitrary disruption to maintain a
high level of trust in these systems across government, with the private
sector, and within the citizenry.
Government of Jordan recognizes the challenges posed by malevolent
actors’ access to cyberspace. Reports of cyber-attacks and their impact are a
routine, daily occurrence around the world. Furthermore, while we know
what is known from these reports, the high probability of unreported or
unknown attacks or intrusions causes even greater concern. These
challenges require coordinated and focused efforts from all government
organizations and strong partnerships between the public and private sectors,
and with our citizens. Meeting these challenges requires all information
assurance and security plans and activities adhere to a nationwide strategy to
guarantee consistency and successful implementation of a coordinated and
effective cyber defense.

Information Assurance: technical and managerial measures
designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, availability,
authenticity, possession or control, and utility of information and
information systems.

This National Information Assurance and Cyber Security Strategy
(NIACSS) is not only intended to secure the Internet cyberspace, it should
provide a secure and trusted computing environment for all IT-related
infrastructure throughout all
identified national priorities

NIACSS identifies strategic objectives, national priorities, and an
implementation road map. The strategic objectives support the
Government’s vision for the path ahead. This vision aims to improve
information assurance and cyber security measures in Jordan. Supporting
national information security priorities address the critical needs required to
guarantee a successful and effective protection of the national cyberspace.
The NIACSS also considers the following important areas: Organization,
Technical, Legal, Capacity Building, and Partnerships. National cyber
security priorities demand collaboration within the Government, and with
international partners, the private sector, and the population.
The
implementation road map guides successful implementation of the identified
priorities towards achieving the strategic objectives.

This document is organized as follows. Sections 2 and 3 list the Scope and
the Strategic Objectives of (NIACSS), respectively. Section 4 lists National
Information Security Priorities. Section 5 outlines the Strategy
Implementation Road Map. Finally, Section 6 summarizes the overall
strategy.

2. SCOPE
The National Information Assurance and Cyber Security Strategy applies
to all information domains to achieve comprehensive information
security in Jordan. Although the government is the developer of this
strategy, a successful implementation requires collaboration among all
involved parties: government, international partners, and the private
sector. Efforts of involved parties must complement rather than conflict
with each other. Strategies and policies developed by the private sector
should augment, comply, and be consistent with this strategy.

3. STRATEGIC OBJECTIVES

4. NATIONAL INFORMATION SECURITY
PRIORITIES
To achieve the National Strategic Objectives listed above (Section 3),
Government of Jordan organizes its NIACSS across nine major national
interdependent priorities, each priority demanding collaboration across
Government, and with international partners, the private sector, and the
citizenry. Taken as a whole, these priorities form the action lines of the
NIACSS Implementation Roadmap. The nine priorities (not sorted in order
of importance) are:
1) Risk Management Program
2) National Computer Emergency Response Team (JOCERT)
3) Security Awareness and Capacity Building Program
4) National Information Security Standards and Policies
5) Legal and Regulatory Regime
6) National Encryption System
7) International Information Security Cooperation Program
8) Securing National Information Systems/Networks
9) Critical National Infrastructure Protection (CNIP) Program
4.1.
Risk Management Program
A Nation-Wide Risk Management Program
will establish the needed framework for high
level impact risk management on the national
level. It will not address individual risks, for
government entities and private sector, with
little or no impact on the national level.
Government organizations and private sector
must address and manage their own risks.
They must develop their own risk
management programs or plans that are inline
with the Nation-Wide Risk Management
Program.

Government
organizations
and
private sector will
develop and maintain
risk
management
programs that are
inline
with
the
nation-wide
risk
management
program.

In cyberspace, risks can never be reduced to
zero and there is no 100% secure system.
Page 7 of 20

National Information Assurance and Cyber Security Strategy (NIACSS)

2012

Therefore, understanding the magnitude and potential impact of these risks
informs organizational prioritization against limited resources. Proper risk
assessment and management in Government organizations will contribute to
business continuity and mission success. Organizations should assess risk
both qualitatively and quantitatively by identifying threats and
vulnerabilities. The likelihood and impact of each risk should be evaluated
against organization missions and assets to identify security gaps. These
gaps then define the true nature of the potential risk faced by the
organization against which leaders must decide either to accept the risk, or
take action to minimize or reduce the potential threat.
As no system is risk-free, government organizations should maintain disaster
recovery plans that are products of effective risk management programs.
Successful disaster recovery plans ensure organizations are back in operation
in a short time period after incidents occur. Government organizations must
adapt to the following strategies, for responding to risks, where applicable:
mitigation, transference, acceptance, and avoidance.
4.2. National Computer Emergency Response Team (JOCERT)
Information systems are targets for cyber-attack due to: 1) revolutionary

rate and e-commerce usage, and; 4) the
Team (JOCERT)
increasing number of connected systems and
networks.
Cyber-attacks increase the possibility of data disclosure, data manipulation,
data loss, and systems sabotage. These factors trigger the urgent need for a
National Computer Emergency Response Team (JOCERT). At its highest
level, the JOCERT helps the nation prepare for, prevent, respond to, and
recover from cyber incidents and attacks. The JOCERT, which will require
management and/or operational assets at national and organizational levels,
will enable Jordan to be better positioned to manage and respond to cyberPage 8 of 20

National Information Assurance and Cyber Security Strategy (NIACSS)

2012

attacks and incidents to achieve a higher level of efficiency and transparency
in dealing across government, with citizens and the private sector.
The JOCERT will coordinate with regional and international emergency
warning systems and should offer the following four kinds of
capabilities/services: proactive, reactive, quality management, and training.
JOCERT will deal with information system security incidents utilizing the
following methodology: receiving alerts, analyzing incidents, responding to
incidents, and announcing incidents, respectively.
4.3.

Security Awareness and Capacity Building Program

Cyber Security and Information Assurance Awareness and Training

responsibilities will have a higher rate of
success in protecting critical information.
Government of Jordan will develop these
programs in cooperation with the private sector. These programs should
have the following characteristics:
 Increases public awareness of cyberspace security issues and efforts.
 Addresses cyberspace security policy, tactics, techniques, and procedures
including response plans in the event of cyber-attack.
 Expands the government information technology workforce especially
those focused on cyberspace security.
 Involves and encourages academic and research institution efforts to
improve Cyberspace security education, knowledge and capabilities.
 Include a strong and well-balanced On-the-Job Training (OJT).

Develop National Information Security Standards and Policies
An authorized government entity, National Information Assurance and
Security Agency (NIACSA) (Section 5), will develop and or customize
nationwide cyberspace security overarching standards considering current

The efforts of implementing nationwide overarching standards and
policies will be assigned or managed by NIACSA (Section 5).

necessary guidelines and training programs to guarantee that related entities
can implement such standards and policies
Individual government entities and private sector that have different security
requirements will have the ability to develop their own security policies that
do not contradict with the nationwide security policy. NIACSA, Government
entities and private sector must co-operate to ensure that their policies
augment, comply, and be consistent with the nationwide policies.

Page 10 of 20

National Information Assurance and Cyber Security Strategy (NIACSS)

2012

A nationwide policy should be developed, published and communicated to
provide direction and support for information security per this strategy,
relevant laws, regulations and international information security standards.
The resulting information security standards and policies should be reviewed
at planned intervals to accommodate for the rapid change of the cyberspace
environment to ensure currency and effectiveness. Standards and policies
should have a single owner for development, review and evaluation. At
national and organizational level, officials and any other necessary party will
be designated to help develop, promulgate, and review standards and
policies. There should be defined management review procedures. Reviews
should provide recommended improvements or changes needed according to
law, and organizational and technical environments. The reviews should also
consider feedback from interested parties, status of preventive and corrective
actions, trends related to threats and vulnerabilities, reported incidents and
actions taken to respond and recover from these incidents. .
Information Security Policies should:
 Assign and define information security classification levels required for
the Government organizations.
 Comply with Jordanian laws and adopted international standards.
 Define organizational roles and responsibilities.
 Define policy distribution, training, and implementation timelines.
 Provide compliance and certification procedures, and approval
authorities.
 Provide procedures for corrective actions for non-compliance.
4.5.

Legal and Regulatory Regime

The need for empowering laws and regulations to support and enforce the
implementation of the strategy is a must. A specialized committee should be
formed with members from the Ministry of Information and
Communications Technology and Ministry of Justice experts to further
explore this area and provide recommendations.

Page 11 of 20

2012

Government organizations and private sector need to develop their own
internal regulations consistent and compliant with national laws to cover
information security-related legal issues.

Government organizations and private sector need to use encryption along
with other security measures to protect classified sensitive and critical
information assets. The following strategic needs list for Government
organizations will ensure investment in encryption today delivers strategic
value to national security efforts:
4.6.1 A national encryption policy will be developed, coordinated, and
placed in force.
4.6.2 Applicable international standards and best practices should be
considered for adoption for better encryption management.
4.6.3 Encryption should be applied to all data deemed sensitive or
classified.
4.6.4 Encryption should be considered where necessary when data is stored,
transmitted/disseminated and or processed.
4.6.5 Government organizations must ensure encryption is used in parallel
with other necessary security measures (defense-in-depth).
4.6.6 Government organizations must continually monitor or audit all
automated and manual actions and ensure procedures are in place to
guarantee the integrity and security of encryption capabilities and
associated logs.

International Information Security Cooperation Program

Jordan is connected to other countries through information networks. Cyberattacks can cause serious problems for national security. Therefore, the
government and all concerned must prepare to defend critical infrastructures
and respond effectively. To do so requires international cooperation.
Jordan needs to be part of an international effort to raise awareness, develop
and promote security standards and best practices, investigate and prosecute
malevolent users across borders, and negotiate and conclude bilateral and
multi-national agreements. The following actions support this priority:
4.7.1 Share and analyze information on vulnerabilities, threats and
incidents.
4.7.2 Participate in, utilize, and get benefits from current international
efforts, such as cyber war exercises and international cyber alarm
initiatives.
4.7.3 Coordinate investigations of cyber-attacks and other potential
computer-related crimes with international partners as required by law
and agreement.
4.7.4 Promote research and development and encourage the application of
internationally certified security technologies.

National information security cannot be achieved or strengthened to a
required level without cooperating with other international
governments, research centers, universities, organizations, and the
private sector.

Securing National Information Systems and Networks

Securing national systems should not only prevent security breaches, but
also detect and respond to possible attacks. Employing Defense-in-Depth

Defense-in-Depth should also be
resilient to accommodate rapid
change in the cyber environment. It
also includes a close examination of
personnel security, network setup and configuration, and operational
procedures. Security vulnerabilities across personnel, technology, and
operations must be considered throughout the system's life cycle.
It is through the combination of people, technology and operations which
provides the greatest cyber security posture. Tactics, techniques, and
procedures must be developed in the following areas to ensure success:
4.8.1. Personnel Security
Government organizations and private sector must issue security clearances
to users, system administrators, and any other parties using or accessing
information systems. Security clearance validation and renewal requires
appropriate management, background checks, and commitment of resources.
Also, cleared personnel require a “need-to-know” and integration in physical
security systems to ensure control and monitoring of man and machine in the
government information systems. Private sector will manage personnel
security issues under its control. Private sector still needs to cooperate with
the authorized government organization(s) to fulfill personnel security
requirements outside its authority.

Page 14 of 20

National Information Assurance and Cyber Security Strategy (NIACSS)

2012

4.8.2. Physical Security
Government organizations and private sector must employ all necessary
measures to deter, delay, and detect attackers or potential insider threats
from accessing a facility, resource, or information stored on physical media.
When the physical environment is threatened, appropriate response options
must be in place. Organizations should plan for this event, as well as natural
disasters, manmade catastrophes, accidental damage and other various
events which could damage the information infrastructure. These plans
should be tested and exercised regularly to ensure response times and
effectiveness.

4.8.3. Network and Communication Security
Government organizations and private sector must defend the
communications
networks,
critical
infrastructures,
networks
boundaries, and computing systems that they own through using
proper COMSEC and TRANSEC technologies, protection paths and
secure
alternatives.
National
networks
and
communication
infrastructures must be secure, reliable and available, they must
maintain the trust of government, private sector and individuals, and
should be resilient to malicious or arbitrary disruption and or
deception.
4.8.4. Software Security
Government organizations and private sector must ensure software
consistently exhibits required desirable properties even when the software
comes under attack. It should minimize the numerous flaws and errors in
software that are often located and exploited by attackers to compromise the
software’s security and other required properties. Software should be able to
resist most attacks and tolerate the majority of those attacks it cannot resist.
If neither resistance nor tolerance is possible and the software is
compromised, it should be able to isolate itself from the attack source and
Page 15 of 20

National Information Assurance and Cyber Security Strategy (NIACSS)

2012

degrade gracefully. Resistance and tolerance are relatively ensured by
having software manufactures a) adhere to software security development
lifecycle and b) constant vulnerability assessment, analysis of perceived
vulnerabilities, and rapid counter-measures or other configuration changes.
A certification and accreditation program should be established for all
critical software that will be used in government entities and business
entities that operate critical national infrastructure. Moreover, Government
organizations and private sector will follow national guidelines, standards,
rules and best practices needed to guarantee software acquisition,
procurement, outsourcing, in-house developed software, and Commercially
available Off-The-Shelf (COTS) components will deliver software that
commit to the national security rules and do not yield security breaches.
4.8.5. Procedural Security
Government
organizations
and
private
sector
must
ensure
information security related procedures are in place, wellunderstood, and successfully implemented. These procedures should
meet the set of regulations, rules, best practices, national information
security policies and standards that direct how an entity manages,
protects its communications and distributes sensitive information.
4.8.6. Electro-Magnetic Emissions (Radiations) Security
Government organizations and private sector must ensure that
sensitive information is not leaked through system electro-magnetic
emissions
(radiations).
Organizations
should
take
necessary
measures to protect systems having sensitive information and
prevent adversaries from exploiting this vulnerability utilizing
Tempest Devices, shielding, Faraday caging and or any other
necessary measures.

CNI support economic, political and social life of Jordan such that
any entire or partial loss or compromise of these systems may result
in a serious impact on a national level; or may be of instant concern
to the Government and people.
The government should regulate, co-operate and work closely with
those parties who manage, own, or operate CNI. The government
should engage with those parties in order to regulate and provide
security guidance in both of physical and virtual domains to secure
CNI.

5. IMPLEMENTATION ROAD MAP

Map document will translate priorities and objectives listed in NIACSS into
specific well-defined initiatives/projects. The implementation of these
initiatives/projects will contribute to realizing the overall identified NIACSS
objectives.
NIACSS calls for establishing a well-defined organization called National
Information Assurance and Cyber Security Agency (NIACSA). NIACSA
should be the focal point for all information assurance and Cyber Security
related issues and assigned the following responsibilities:

5.10. Organize and carry out evaluation attacks on national networks in
order to measure their readiness.
5.11. Be fully prepared to carry out preemptive and reactive attacks on
hostile networks and or systems.

6. CONCLUSION
Jordan Government realizes the threats imposed by the revolutionary
changes in Information Technology and the cyberspace environment.
NIACSS is presented as a result of the government’s review of the current
information security situation. Current approaches are basic, not systematic,
subjective, have no clear definitions and boundaries, not thorough, do not
follow international standards, and are not able to deal effectively with the
threats especially those emerging from the cyberspace. Efforts in this field
are not consolidated and risks are not addressed at the national level.
NIACSS presents the strategic objectives, national information security
priorities, and the implementation road map required to ensure and maintain
a resilient and trusted computing environment that supports national
security, enhances the economy, and builds awareness and trust of citizens
towards achieving national prosperity. The following nine major national
information security priorities collectively contribute to achieving the
strategic objectives and help to prevent, deter, and protect national
infrastructures against damage or attacks and minimize damage and recovery
time from attacks that do occur:
1) Risk Management Program
2) National Computer Emergency Response Team (JOCERT).

Those nine major national interdependent priorities demand
collaboration within Government, with international partners, with the
private sector, and with the citizenry of Jordan.

For implementation purposes, NIACSS calls for establishing a well-defined
organization called National Information Assurance and Cyber Security
Agency (NIACSA) that oversees the efforts required to implement the
NIACSS and its related projects. NIACSA is foreseen as a central national
entity for governmental and non-governmental organizations regarding all
information assurance and cyber security related issues.
