APPROVED by
Resolution No 796 of the Government of
the Republic of Lithuania
Of 29 June 2011

THE PROGRAMME FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELECTRONIC
INFORMATION SECURITY (CYBER-SECURITY) FOR 2011–2019

I. GENERAL PROVISIONS
1. The Programme for the Development of Electronic Information Security (CyberSecurity) for 2011–2019 has been developed considering the increasing significance of
electronic information, processed and transmitted by means of information and
communication technologies, and also considering the fact that the newly emerged
possibilities of electronic information processing fostered the development of national and
global information societies and facilitated further modernization of national economies as
well as led to more efficient public administration, while at the same time, with more and
more information being converted into electronic format and various public administration
and economic processes being automated, the global cyberspace and the public services
delivered online have become an attractive target for individuals, criminal groups, political
forces and other subjects.
2. The purpose of the Programme is to determine the objectives and tasks for the
development of electronic information in order to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and
accessibility of electronic information and services provided in cyberspace, safeguarding of
electronic communication networks, information systems and critical information
infrastructure against incidents and cyber attacks, protection of personal data and privacy, as
well as to set the tasks, implementation of which would allow total security of cyberspace and
entities operating in this medium.
3. The strategic objective of the Programme is the development of the security of
electronic information in Lithuania, ensuring cyber security in order to achieve, in the year
2019, a 98 per cent level of compliance of state-owned information resources with legislative
requirements on electronic information security (cyber security), reduction to 0.5 hour of the
average time of response to critical information infrastructure incidents and a 60 per cent level
of the Lithuanian residents who feel secure in cyberspace.
4. The terms used in the Programme shall have the following meaning:
Information resources shall mean an aggregate of information which is managed by
members of the information society and processed by means of information technology as
well as the information technology means used to process the said information.
Incident shall mean an event, act or omission which gives rise or may give rise to an
unauthorized access to an information system or electronic communications network,
disruption or change of the operation (including takeover of control) of an information system

2

or electronic communications network, destruction, damage, deletion or the change of
electronic information, removal or limiting of the possibility to use electronic information
and, also, which gives rise or may give rise to the appropriation, publication, dissemination or
any other use of non-public electronic information by persons unauthorized to do so.
Critical information infrastructure shall mean an electronic communications
network, information system or a group of information systems where an incident that occurs
causes or may cause grave damage to national security, national economy or social wellbeing.
5. The Programme complies with the action steps presented in the Communication of
the European Commission of 30 March 2009 “Protecting Europe from large scale cyberattacks and disruptions: enhancing preparedness, security and resilience” – COM(2009)149.
II. OBJECTIVES, TASKS, ASSESSMENT CRITERIA AND THEIR INDICATORS
6. For the purpose of Programme implementation the following objectives shall be
established:
6.1. To ensure the security of state-owned information resources.
This objective is being addressed, since no system for coordination of the management
of electronic information security has yet been created, except in the public sector (i.e. in the
institutions accountable to the Government of the Republic of Lithuania). The Ministry of the
Interior has no power to exercise a proper control and coordination for ensuring the security
of electronic information (cyber security), the governance and supervision structure at the
level of state and public institutions is not hierarchical, the lack of cooperation among
Lithuanian public and private sector entities prevents an efficient planning of the development
of the sphere of electronic information security (cyber security), the existing and regularly
detected vulnerabilities of information technologies, if not removed on time, give rise to the
disruption of the operation of information resources as well as critical information
infrastructures, while the efficiency of detection and removal of these vulnerabilities increases
through the centralization of said activities. The compliance with the requirements on
electronic information security (cyber security) ensures that information resources are
managed in accordance with the requirements of international standards and examples of
good practice, however, Lithuania has no efficient compliance management structure; the
information maturity model of an organization allows for a better awareness among
information resources managers of the need for information resources security and a more
efficient management thereof. The dependence of different state and public activity areas on
the use of information resources and services varies, therefore, in order to use funds
efficiently, it is necessary to consolidate efforts and information resources in the areas where
this dependence is stronger; the rate of criminal acts in cyberspace is rapidly increasing and
large scale incidents in cyberspace can lead to a national crisis.

3

There is no law on electronic information security (cyber security) and the regulation
thereof by legal acts of lower force is fragmentary and does not cover all members of the
information society, at the same time, there is no legal basis to allow an efficient response to
incidents in public electronic communications networks, the providers of electronic
communications and Internet access services are not required to report the incidents to the
National Electronic Communications Network and Information Security Incidents
Investigation Service CERT-LT (hereinafter referred to as CERT-LT). Consequently, the
instructions of the national CERT-LT for services’ providers regarding the elimination of
incidents are not mandatory either, there is no legal basis to regulate the use of identification
measures directed at reducing the risk of identity falsification and theft in cyberspace.
Often, the services delivered by providers of Internet and other information
infrastructure services do not ensure their users’ security. During the period of economic
hardship, electronic information security (cyber security) received neither sufficient attention
nor information resources, however, the application of the principle of collective security
would allow for a more efficient use of information resources; no backup information
resources or backup infrastructure to sustain the emergency operation of critical
infrastructures and information resources have yet been developed. Reliable identification
reduces the risk of major threats related to cyberspace and increases users’ confidence in
cyberspace.
Secure cyberspace (i.e. assurance of electronic information security (cyberspace)
security) is the concern of all entities whose activities are related to the provision of services
in cyberspace (public institutions, private economic entities, academic society and others).
Electronic information security (cyberspace security) projects implemented in cooperation
enable the achievement of protection of all stakeholders’ interests.
Cyberspace is a global space which has no national boundaries, hence, the rapid
spread of threats across cyberspace. The European Union and NATO devote much attention
to the security of electronic information and critical information infrastructure. It would be
appropriate to apply the principle of collective security not only on a national, but also on
international level. Cooperation among highly competent experts, exchange of available
information and experience is a prerequisite for an efficient early warning and preventive
action.
6.2. To ensure an efficient functioning of critical information infrastructure.
The objective is being pursued, since, currently, the security of critical information
infrastructure is ensured only on an institutional level, the coordination structure is not yet in
place, no analysis of relationship between objects of this infrastructure or the national impact
of its failure has been done, there is no planning of the continuity of activities. Penetration test
is the most objective method to evaluate the proper functioning of a security system, however,
neither a regulatory framework for its application nor a practice of such testing exist. An
efficient monitoring system facilitates the prevention of incidents.

4

6.3. To seek to ensure the cyber security of the Lithuanian residents and persons
staying in Lithuania.
This objective is being pursued, since not all users of electronic information are
concerned about electronic information security (cyber security), there is a shortage – and it is
likely to be felt even more in the future – of qualified electronic information security experts.
Basic knowledge and tools of electronic information security (cyber security) allow the users
to avoid many threats facing them in cyberspace.
To ensure cyberspace security it is necessary to establish a continuous and properly
managed system covering all phases of incident management, such as early warning,
prevention, detection, elimination and investigation. An effective way to fight against
malware spreading via remote control computer networks or other malicious cyber activities
is to block Internet access to persons and/or equipment engaged in malicious activates. The
current social stereotype is that illegal activities conducted in cyberspace are not punishable,
therefore, it is important that this stereotype be removed.
Cyber attacks launched from an overseas source can and must be stopped across
Lithuania’s virtual cyber perimeter in order to avoid their impact on the national electronic
communications network. The Lithuanian Internet Traffic Exchange (ITE) node, being a
naturally emerged entity, serves as a convenient and efficient centre for hosting protection
capabilities of Lithuania's cyberspace (as well as of its virtual perimeter).
Given the implementation of a one-stop-shop principle, the prevailing trend in the area
of electronic services is that of unification and centralization; it would be appropriate to
exploit this trend also for ensuring the security of these services. The users’ confidence in
cyberspace services is a major factor of the popularity and further development of these
services.
7. In order to achieve the objective specified in paragraph 6.1 of the Programme, the
following tasks shall be implemented:
7.1. to improve the coordination and supervision of electronic information security
(cyber security);
7.2. to improve the regulatory framework of electronic information security (cyber
security);
7.3. to expand and improve a secure national information infrastructure;
7.4. to promote the implementation of electronic information (security cyber security)
projects;
7.5. to develop international cooperation in the area of electronic information security
(cyber security).
8. In order to achieve the objective specified in paragraph 6.2 of the Programme, it is
necessary to implement the task of ensuring the security of critical information infrastructure.
9. In order to achieve the objective specified in paragraph 6.3 of the Programme, the
following tasks must be implemented:

5

9.1. to enhance the culture of protection of electronic information security (cyber
security);
9.2. to strengthen Lithuania’s cyber security;
9.3. to ensure the protection of Lithuania’s virtual cyber perimeter from external cyber
attacks;
9.4. to reinforce the security of services delivered in cyberspace.
10. The assessment criteria for Programme implementation and their indicators to be
attained in 2011, 2015 and 2019 are specified in the Annex to the Programme.
11. Taking into account the fact that the Programme covers one area, the
administration of which falls under the responsibility of the Minister of the Interior, no
allocation of EU-financed Programme funding among Programme implementing institutions
will be planned.
III. IMPLEMENTATION OF THE PROGRAMME
12. Coordination of Programme implementation shall be carried out by the Ministry of
the Interior (hereinafter referred to as Programme Coordinator).
13. Responsibility for the implementation of the objectives and tasks of the
Programme shall be with the institutions and bodies specified in the Annex to the Programme.
14. Institutions participating in the implementation of the Programme shall:
14.1. taking into account the tasks and targeted outcomes laid down in the Programme,
plan the level of the outcome to be achieved within the planned period, select measures and
plan funds and include them into strategic action plans and/or annual action plans and
annually, by 1 August, submit this information to the Programme Coordinator;
14.2. submit annually, by 1 February, to the Programme Coordinator information on
implemented measures and achieved results.
15. The Programme Coordinator shall:
15.1. supervise the implementation of the strategic goal, objectives and tasks of the
Programme, carry out an interim review of the tasks laid down in the Programme and changes
in the levels of task assessment criteria and, if necessary, initiate an update of the Programme;
15.2. present information on implementation and results of the Programme in an
annual Programme Coordinator’s Activity Report.
16. Preparation of additional legal acts other than referred to in paragraph 14.1 of the
Programme will not be required.
