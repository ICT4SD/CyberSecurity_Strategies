1.  The main prerequisites and assumptions   
    of the Cyberspace Protection Policy   
    of the Republic of Poland 

    In  the  face  of  globalization,  the  cyberspace  security  has  become  one  of  the  key  
strategic objectives in the area of security of each country. At a time of free movement  
of  people,  goods,  information  and  capital  –  the  security  of  a  democratic  country  
depends on the development of mechanisms which allow preventing and combating  
threats to the cyberspace security. 

    Due to the increase in threats to the ICT systems, from which the total separation  
is not possible, and the fact that the responsibility for ICT security is distributed, it is  
necessary to coordinate actions which will allow for a fast and effective response to  
attacks directed against ICT systems and services offered by them. 

    The  ICT  systems  operated  by  the  government  administration,  the  legislative  
authorities, the judiciary, local government, as well as the strategic systems from the  
point of view of the security of the State as well as entrepreneurs and natural persons are  
covered by this “Cyberspace Protection Policy of the Republic of Poland,” hereinafter  
referred to as the Policy. 

    By  this  Policy,  the  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Poland  accepts  that  by  its  
representatives it takes an active role in ensuring the security of information assets of  
the State, its citizens, and it executes its constitutional duties. 

    A part of the Policy includes the support for social initiatives aimed at implementing  
the tasks coinciding with this document. 

    The  Government  of  the  Republic  of  Poland,  in  fulfilling  the  constitutional  
obligations  implemented  by  cyberspace,  consults  organized  groups  of  society,  in  
particular  the  representatives  of  telecommunications  entrepreneurs  and  purveyors  
providing services by electronic means, to agree on an acceptable level of security of  
execution of obligations in question. 

    Accepting the status of the Policy for this document, it should be noted that under  
the  current  system  of  governmental  strategic  documents  a  Policy  is  in  the  group  
of  strategic  documents  detailing  the  courses  of  action  identified  in  the  strategies,  
development  programmes  and  other  programme  documents,  which  do  not  specify  
new priorities and activities. They set the vision of development for a given sector and  
the way for its implementation, based on the provisions of the relevant documents. 

    The Policy does not cover with its task area the classified ICT systems. It should be  
emphasized that the area of protection of classified information has its own regulations  
and appropriate protective mechanisms. It has the organizational structures dedicated  
to the protection of classified information produced, processed and stored in separate  
ICT systems. The main legislative act is the Act of 5 August 2010 on the protection of  
classified information (OJ No. 182, item 1228).

----------------------- Page 9-----------------------

    The Policy is at the same time a guide to actions for all other users of cyberspace  
who are not mentioned above. 

1.5. Establishing responsibility for the security of CRP 

    Due   to   the   international   nature   of   the   Policy   the   entity   coordinating   the  
implementation of the Policy, on behalf of the Council of Ministers, is the minister  
responsible for informatization who, with the help of the Team referred to in point  
3.4.1,  ensures  coordination  and  consistency  of  actions  undertaken  to  ensure  the  
security of CRP.   

    In the implementation of tasks relating to the security of CRP the Governmental  
Computer Security Incident Response Team CERT.GOV.PL is acting as the primary  
CERT in the area of government administration and the civil area. The main task is to  
provide and develop the capacity of organizational units of public administration of  
the Republic of Poland to protect against cyber threats, with particular emphasis on  
attacks targeted at infrastructure including ICT systems and networks, destruction or  
disruption of which could pose a threat to human life, health, national heritage and  
the environment to a significant extent, or cause serious property damage and disrupt  
the functioning of the state.  

    Similarly,  in  the  military  this  role  is  performed  by  “Departmental  Centre  for  
Security Management of ICT Networks and Services.” 

    For the success of the Policy, an active participation of users of CRP in the efforts  
aimed at improving the level of its security is essential. 

    It is also important to increase the participation of users of CRP in the implementation  
of  the  Policy  by  consulting  its  content  and  participation  in  the  coordination  of  the  
implementation of the Policy and its reviews with the representatives of society and  
ICT community. 

    The general use of solutions aimed at improving the security by the users of CRP  
will be an expression of approval for the actions undertaken by the Government of the  
Republic of Poland in this area. 

1.6. Compliance of the Policy with legal acts 

    The Policy is in compliance with the generally applicable laws of the Republic of  
Poland (the Constitution, acts, ratified international agreements and regulations) and  
without prejudice to any of them.

2. Conditions and problems of the cyberspace area 

     Functioning  of  the  State  and  the  implementation  of  its  constitutional  obligations  
is  increasingly  dependent  on  the  development  of  modern  technology,  information  
society and uninterrupted functioning of cyberspace. Currently, the safe functioning of  
cyberspace largely depends on the security of ICT infrastructure, which allows the use of  
cyberspace, information resources and services gathered in it, operating thanks to it. The  
infrastructure functioning in CRP allows the State to fulfil its constitutional obligation  
to the citizen, ensures continuity and effectiveness of government administration as well  
as uninterrupted and efficient development of the economy of the Republic of Poland. 

     Polish  government  sees  the  need  to  introduce  measures  aimed  at  ensuring  the  
security of the State ICT infrastructure, namely ensuring the correctness and continuity  
of  functioning  of  ICT  systems,  facilities  and  installations  used  to  implement  the  
constitutional duties of the State to the citizens and its internal security. For this purpose  
it is necessary to determine the minimum security standard which will allow for the  
implementation  of  this  objective  and  will  reduce  to  the  minimum  potential  damage  
which  may  be  entailed  by  attack  on  individual  elements  of  cyberspace  of  RP.  The  
Policy is the basis for developing the concept of management of infrastructure security  
functioning  within  CRP  and  developing  guidelines  for  the  creation  of  the  legal  basis  
serving the implementation of tasks in this regard by the government administration.  
The principles of ensuring cyberspace security developed under the cooperation referred  
to in point 4.4, within the infrastructure of CRP are also recommended to entrepreneurs. 

     The actions concerning the security of ICT infrastructure will be complementary  
to  the  efforts  aimed  at  protection  of  the  critical  infrastructure  of  the  State.  In  this  
respect, the  Policy does not affect the provisions contained in the National Critical  
Infrastructure Protection Programme. 

     The  Policy  indicates  the  need  to  develop  the  concept  of  ensuring  security  of  
infrastructure  functioning  within  CRP  and  prepare  legal  basis  for  performance  of  
tasks in this regard by the government administration. 

     The ICT infrastructure of CRP must be protected against attacks from cyberspace,  
destruction, damage or unauthorized access. 

     As a part of actions connected with the implementation of the Policy a risk assessment  
is carried out with regard to the identification of resources, sub-systems, functions and  
dependencies on other systems relevant to the functioning of CRP. At the same time,  
the implementation of the Policy will allow for the development of target guidelines for  
performance of risk estimates and model of reports containing general data on types of  
risks, threats and vulnerabilities identified in each of the sectors of the Polish economy  
in relation to the constitutional tasks carried out on the basis of CRP. 

     There is a need to develop, on the basis of the conducted risk analysis, the minimum  
safety  standards  according  to  which  the  identified  resources  and  systems  will  be  
protected, thanks to which the constitutional obligations of the State are fulfilled.

3. The main lines of action 

    The Policy will be implemented through the following actions, in accordance with  
the priorities resulting from the order shown. 

3.1. Risk Assessment 

    The  assessment  of  risk  associated  with  the  functioning  of  cyberspace  is  a  key  
element of the process of cyberspace security, determining and justifying the actions  
undertaken to reduce it to an acceptable level. 

    In  order  to  achieve  an  acceptable  level  of  security,  it  is  assumed  that  each  
government administration unit, referred to in point 1.4 (points 1-4), shall, no later  
than January 31 each year, submit to the minister responsible for informatization the  
report summarizing the results of the risk assessment (in accordance with the model  
developed by the minister responsible for informatization). The report should contain  
general information on types of risks, threats and vulnerabilities diagnosed in each of  
the sectors which an individual institution is operating in and is responsible for. The  
report should also present information on how to deal with risk. 

    Minister   responsible   for   informatization   in   collaboration   with   the   involved  
institutions  will  determine  the  uniform  methodology  for  performing  risk  analyses.  
There is a necessity for the use of this methodology to be eventually mandatory for the  
institutions of government administration. 

    It is recommended that the Governmental Computer Security Incident Response  
Team  CERT.GOV.PL  presented  to  the  minister  responsible  for  informatization,  in  
order to unify the approach, complied directories containing the specification of the  
risks and possible vulnerabilities affecting the security of cyberspace. 

3.2. The security of government administration portals 

    The main place for exchanging information between the government administration  
units and a citizen, in e-society, are websites. They should comply with the fundamental  
safety requirements, that is, ensure adequate availability, integrity and confidentiality of  
data. Each organizational unit should independently assess the risk (referred to in point  
3.1) for its portals. It is assumed that on this basis the appropriate (depending on the type  
of site and the results of the risk assessment) organizational and technical solutions will  
be implemented so as to ensure an adequate level of security. Due to the different types of  
parties and their different priorities, these solutions will differ from each other. 

    It is proposed that the government administration units running Internet portals,  
in addition to complying with the minimum requirements, implement also the relevant

----------------------- Page 12-----------------------

recommendations and good practices in the field of security, which will be prepared  
by the Task force for the protection of government portals in cooperation with the  
Governmental Computer Security Incident Response Team CERT.GOV.PL. 

3.3. Principles of legislative actions 

     The   basic   elements   of   the   execution   of   the   Policy,   planned   for   immediate  
implementation, are legislative actions. The Council of Ministers, understanding a high  
priority of these actions, notices the need for their initiation by the minister responsible  
for informatization in order to create regulations which give grounds for further actions  
in the implementation of the provisions of the Policy. It is necessary to review the existing  
regulations with a view to the preparation of solutions aimed at increasing the sense of  
security, not only of government institutions, but of all the users of cyberspace.  

3.4. Principles of procedural and organizational actions 

     An important step in the implementation of the Policy will be the procedural and  
organizational actions. Their aim is to optimize the functioning of CRP through the  
implementation of best practices and standards in this area. At this stage it is necessary  
                                                                                         1 
to use both the legal tools developed in the first stage and the “soft”  mechanisms of  
regulations. 

     Performance of this stage will take place thanks to the creation of separate specific  
projects. 

     3.4.1. Management of the cyberspace security of the Republic of Poland 
     As  a  part  of  the  management  of  the  cyberspace  security  of  the  RP,  as  well  as  
to  improve  the  process  of  implementation  of  the  Policy  objectives  and  to  ensure  
effectiveness of the State authorities in the field of security of CRP, it is necessary for the  
Prime Minister to appoint a team responsible for the preparation of recommendations  
concerning the implementation and coordination of any actions related to its security  
(hereinafter referred to as the Team).  

     The Team may be organized with the use of the existing potential of the Task force for  
the protection of government portals, appointed by the Chairman of the Committee of the  
Council of Ministers for the Digitization by the Decision No. 1/2012 of 24 January 2012. 

     It is recommended that the Team, within 30 days from the date of appointment,  
prepared  and  presented  an  action  plan  to  ensure  the  security  of  cyberspace  of  the  
Republic of Poland. 

     The primary task of the Team shall be recommending actions aimed at coordination  

1  A  soft  regulation  means,  for  example,  codes  of  good  practice,  guidelines,  recommendations,  code  of  ethics,  etiquette,  best  practices  or  
  standards, etc.

----------------------- Page 13-----------------------

of activities of the institutions carrying out the tasks imposed by the Policy, organization  
of regular meetings, recommending the proposed solutions for the security of CRP. 

    It is assumed that as for the implementation of tasks related to the security of CRP  
in the area of government administration and the civil area, the role of the main CERT  
is performed by the Governmental Computer Security Incident Response Team CERT. 
GOV.PL. Similarly, in the military this role is performed by “Departmental Centre for  
Security Management of ICT Networks and Services.” 

    3.4.2. The safety management system in organizational unit 
    In each organizational unit of government administration, as a part of ensuring  
the cyberspace security, the head of the unit should establish an information security  
management system, in accordance with the applicable provisions and best practice. 

    It is assumed that the public body will develop and modify according to the needs,  
and implement a security policy for ICT systems used by it for the execution of public  
tasks. While developing the security policy a public body includes obligations arising  
from the Act of 17 February 2005 on the informatization of entities performing public  
tasks (OJ No. 64, item 565, as amended) concerning the minimum requirements for  
ICT systems in the field of information security. 

    In order to ensure consistency of information security policies of organizational  
units, it is assumed that the minister responsible for informatization in consultation  
with the Minister of National Defence and the Head of the Internal Security Agency  
may prepare guidelines for information security management systems. 

    3.4.3. The role of plenipotentiaries for cyberspace security 
    The organizational units of government administration should define the role of a  
plenipotentiary for cyberspace security (hereinafter referred to as PCS). 

    The tasks of a plenipotentiary within the scope of cyberspace security shall include  
in particular: 

     1)   implementation  of  the  obligations  arising  from  the  provisions  of  legal  acts  
         relevant to ensure cyberspace security;  
    2)   development and implementation of procedures for responding to computer  
         incidents which will apply in the organization; 
    3)   identification and conducting periodic risk analyses; 
    4)   preparation of emergency plans and testing them; 
    5)   development of procedures to ensure information of appropriate CERTs about:  
         a)   the occurrence of computer incidents,  
         b)   the relocation of an organizational unit, contact information, etc. 
    The Policy does not indicate the location of a plenipotentiary for cyberspace security  
in the structure of an organizational unit, however, the role of a plenipotentiary should  
be assigned to the person responsible for carrying out the process of ICT security.

3.5.   Principles   of   education,   training   and   awareness- 
     raising in the field of security 

     As a part of execution of the Policy, the Council of Ministers recognizes the need  
to begin work on the implementation of educational activities. It is assumed that the  
actions  in  this  area  will  be  conducted  among  the  current  and  future  users  of  CRP.  
They are designed to reinforce the impact of the two previous measures, strengthen  
them  among  the  users,  and  create  the  possibility  of  passing  to  the  next  stage  of  
implementation of the Policy.  

     3.5.1. Training of plenipotentiaries for cyberspace security 
     In  order  to  improve  qualifications  there  is  a  need  to  develop  a  training  system  
for  plenipotentiaries  for  cyberspace  security.  The  project  of  trainings  should  place  
emphasis on the issue of responding to incidents relating to the cyberspace security. 

     3.5.2. Introduction of ICT security topics as a permanent element of higher  
         education 
     One  of  the  fundamental  aspects  of  ensuring  security  of  CRP  is  highly  qualified  
personnel working in the public and private sectors, responsible for maintenance of  
ICT systems with particular emphasis on resources crucial for the safety of the state.  
In  order  to  ensure  a  continuous  supply  of  well-trained  professionals  in  the  field  of  
ICT security it is necessary to involve higher education institutions in achieving the  
objectives of the Policy. The issues relating to the cyberspace security should become  
a  permanent  element  of  education.  This  applies  in  particular  to  technical  higher  
education  institutions  teaching  computer  scientists.  The  situation  where  designers,  
computer  programmers  focus  exclusively  on  functionality,  forgetting  the  principles  
of creating a secure code, and system administrators give priority to the availability  
of resources of users forgetting the need to protect the processed information from  
intruders should be prevented from happening. For this purpose it is necessary to take  
into account the issues of ICT safety among the outcomes of education specified in the  
                                                                         2 
National Qualification Framework for Higher Education.   

     3.5.3. Education of clerical staff in government administration 
     The Council of Ministers notices the need for education of government administration  
employees having access to and using CRP, in the scope of issues concerning the security  
of ICT systems – according to their positions and risks associated with them. 

2  Regulation  of  the  Minister  of  Science  and  Higher  Education  of  2  November  2011  on  the  National  Qualification  Framework  for  Higher  
  Education, OJ No. 253, item 1520.

     3.5.4. Social campaign of educational and preventive nature 
     The widespread use of systems connected to the Internet by the citizens and the  
increasing importance of the availability of services offered by cyberspace forces the  
necessary to raise awareness of the safe methods of using the Internet and to sensitize  
the citizens to the emerging threats.  

     Awareness and knowledge on how to prevent and combat threats are key elements  
in the fight against these threats. Only responsible behaviour of appropriately educated  
user  can  effectively  minimize  the  risks  arising  from  the  existing  threats.  It  should  
be  emphasized  that  in  the  modern  world  the  assurance  of  ICT  security  is  largely  
dependent on the knowledge and actions of each user of cyberspace.  

     Due to the fact that both individuals as well as public institutions, entrepreneurs,  
social organizations are at risk of crime in cyberspace, the campaign will be multi- 
dimensional and will take into account the necessary diversity of forms and content of  
communication, depending on the needs of its recipients. It is assumed that the public  
campaign will be long-term and widespread.  

     Due  to  the  ICT  security  conditioning  the  implementation  of  public  tasks,  the  
addressees of information campaigns will be, in particular, government administration  
employees and entities whose resources are included in the ICT infrastructure of CRP. 

     It is assumed that the educational and preventive campaign will be directed to the  
public, and in particular: 

     1)   children and youth – as the group most susceptible to influence. Education  
         should  begin  already  from  an  early  age  in  order  to  develop  habits  which  
         will protect young people from the dangers lurking on the Web (e.g. from a  
         phenomenon called cyberbullying – violence on the Web, making dangerous  
         acquaintances, obscene content, hacking, addiction to the Internet). Knowledge  
         about the dangers of cyberspace should be received by a child, in the first place,  
         at school at all levels of education (primary school, lower secondary school,  
         upper-secondary school). 
     2)   parents  –  as  those  responsible  for  the  education  of  successive  generations.  
         Parents  bear  responsibility  for  the  preparation  of  children  to  function  in  a  
         society, including information society. With the aim to effectively oversee the  
         activities  of  a  child  on  the  Internet,  parents  should  get  adequate  knowledge  
         about the dangers of cyberspace and the methods of their elimination. 
     3)   teachers  –  since  2004,  the  education  of  teachers  within  the  specializations  
         has taken place in accordance with the Regulation of the Minister of National  
                                                                                   3 
         Education,  defining  the  standards  of  teacher  education.   As  a  part  of  the  
         mandatory classes of  higher  education  teachers gain basic knowledge  in  the  
         field of information technology, including the safe and conscious use of ICT  
         systems. 

3 Regulation of the Minister of National Education and Sport of 7 September 2004 on teacher education standards (OJ No. 207, item 2110).

----------------------- Page 16-----------------------

    Social  campaign  directed  at  children,  youth  and  their  parents  should  be  largely  
         implemented in educational institutions of all levels. 
    The campaign will be carried out also through the mass media. Mass media – as an  
important partner in promoting security issues, CRP and popularization of projects  
contained in the Policy – will improve the effectiveness of execution of the objectives.  
With  its  help  during  the  implementation  of  the  Policy  it  will  be  also  possible  to  
carry out informational and educational campaigns. For this purpose, the national,  
regional and local media will be involved. The assumption is that as a part of the social  
campaign information about the ICT security and educational and organizational and  
legal undertakings within the Policy will be presented on the websites of the Ministry  
of Administration and Digitization and on the website of the Governmental Computer  
Security  Incident  Response  Team  CERT.GOV.PL.  At  the  same  time,  an  effective  
communication  of  content,  initiatives  and  results  of  the  Policy  to  broad  social  and  
professional circles is assumed. 

3.6. Principles of technical actions 

    On the basis of procedural and organizational activities (e.g. plan for dealing with  
risk), the last stage of implementation of the Policy should be technical actions. Their  
goal will be to reduce the risk of threats from CRP. Performance of this stage will take  
place through launching specific projects. 

    3.6.1. Research programmes 
    Supporting  research  initiatives  relating  to  the  ICT  security  is  essential  for  the  
effective implementation of the Policy. The formula of support should encourage to  
conducting joint research by the actors in the sphere of ICT security from the sphere  
of public administrations, research centres and telecommunications companies and  
purveyors providing services by electronic means. 

    It  is  assumed  that  the  entity  coordinating  the  implementation  of  the  Policy  
provisions  in  this  regard  will  be  the  Ministry  of  Science  and  Higher  Education  
(MNiSW), as the one responsible for the research and development work. The list of  
initiatives which take account of the dynamics of the state of knowledge will be defined  
at the level of specific projects, developed on the basis of the Policy and may be revised  
at the initiative of the competent bodies responsible for its implementation. 

    3.6.2. Expansion of ICT security incident response teams in government  
         administration 
    In order to be able to effectively carry out activities related to ensuring the security  
of CRP, including response to ICT security incidents, it is necessary to provide adequate  
technical facilities which will not only enable the execution of current tasks, but will  

Ministry of Administration and Digitisation, Internal Security Agency                        Page 15 of 24 

----------------------- Page 17-----------------------

also take into account the increasing demand for specialized ICT systems in the future. 

    All the teams, after the unification of responsibilities and response procedures, as  
well as determination of the constituency, would create a national computer security  
incident response system, which, in addition to cooperation, would also cover joint  
conferences, training and exercises. 

    3.6.3. Development of an early warning system and implementation and  
         maintenance of preventive solutions 
    The  ICT  Security  Department  of  the  Internal  Security  Agency  together  with  
the CERT Poland, which is part of the Research and Academic Computer Network  
(NASK), has implemented an early warning system against threats from the Internet  
– ARAKIS-GOV. Development of the system will be implemented in accordance with  
the specific project. 

    At the same time, bearing in mind the progress taking place in ICT technologies  
and  the  related  trend  of  emergence  of  increasingly  sophisticated  threats,  taking  
initiatives to promote the creation of more and more modern solutions supporting the  
ICT security is assumed during the implementation of the Policy. 

    The aim should be to use the widest possible range of different types of security  
systems to ensure the security of critical ICT resources. 

    3.6.4. Testing the level of security and the continuity of actions 
    As a part of testing the level of security and ensuring continues implementation of  
processes of CRP, the PCS should organize and coordinate periodic tests of both the  
level of technical, organizational protection and procedural solutions (e.g. procedures  
of continuity of actions or supra-departmental cooperation). The results of exercises  
will be used for evaluation of the current resistance of cyberspace to attacks, while the  
conclusions will form the basis for the preparation of recommendations for further  
preventive measures. 

    3.6.5. Development of security teams 
    The CERT-type teams are competency centres offering substantive help at the stage  
of creating appropriate structures and procedures. In addition, they are also used to  
solve problems during their operation in various organizational units of government  
administration or of entrepreneurs. Each institution, within own personal resources  
and  technical  means  available,  may  establish  its  own  local  incident  response  team  
whose operation is coordinated in accordance with point 4.2.  

    Moreover,  the  tasks  of  Computer  Security  Incident  Response  Teams  should  
include maintaining internal informational sites. The sites will be the main sources of  
information about the ICT security for people involved in ICT security in government  
administration institutions, as well as other persons interested in this subject.

----------------------- Page 18-----------------------

     In particular, the site will be a place for publication of the following information: 

     1)   news related to ICT security; 
     2)   information about potential risks and threats; 
     3)   security bulletins; 
     4)   different types of guides, best practices;  
     5)   reports and information on the trends and statistics; 
     6)   forum  for  the  exchange  of  information  and  experience  of  those  involved  in  
         activities related to ICT security. 
     The sites will function as points for reporting ICT security incidents. A site will be  
designed so that users without much computer knowledge can report the incident or  
find information where to report the incident.

4.  Implementation   and   delivery   mechanisms   of   the  
    provisions of the document 

    It is assumed that the objectives and principles of the Policy will be executed taking  
into account risk assessment and implemented within the specific projects. 

4.1. Supervision and coordination of the implementation 

    Due to the international nature of the Policy the body supervising its implementation  
is the Council of Ministers. The entity coordinating the implementation of the Policy,  
on behalf of the Council of Ministers, is the minister responsible for informatization. 

4.2. The National Response System for Computer Security  
    Incidents in CRP 

    The  government  of  the  Republic  of  Poland  establishes  a  three-level  National  
Response System for Computer Security Incidents in CRP: 

    1)   Level I – the level of coordination – the minister responsible for informatization; 
    2)   Level II – computer incident response: 
    a)   the Governmental Computer Security Incident Response Team CERT.GOV.PL  
        – at the same time performing the tasks of the main national team responsible  
        for coordinating the process of handling computer incidents in CRP, 
    b)   Departmental Centre for Security Management of ICT Networks and Services  
        performing tasks in the military sphere, 
    3)   Level  III  –  the  level  of  implementation  –  administrators  responsible  for  
        individual ICT systems operating in cyberspace. 
    The established response system ensures the exchange of information between teams  
of government administration and CERTs (CERT Poland, TP CERT, PIONIERCERT),  
CSIRT,  ABUSE,  telecommunications  companies,  within  the  meaning  of  the  Act  of  
16 July 2004 – Telecommunications Law (OJ No. 171, item 1800, as amended), and  
purveyors providing services by electronic means, within the meaning of the Act of  
18  July  2002  on  providing  services  by  electronic  means  (OJ  No.  144,  item  1204,  as  
amended), in accordance with applicable laws, and in particular in accordance with  
the Act of 29 August 1997 on the protection of personal data (OJ of 2002, No. 101,  
item 926, as amended) and the Act of 5 August 2010 on the protection of classified  
information (OJ No. 182, item 1228).

----------------------- Page 20-----------------------

4.3. Information exchange mechanism 

    An efficient system of coordination will ensure the exchange of information gained  
from the international cooperation between the governmental, military and civilian  
teams, in accordance with applicable law, and in particular in accordance with the Act  
of 29 August 1997 on the protection of personal data (OJ of 2002, No. 101, item 926,  
as amended) and the Act of 5 August 2010 on the protection of classified information  
(OJ No. 182, item 1228).  

    This system will, among other things, identify alternative channels for the exchange  
of  information  and  introduce  periodic  tests  of  effectiveness  of  the  information  
exchange processes. 

4.4. Methods and forms of cooperation 

    As  a  part  of  implementation  of  the  Policy,  forms  of  cooperation  between  the  
authorities  responsible  for  the  security  of  cyberspace  and  responsible  for  combating  
computer crime of criminal nature should be developed. These forms of cooperation will  
have both a working form, in order to minimize delays of computer incident response, as  
well as a formalized form – serving the elimination of jurisdiction problems. 

4.5. Cooperation with entrepreneurs 

    It  is  essential  to  activate  entrepreneurs  whose  protection  from  the  cyberspace  
threats is important from the point of view of the proper functioning of the State. 

    This group should include entrepreneurs active in particular in the following sectors: 

     1)   supply in energy, energy resources and fuel, 
    2)   communications, 
    3)   ICT networks, 
    4)   finances, 
    5)   transport. 
    The   Policy   assumes   taking   up   actions   activating   the   cooperation   between  
entrepreneurs   managing   their   own   ICT   infrastructure,   falling   within   the   ICT  
infrastructure  of  CRP  of  a  similar  nature,  and  thus  exposed  to  similar  types  of  
vulnerabilities and methods of attacks. One of the forms of cooperation will be the  
creation of bodies appointed for the internal exchange of information and experiences  
and  the  cooperation  with  the  public  administration  in  the  field  of  security  of  ICT  
infrastructure of CRP.

----------------------- Page 21-----------------------

    4.5.1. Cooperation with manufacturers of ICT equipment and systems 
    Important  partners  for  government  institutions  and  other  entities  responsible  
for the ICT security and increasing the security in cyberspace are manufacturers of  
hardware and software. Development of cooperation with these partners, including  
the exchange of experiences and expectations, should be one of the most important  
factors which significantly influence the public and specialist education system, as well  
as the quality of the created systems. The cooperation of entities responsible for the ICT  
security with manufacturers of security systems should be of particular importance for  
the expansion of the spectrum of available tools.  

     The aim should be to provide the users with the largest range of solutions for the  
broadly understood ICT security and protection of information.  

    4.5.2. Cooperation with telecommunication entrepreneurs 
    Due to the global nature of threats, a close, coordinated cooperation in the field  
of  cyberspace  security  between  the  Office  of  Electronic  Communications  (UKE),  
telecommunication companies and the users of CRP is required. 

4.6. International cooperation 

    Due  to  the  global  nature  of  the  problems  related  to  cyberspace  security,  an  
important element is to maintain and develop international cooperation in this regard.  

    The government of the Republic of Poland recognizes the need for Poland, through  
its  representatives,  government  agencies,  public  institutions  and  cooperation  with  
non-governmental  institutions,  to  initiate  and  conduct  active  steps  to  increase  the  
security of CRP and the international security.

----------------------- Page 22-----------------------

5. Financing 

     The Policy will not imply additional resources from the state budget to finance the  
assumed activities in the year of its entry into force, because the current organizational  
units of government administration have been already partially fulfilling the objectives  
set out in the Policy. Therefore, it is assumed that after its approval each organizational  
unit  will  clearly  indicate  the  tasks  already  performed  and  the  expended  financial  
resources.  

     This document assumes the continuation of the activities carried out and planned  
by the Team referred to in point 3.4.1.  

     It  is  assumed  that  since  the  entry  into  force  of  the  Policy  individual  units  are  
estimating the costs of the implemented tasks corresponding to the tasks imposed by  
this Policy.  

     The presented estimates of costs will allow for their inclusion in the plan of the  
following fiscal year with a clear indication that they relate to cyberspace security.  

     Individual organizational units transmit data on the costs of implementation of  
tasks estimated by them to the minister responsible for informatization. The costs of  
the implementation of tasks will be determined by the results of the risk assessment  
and  presented  in  specific  projects  with  ascribing  them  to  individual  units  and  an  
indication of the sources of funding.  

     Necessary expenses related to the implementation of the  Policy will be financed  
within  the  limit  of  budgetary  expenditure  provided  for  in  the  relevant  part  of  the  
budget in the budget act for a given year.

6. Assessment of effectiveness of the Policy 

    Due to the innovative nature of this document, detailed indicators of implementation  
of the provisions of the Policy will be developed following the risk assessment.  

    It is essential, from the entry into force of the Policy, for individual organizational  
units to analyse and suggest indicators of the implementation of tasks on whose basis  
information will be aggregated and global indicators of the objectives of this document  
will be developed. It is assumed that the presented proposals of global indicators will be  
used in updating the Policy and allow for assessment of the degree of implementation  
of the planned objectives and tasks related to the security of CRP.  

    The  degree  of  implementation  of  projects  related  to  the  implementation  of  the  
strategic  objective  and  specific  objectives  of  the  Policy  will  be  evaluated  within  the  
specific projects by the following criteria:  

     1)   the degree of saturation of all organizational units which have security systems  
         and early warning systems in relation to the number of public administration  
         employees; 
    2)   the level of integration: 
         a)   the method and procedure for the exchange of information between teams,  
             ensuring confidentiality, integrity and availability, 
         b)   the possibilities for and scope of achieving a common, dynamic imagery of  
             cyberspace covered by this Policy, 
    3)   the degree of standardization – the degree of implementation of the standards,  
         categories of incidents and procedures; 
    4)   the degree of equipping the systems in a comprehensive anti-virus software,  
         firewalls, anti-spam with relation to those requiring protection (identification  
         of resources). 
    The  following  measures  will  be  used  to  evaluate  the  effectiveness  of  specific  
projects, created on the basis of this Policy: 

1.   Effectiveness measures – measure the degree of achieving the objectives and can be  
    applied at all levels of task classification. 
Sample effectiveness measure:  

–   the  number  of  closed  incidents  in  relation  to  the  total  number  of  categorized  
    incidents. 

2.    Product measures – reflect performance of a given task in a short period and show  
    specific  goods  and  services  produced  by  the  public  sector.  Product  measures  –  
    measure the degree of implementation of operational objectives.  
Sample product measures:  

–   the number of responses to incidents reported by citizens,

–   the number of handled incidents. 

3.    Result  measures  –  measure  the  effects  achieved  through  the  actions  included  in  
    a task or under a task, carried out by the appropriate expenditure, at the level of  
    task/subtask/action. Measure the results of undertaken actions. Result measures –  
    measure direct effects of undertaken actions in the short or medium term.  
Sample result measures:  

–   shortening the time of handling an incident, 
–   the average response time to an incident.  

4.  Impact  measures  –  measure  the  long-term  consequences  of  implementation  of  a  
    task. They can measure the direct effects of the implementation of a task which  
    become apparent after a long period of time. Sometimes, the impact measures refer  
    to the values which are only partially the result of the implementation of a task (the  
    results are also affected by other external factors).  
Sample impact measure: 

–   the increase of the sense of security on the Internet in Poland (research of CBOS –  
    Public Opinion Research Centre). The degree of implementation will be assessed  
    in percentage, while 100% means the implementation of all the tasks under specific  
    projects developed on the basis of the Policy. 
Within one year from the entry into force of the Policy, each involved entity, referred  
to in point 1.4. paragraph 1 of this document, shall estimate (in %) to what extent the  
principles of the Policy have been already achieved. 

6.1. Expected effects of the Policy 

    The following long-term effects of actions resulting from the implementation of  
this Policy and specific projects developed on its basis are expected: 

–   a higher level of security of CRP and a higher level of resistance of the state to  
    attacks in CRP, 
–   a policy concerning the cyberspace security consistent for all the involved agents, 
–   lower  effectiveness  of  terrorist  attacks  in  CRP  and  lower  costs  of  removing  the  
    results of cyberterrorist attacks, 
–   effective  system  of  coordination  and  exchange  of  information  between  public  
    and private entities responsible for ensuring the security of cyberspace and those  
    administering the resources constituting the critical ICT infrastructure of the state, 
–   greater  competence  of  actors  involved  in  the  ICT  infrastructure  security  of  the  
    State functioning in cyberspace,

–   greater  confidence  of  the  citizens  in  the  proper  protection  of  the  state  services  
    provided by electronic means, 
–   greater  public  awareness  as  to  the  methods  of  the  safe  use  of  systems  available  
    electronically and ICT networks. 

6.2. Effectiveness of actions 

    The measure of effectiveness of actions undertaken as a part of the Policy will be  
the  assessment  of  the  created  regulations,  institutions  and  relationships  which  will  
enable the actual existence of an effective cyberspace security system. One of the basic  
methods of influencing the effectiveness of the planned activities performed by many  
institutions is to establish the scope of tasks of each of the entities and to determine the  
responsibility for their implementation. 

6.3. Monitoring the effectiveness of actions as a part of  
    the adopted Policy 

    Reports on the progress of implementation of the Policy will be sent by the bodies  
mentioned in point 1.4 to the minister responsible for informatization. 

6.4. Consequences of violating the provisions of the Policy  

    Each government administration entity shall apply the provisions of this Policy,  
regardless of liability specified in the provisions of generally applicable law. 

    Violation of the rules set out in this Policy may result in the exclusion of the entity  
from the information society and emergence of barriers in access to public information.  
Adequate protection, security of the processed data and reliability of the ICT systems  
are the highest values faced by the modern systems. Entities implementing the Policy  
in question should indicate ways for securing information systems, procedures for the  
ICT security breach in information systems in security policies of these systems. The  
implementation of the provisions of this document is to provide an adequate response,  
evaluation and documentation of cases of the system security breaches and ensure an  
appropriate way of responding to incidents in order to restore an acceptable level of  
security.  An  important  obligation  is  to  immediately  inform  an  administrator  or  an  
appropriate CERT about detected incidents and take or refrain from actions aimed at  
handling them.
