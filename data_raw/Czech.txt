Introduction 

 

 

Strategy of the Czech Republic in the field of cybernetic security for 2012 – 
2015 (hereinafter referred to as “Strategy”) is one of the steps of the Government of 
the Czech Republic in reaction to worldwide rise of cybernetic threats. The Strategy 
stems from efforts of governmental and non-governmental entities to raise level of 
cybernetic security. It brings initiatives to enhance cybernetic security for state 
bodies, critical infrastructure and commercial sphere as well as for citizens. 

The Strategy defines aims and interests of the Czech Republic in the field of 
cybernetic security for building of reliable information society and is in line with the 
Security Strategy of the Czech Republic. 

This Strategy is the basic document for the creation of legal acts, security 
policies of information and communication systems, standards, rules, operation 
measures, maintenance plans, recommendations and other tools for cybernetic 
security. 

The Strategy is divided into three parts. The first one describes foundations 
determining necessity to deal with this problem. The second one brings analysis and 
basic principles of cybernetic security. The third states goals and describes activities 
crucial for enhancing cybernetic security – activities implemented by the Government 
of the Czech Republic and activities in cooperation with partners. 


I. Foundations 

 

Attacks on critical information infrastructure have become more often, complex 
and sophisticated as the perpetrators are more professional in the recent years. 
Possibilities for timely reaction and arrests of perpetrators are very limited and 
demanding. The trend of the development of ISs for industrial use connected to the 
internet brings new vulnerabilities of those systems. Experience with Stuxnet virus 
shows that important industrial facilities are not immune to cybernetic attacks. Cyber 
security shall remain crucial for maintaining functioning state in the future. 

 

Information and communication technologies and their impact on modern 
society and economics 

Safe and sound functioning if information and communication technologies 
(hereinafter “ICT”) is necessary for operations of state and public entities and is one 
of the basic preconditions of prosperity and sustainable economic growth. The share 
of human activity dependent directly or indirectly on ICT is steadily growing. The 
Czech Republic has ambitions to belong among developed countries in this field. 
Networks and online services have to be not only secure but also reliable. The whole 
society has to enhance its activities towards the security and reliability of ICT. 

 

ICT and societies dependent on them are vulnerable 

Constant and rapid progress in the field of ICT brings new opportunities for the 
society but also new security challenges. Combination of increased dependence on 
ICT which is not flawless with human failure or intentional damage makes mitigation 
of damages more complicated. The emergence of new technologies brings new 
opportunities for the development of the society but also new vulnerabilities and new 
demands for the security of ICT and whole society. 

Increased dependence on ICT enhances vulnerability of the state and its 
citizens to the cybernetic attacks. These attacks may be motivated by crime, 
economic profit or terrorism and may be used to destabilise society. Leaks of 
strategic information, infringements into ICT of state institutions or strategic 
companies may endanger interests of the Czech Republic. Examples show rapid and 
diverse development in the field of cybernetic security. Attacks against ICT are more 
complex and sophisticated. These attacks are aimed against various targets and 
waged by various means. Also the nature of attackers and their motives are 
changing. Parts of the critical infrastructure, crucial for functioning of the state, are 
becoming target of attacks more and more often. 

Considering the fact that digital society is globalised and cybernetic attack are 
crossing state, cultural and legislative boundaries, it is often not obvious which 
jurisdiction should be applied to them. Close international cooperation is therefore 
needed also in the area of legislation. 


 

II. Basic principles of strategy of cybernetic security 

Investment into cybernetic security means investing into our future and our 
economic growth. The level of cybernetic security comprises from all measures, both 
national and international, adopted to protect availability of ICT and integrity, 
authenticity and confidentiality of data in the cyberspace. Cyber security has to be 
based on complex approach demanding information sharing and coordination of 
activities. The cooperation between military and civilian, public and private and 
international and national spheres is to be ensured while building the system of 
cybernetic security. Only such approach ensures sound operation of ICT 
infrastructure in critical areas, rapid and effective reaction to cybernetic attacks and 
legal protection in the digital world. The issue of cybernetic security cannot be seen 
as an isolated problem of the Czech Republic or several parts of our society. It’s not 
only international, inter-ministerial public or private sphere issue but the problem of 
whole society. Therefore, ensuring of cybernetic security deserves the highest 
priority. 

Interconnection and strengthening cooperation of all parts of society 

It is desirable to coordinate all initiatives of state (civilian, police, military), 
commercial and academic entities, those which have done a lot of good work in their 
areas of responsibility and those which weren’t very active so far. Only coordinated 
effort leads towards enhancing of cybernetic security without dispersion and useless 
doubling of efforts and growth of costs. ICT infrastructure, goods and services are 
from largest part provided by the private sector. Mutual trust and information sharing 
are thus basic precondition for successful cooperation between public and private 
sector. 

Individual responsibility 

It is the basic interest of the state to establish the ICT security rules in a way to 
be accepted by all users of cyberspace (state bodies, critical infrastructure entities, 
public entities, commercial companies and citizens) and service providers in order to 
adopt in their ICT systems appropriate measures to protect the system against 
internal and external attacks and not to pose a threat for other systems. 


Inter-ministerial cooperation 

According to the decision of the Government of the Czech Republic no. 781 
from 19th October 2011 the body responsible for the field of cybernetic security is the 
national Security Authority (hereinafter “NSA”). The Council for Cybernetic Security 
(hereinafter “Council”) plays a key role in the inter-ministerial coordination. It will, 
among other tasks, initiate cooperation of state bodies. In line with its statute, the 
Council will establish working groups comprised of relevant experts. The working 
groups will draft documents dealing with specific issues of cybernetic security for the 
Council. 

International Cooperation 

Bearing in mind that a measure could be effective only if implemented or 
coordinated on an international level the Czech Republic will actively support through 
common bodies and working groups the efforts of the European Union (hereinafter 
“EU”) and North Atlantic Treaty Organisation (hereinafter “NATO”) to create 
international policies, standards and norms and adequately implement those policies, 
standards and norms into national legislation dealing with cybernetic security. 

Adequacy of adopted measures 

There is no way how to achieve absolute cybernetic security. The Czech 
Republic will adopt measures based on realistic evaluation of risks and shall be 
appropriate to such risks. They will respect protection of privacy and basic rights as 
free access to information, freedom of speech and others. The measures shall be 
appropriate to the necessity to ensure security on one side and to respect basic 
rights and freedoms on the other side. 

 

III. Strategic goals and measures 

Strategy adopts measures against current threats and is a basis for the Action 
Plan which defines particular steps and identifies those responsible for their 
achievement. The following areas shall be prioritised: 

Creation of legislative framework 

The NSA shall draft a specialised law on cybernetic security which will 
determine responsibilities of the national Centre for Cybernetic Security (hereinafter 
“NCCS”). The law shall define obligations of entities offering and/or using services in 
the cyberspace. It shall further determine means and scope of cooperation with 
private sector, public and international institutions. 

 International laws, agreements, trends and recommendation in the field of 
cybernetic security e-commerce and electronic transactions shall be regularly 
evaluated and the conclusions and recommendations stemming from such 
evaluation shall be implemented. The Czech Republic shall actively participate in 


drafting of laws, norms and other cooperation associated with cybernetic security in 
the framework of EU, NATO and other international organisations. 

Establishing National Centre for Cybernetic Security and Governmental 
CERT 

The NCCS shall be established within NSA to optimize cooperation between 
state bodies and improve coordination of protection and implementation of counter-
measures. Governmental CERT (Computer Emergency Response Team) will be part 
of the NCCS. The NCCS shall actively cooperate with other state bodies, academic 
institutions and commercial entities on the basis of cooperation agreements. Quick 
and effective sharing of information about vulnerabilities of ICT, forms of cybernetic 
attacks profiles and motivation of the perpetrators will enable NCCS to analyse 
security incidents and draft recommendations of counter-measures. It is in the best 
interest of the private sphere to cooperate with NCCS in protection of their own ICT 
systems against attack through cybernetic attacks. Bearing in mind that the best way 
to ensure security is through proper preparation and prevention, the NCCS shall 
establish a system of early warning and shall provide recommendations how to 
protect against cybernetic attacks. 

NCCS shall push for the system of testing of handling security risks and 
proposed counter-measures as a part of risk management system. Such capabilities 
shall be subject to regular testing through cybernetic defence exercises (also on 
international level). 

 

Protection of critical information infrastructure 

Protection of critical information infrastructure is one of the main priorities in 
cybernetic security. This infrastructure poses main part of almost all parts of critical 
infrastructure and is becoming more and more important. Both private and public 
spheres have to create conditions for closer cooperation based on information 
sharing. It will be properly evaluated where the security measures will be fully 
implemented and where shall be additional powers in case of specific attacks and 
threats. 

 

Strengthening of cybernetic security of information and communication 
systems of public governance 

Users of ICT need to be provided with relevant and consistent information 
about risks and safe ways how to utilize the cyberspace. NCCS shall provide such 
information on GovCERT.cz portal. Also information about available security products 
and services will be provided on the portal. 

Implementation of security rules and standards in information systems whose 
secure operation is crucial for the functioning of the state is one of the preconditions 
for enhancing cybernetic security of those systems. Effective cybernetic security 


demands obligatory implementation and proper adherence to those rules and 
standards and regular inspections of their implementation in the public governance 
bodies. 

Methodical documents (regulations and recommended practices) shall be 
prepared. Enhancing of level of information security will be done through 
implementation of the ISMS (Information Security Management System). 

 

Effectiveness of fighting crime in the cyberspace 

NCCS shall contribute to fight against cybernetic criminality by cooperating 
with law enforcement bodies and shall use their experience during development of 
means and measures against cybernetic attacks. 

 

Coordination of activities to ensure cybernetic security in Europe 

Global cyberspace security may be achieved only through coordination on 
national and international level. 

The NSA shall support appropriate measures based on European Action Plan 
for Protection of Critical Information Infrastructure in the framework of the EU. 
Further, the cooperation with the European Network and Information Security Agency 
(ENISA) shall commence in the field of training and information sharing. The ideas for 
future activities may be found in „EU Internal Security Strategy“ and in „Digital 
Agenda for Europe“ as well as in the new „NATO Policy on Cyber Defence“. The 
cooperation in the areas under NSA responsibility shall be also established with the 
newly established European Agency for Management of Large-Scale IT Systems and 
with the EU Centre for Cybernetic Criminality. 

 

Using of reliable IT 

Availability of reliable ICT systems to public governance users has to be 
ensured. Research and development of means for protection of ICT systems of 
public governance and critical infrastructure facilities shall be supported. The aim will 
be to use technical and software means accredited according to international 
standards in areas critical for the security of the state. 


 

Raising awareness about cybernetic security 

Establishing cybernetic security cannot rely on technical means only. Proper 
care has to be given also to end-users and administrators of ICT systems, 
development workers, public contract awarders, auditors and managers. Insufficient 
information about security of ICT systems brings serious risks. Lack of trained and 
informed personnel and further education raise vulnerability and damages. 

Awareness of citizens about cybernetic security shall be risen through 
spreading of relevant information in cooperation with media. Cybernetic security shall 
part of training of public employees and will be supported in the private sphere as 
well. The aim is to reach sufficient level of knowledge for each position in the area of 
cybernetic security. 

Cooperation aimed at creating training programmes focusing on cybernetic 
security shall be started with the academic and private spheres. Needs for 
qualification in cybernetic security, opportunities of school and other education shall 
be evaluated on a regular basis. The issue of cybernetic security will be implemented 
into all levels of education. 

 

Response to cybernetic attacks 

Bearing in mind that the cybernetic attacks against the systems of public 
governance and critical infrastructure cannot be avoided the state has to prepared for 
such attacks. Complex set of measures to be implemented in the event of cybernetic 
attack has to be created in cooperation with all competent state bodies. Necessity 
and adequacy of such measures has to be taken in mind. 

Strategy in the Field of Cybernetic Security for 2012 – 2015 follows up to the 
Security Strategy of The Czech Republic and reflects the challenges of modern 
information society. The Strategy provides institutional framework contributing to the 
security system of the Czech Republic. This framework constitutes beginning of 
active policy of cybernetic protection of the state which is to be permanently 
evaluated and amended. Awareness of every individual, operator, administrator, 
university or company about security challenges of ICT is a basic precondition to 
ensure reliability and security of the cyberspace. The Czech Republic considers the 
issue of cybernetic security to be an important part of daily use of ICT and shall 
further work to ensure it.
