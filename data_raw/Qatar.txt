FOREWORD 

The Internet has connected us to people all over the globe in ways that were unimaginable a  
decade ago, reducing barriers to communication and promoting cooperation in every area of  
our personal and professional lives. Cyberspace has become a dynamic and integral part of  
our society, propelling economic growth and innovation and enriching our lives in countless  
ways—and it will continue to expand and afford us even more opportunity in the future. 

However, with these great rewards come new risks to the very infrastructure that underpins  
our ability to use the Internet safely and securely. Cyberspace, with its unlimited borders,  
provides those who would do harm with unparalleled opportunities to interfere with  
individuals and businesses. Luckily, we do not have to face this formidable task of cyber  
security alone. In this era of increasing—and increasingly malicious—cyber attacks of all sorts,  
keeping our networks and our people safe is one of the greatest global challenges facing  
all nations. 

To address those challenges, Qatar is ramping up its cyber security efforts as well as working  
with our counterparts across the globe to ensure an open and secure cyberspace. In 2013,  
the Prime Minister established the National Cyber Security Committee to address the cyber  
agenda at the national level and to ensure that all public and private entities are adopting  
the right cyber agenda. And, we have developed a National Cyber Security Strategy, which is  
outlined in the pages of this document. 

The objectives are very clear: safeguard the nation’s critical information infrastructure;  
respond to and recover from cyber attacks; establish a legal framework and regulations to  
establish a safe and secure cyberspace; foster a culture of cyber security that promotes safe  
and appropriate use of cyberspace; and enhance our national cyber security capabilities. 

While the government will lead the effort to safeguard government systems and networks,  
to succeed, cyber security must be a shared responsibility of government, businesses  
institutions, and individuals, and stakeholder coordination is essential. 

As new, complex and global cyber security challenges emerge, Qatar is well positioned  
to be vigilant in enhancing the country’s cyber readiness and resilience and protecting  
cyberspace for future generations. Inspired by the leaders of our nation, as envisioned in  
the Qatar National Vision 2030, we will continue to harness the power of information and  
communications technology to ensure a prosperous future for all of our people.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

The Internet has been an unprecedented engine for development, social progress, and inno- 
vation. However, it is also used by cyber criminals, hackers, hacktivists, and foreign intelligence  
services who want to harm us by compromising or damaging our digital infrastructure. The  
unlimited  borders  of  cyberspace  have  provided  them  with  an  unparalleled  opportunity  to  
interfere with individuals, businesses, government, and other institutions, and they use some  
of the most malicious and advanced techniques. One of the greatest global and strategic chal- 
lenges	of	our	time	is	how	to	sustain	a	safe	environment	while	continuing	to	expand	the	benefits	 
of a free and open cyberspace. 

Qatar’s rapidly developing economy is using information and communications technology (ICT)  
as a platform for innovation and prosperity. Resilience and security in cyberspace are vital to  
Qatar’s continued success and growth. Therefore, a comprehensive national strategy is required  
to address current and emerging threats and risks. 

In 2013, Qatar established the National Cyber Security Committee (Committee) to provide a  
governance structure for collaboratively addressing cyber security at the highest levels of its  
government. The Committee developed Qatar’s National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS), which  
represents a blueprint for moving forward to improve Qatar’s cyber security. The NCSS combines  
good governance with a set of cyber security initiatives, measures, and awareness programs that  
will	result	in	an	efficient	protective	strategy	in	the	long	term. 

The NCSS is based on a deep understanding of the threats and challenges Qatar is facing—from  
malicious actors to a shortage of workers with the necessary cyber security skills and a lack of  
reliable local providers of cyber security services—and is divided into several sections. Chapter  
2 describes the threats and Qatar’s existing capabilities in detail. Qatar’s current capabilities  
to respond to the threats—from policy instruments such as the National Information Assurance  
Policy, and the Banking Supervision Rules to the technical and operational expertise in Qatar’s  
Computer	Emergency	Response	Team	(Q-CERT),	a	trusted	authority	that	promotes	the	identifi- 
cation and prevention of cyber attacks for the government and critical sectors—provide a strong  
foundation for continuing to improve Qatar’s cyber security.  

Chapter 3 describes Qatar’s strategic approach to national cyber security. 

Qatar’s vision is to establish and maintain a secure cyberspace to safeguard national interests  
and preserve the fundamental rights and values of our society.  

The	vision	is	supported	by	five	objectives	that	determine	where	action	will	be	taken	to	deliver	 
benefit	and	improve	Qatar’s	cyber	security:	 

§§Objective 1: Safeguard the national critical information infrastructure;  

§§Objective 2: Respond to, resolve, and recover from cyber incidents and attacks through timely  
   information sharing, collaboration, and action; 

vi 

----------------------- Page 7-----------------------

§§Objective  3:  Establish  a  legal  and  regulatory  framework  to  enable  a  safe  and  vibrant  
    cyberspace; 

§§Objective 4:  Foster a culture of cyber security that promotes safe and appropriate use of  
    cyberspace; and  

§§Objective 5: Develop and cultivate national cyber security capabilities. 

Together, these objectives provide the foundation for protecting against, preparing for, detecting,  
responding to, and recovering from cyber incidents and attacks. Each objective is supported by  
initiatives that will drive action.  

Chapter 4 provides details on the Qatari Government’s Action Plan to achieve Qatar’s cyber  
security vision. The Action Plan is organized by objective. The delivery of these projects will take  
considerable time and coordination between all stakeholders.  

Successful implementation of the NCSS requires continuous commitment, governance, and  
action by various stakeholders who are connected by a shared vision and guiding principles.  
Qatar’s approach to cyber security is based on three guiding principles: 

§§The  government  will  lead  by  example  to  safeguard  government  systems  and  networks,  
    implementing cyber security requirements while building and adopting new technologies; 

§§Cyber security is a shared responsibility of all government entities, businesses, institutions,  
    and individuals; and 

§§Qatar will pursue cyber security policies and initiatives that preserve society’s fundamental  
    rights and values, consistent with laws and regulations. 

Strong governance is needed to implement and manage execution of the NCSS. To that end,  
Qatar	will	establish	the	Cyber	Security	Coordination	Office,	which	will	report	to	the	Prime	Minister	 
and	be	the	focal	point	for	cyber	security	activity	across	Qatar.	This	office	will	be	responsible	for:	 
(1) establishing priorities to promote the highest level of cyber security in Qatar, (2) providing  
strategic direction for Qatar’s cyber security efforts, and (3) working in close partnership with  
organizations	with	cyber	security	missions	and	mandates	to	fulfill	the	objectives	of	the	NCSS.	 

This is an integrated and holistic approach that will enhance synergies, avoid duplication, and  
maximize  resource  utilization  in  managing  the  dynamic  environment  and  emerging  threats  
in cyberspace. 

As new, complex, and global cyber security challenges emerge, Qatar’s dependence on ICT  
will continue to increase. Qatar must be vigilant and enhance the country’s cyber readiness and  
resilience, and the NCSS demonstrates Qatar’s commitment to protecting a safe and secure  
cyberspace for future generations.  

                                                                                                               vii

 1.  INTRODUCTION 

Qatar  is  rapidly  developing  its  economy,  in  part  by  embracing  information  and  communi- 
cations technology (ICT) as a platform for innovation and prosperity. The adoption of ICT is  
expanding Qatar’s cyberspace, which has become integral to society, government, and busi- 
nesses. Resilience and security in cyberspace are vital to Qatar’s continued success and growth;  
therefore, a comprehensive national strategy is required to address current and emerging risks  
and threats.1 

While ICT facilitates a well-connected society, it also increases the risk of undermining our social  
norms. The interconnected nature of cyberspace also increases the threat from a variety of  
malicious actors. These threats come from hackers, hacktivists, organized criminals, and even  
foreign  governments.  Qatar  currently  relies  on  a  small  set  of  penal  statutes  to  investigate,  
prosecute, and punish cyber crime; however, additional measures are needed to ensure more  
comprehensive protection against cyber incidents and attacks. 

To address current and emerging risks, Qatar’s National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS): 

§§Makes a commitment to protect Qatar’s interests in cyberspace; 

§§Institutionalizes a cyber security vision and objectives for the future; 

§§Is grounded in the key principles of leadership, shared responsibility, and ethical values; and 

§§Is informed by mandates, other national strategies and international best practices, as well  
   as the rights and values of individuals. 

                                                                                                         1

QATAR NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 

The cyber threat landscape has evolved from one of individual hackers to highly organized  
groups and advanced cyber criminal syndicates. Cyber attacks are more targeted and sophis- 
ticated	than	ever	before.	Powerful	new	malware	is	capable	of	stealing	confidential	data	and	 
disabling network infrastructure. Attacks on critical infrastructure, including industrial control  
systems (ICS), can disable physical machinery, cause catastrophic equipment failure, and even  
result in loss of life. Qatar, like many other nations, must be prepared to address the following  
types of threats: 

§§Hacktivists. These are individuals or groups who seek  
    to disrupt systems and networks for a variety of motives,                    CYBER THREATS

    transactions or to siphon money. Information theft is also common, as cyber criminals will  
    sell sensitive corporate information to unauthorized individuals or groups. Cyber criminals  
    leverage various methods to achieve their objectives, such as distributing massive amounts  
    of	e-mails	while	posing	as	banks	or	other	authorities	to	obtain	customer	identification	and	 
    financial	information.	They	may	also	use	large-scale	DDoS	attacks	to	overwhelm	Internet-

    fee)	fraud	scams	to	target	unsuspecting	individuals	for	financial	gain	prior	to	the	2022	FIFA	 
    World Cup in Qatar.10 

§§Malicious Insiders. These are trusted individuals who are motivated to compromise the  
    confidentiality,	integrity,	or	availability	of	an	organization’s	information	and	information	 
    systems.	Their	motives	may	include	financial	gain,	revenge,	or	ideology.	Insiders	do	not	need	 
    to	infiltrate	perimeter	network	defenses	because	they	have	trusted	access	to	information	and	 
    information systems and can use various methods to damage or destroy government and  
                         11 
    business systems. 

Cyber attacks are on the rise in Qatar and around the world; therefore, continued vigilance and  
attention is required. Qatar is committed to ensuring the security of information assets and  
systems essential to government, businesses, institutions, and individuals.

2.2 Challenges 

The adoption of new technologies such as cloud computing and mobile applications, the imple- 
mentation of smart-grid technology, and the substantial increase in technology users present  
key opportunities for development and innovation. These opportunities, however, exist in an  
increasingly fast-paced and evolving environment that will continue to impact Qatar’s ability to  
innovate and compete in the global economy. The challenges in this environment include: 

§§Cyber  Security  Skills  and  Services  Deficits.  Globally,  and  in  Qatar,  there  is  a  shortage  
   of  workers  with  the  requisite  knowledge,  skills,  and  abilities  to  effectively  understand  
   the complexity of ICT and address cyber security issues. In addition, few local providers  
   offer robust and reliable cyber security services. As ICT products and services increase in  
   complexity,	these	deficits	have	the	potential	to	grow,	and	if	not	adequately	addressed,	further	 
   impact the country’s ability to protect critical information infrastructure (CII). 

§§Global Supply Chain Risks. The global cyber ecosystem is a system of interconnected  
   systems that often include multiple components from various sources around the world. It is  
   increasingly	difficult	to	determine	the	origin	and	integrity	of	the	components	of	ICT	products.	 
   A global supply chain introduces weaknesses that malicious actors may exploit to launch  
   attacks. 

§§ICS Connectivity. ICSs are increasingly connected to business networks and the Internet.  
   While	this	connectivity	provides	efficiencies	that	enable	the	remote	monitoring	of	the	 
   mechanical processes used for oil and natural gas production, electricity generation, and  
   water	purification,	it	also	increases	the	vulnerability	of	ICSs	to	cyber	threats. 

§§Information Sharing Constraints.  Information owners or providers may be reluctant to  
   share information about vulnerabilities, incidents, and best practices for fear of revealing  
   weaknesses. In addition, individual organizations do not always understand that information  
   they possess about cyber threats, vulnerabilities, and effective best practices can be of value  
   to others. 

§§Executive  Leadership  Awareness.  While  information  technology  (IT)  managers,  chief  
   information	officers,	chief	technology	officers,	and	chief	information	security	officers	typically	 
   address cyber security for their organizations, cyber security affects more than the smooth  
   operation of an organization—it affects an organization’s overall mission and its bottom line.  
   Unfortunately, when communication between executive leadership and IT professionals is  
   limited, the senior-most levels of the organization can lack awareness of the real risks or the  
   resources necessary to implement security requirements, coordinate incident response, and  
   mitigate those risks. 

§§Changing Privacy Expectations.  Due to the increased use of personal information within  
   government organizations and throughout international business, countries continue to enact  
   and update privacy laws to protect individuals and their data. Many of these countries require  
   “adequate levels of protection” before allowing international organizations to transfer data  
   to destinations outside their borders.12 When personal information is not properly protected,  

   organizations face potential risks: for a government organization, this could mean loss of trust  
   in its online services; businesses risk losing customers to global competitors. 

                                                                                                       5

QATAR NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 

2.3 Existing Capabilities to Meet the Threats and Challenges 

Qatar recognizes the importance of cyber security and has worked diligently over the last several  
years to develop and implement cyber security protection measures across the country. These  
measures have made it possible for government, businesses, institutions, and individuals to  
respond to the threats and challenges in cyberspace, thereby providing a strong foundation for  
achieving cyber security objectives. Among these efforts: 

§§Qatar has developed strategies and implemented policies to safeguard CII that is important  
   to national security and economic prosperity, such as that used for power generation, oil and  
   gas	production,	financial	transactions,	healthcare,	and	government	operations.	The	National  
   Information Assurance Policy and the  National ICS Security Standard provide important  
   guidance on security controls and practices to protect CII and improve Internet security.  
   In addition, as part of the National Information Assurance Framework, Qatar published  
   Anti-Spam Guidelines in 2013 to reduce the impact of unsolicited electronic messages (or  
   spam) on entities and individuals. 

§§To	improve	the	security	of	financial	transactions,	the	Qatar	Central	Bank	(QCB)	issued	Banking  
   Supervision Rules, which	identifies	the	cyber	security	controls	that	banks	must	follow,	such	as	 
   reporting	cyber	incidents	and	attacks	to	QCB	and	the	Qatar	Computer	Emergency	Response	 
   Team (Q-CERT). 

§§Qatar	has	established	Information	Risk	Expert	Committees	(IREC)	in	the	finance,	energy,	and	 
   government sectors. These public-private partnerships deal with a variety of cyber security  
   issues, including threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences; preparedness activities; and  
   mitigation strategies. The IRECs facilitate the exchange of information within each sector  
   and with other stakeholders to enhance CII resilience. 

§§Qatar has made progress in developing a domestic legal framework that provides national  
   governance for cyber security, combats cyber crime, protects individuals’ privacy, and  
   promotes CII resilience. The enactment of Decree Law No. 16 of 2010 on the Promulgation  
   of the Electronic Commerce and Transactions Law established penalties for crimes, including  
   unlawful  access  to  information  systems,  identity  theft,  and  intercepting  information  or  
   illegally interfering with an information system. In 2013, Qatar established the National Cyber  
   Security Committee (Committee) to provide an overarching governance structure to oversee  
   collaborative efforts to address cyber security. 

§§Qatar’s  investment  in  developing  technical  and  operational  expertise  includes  the  
   establishment of Q-CERT, a trusted authority that promotes a strengthened cyber environment  
   for the Qatari government and all critical sectors. Q-CERT seeks to proactively prevent and  
   detect	cyber	threats	before	they	cause	significant	harm.

                                       QATAR NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 

§§In	December	2013,	Qatar	held	its	first	national-level	cyber	exercise	for	critical	sectors,	including	 
   banking	and	finance,	energy	facilities	and	networks,	government,	and	transportation,	to	 
   enhance these organizations’ capabilities to identify and mitigate cyber threats. 

§§Qatar continues to empower Internet users with the Cyber Safety Education and Awareness  
   programs that provide information on cyber threats and cyber security prevention and  
   detection tools. 

§§Qatar has established capabilities in digital forensics, enhancing its ability to investigate cyber  
   crime. Qatar’s Cyber Crimes Investigation Center and Information Security Center support  
   efforts to safeguard the general public and crack down on criminals who use sophisticated  
   technologies to carry out criminal activities. 

§§Qatar has formed strong international alliances and is an active participant in global efforts  
   to  shape  international  standards  and  norms  on  cyber  security,  including  efforts  in  the  
   International Telecommunication Union (ITU), the Forum for Incident Response and Security  
   Teams (FIRST), and Meridian Process.13 

The Qatari government is proactively investing in people, developing policies and processes,  
and implementing technology to improve cyber security for government entities, businesses,  
institutions, and individuals. Additional efforts, however, are needed to meet the demands of  
the future as new threats emerge and ICT reliance grows. Efforts to date have largely been  
distributed and from the bottom up. As a result, cyber security is neither institutionalized at the  
national level nor implemented across government entities, businesses, and other institutions.  
The Qatari government’s ability to enforce laws and promote the adoption of cyber security best  
practices	has	been	limited,	making	it	difficult	to	combat	cyber	crime	and	help	entities	deter	and	 
defend against cyber attacks. 

While businesses are beginning to appreciate the risks in cyberspace and take actions to improve  
cyber security, many follow independent policies and cannot obtain the necessary skills and  
technologies to institute effective cyber security best practices. Although individuals can access  
information about cyber threats as well as simple yet effective mitigation techniques, users  
require additional assistance to help maintain the health of their systems and protect their  
personal information. The efforts discussed above provide a strong foundation for the future;  
however, government entities, businesses, institutions, and individuals must work together to  
enhance Qatar’s cyber security. 

                                                                                                      7

3.  QATAR’S NEW APPROACH TO  
       CYBER SECURITY 

Qatar’s  new  approach  to  cyber  security  balances  the  need  to  protect  interconnected  ICT  
products	and	services	with	the	need	to	provide	opportunities	that	maximize	the	benefits	and	 
efficiencies	found	in	ICT	advances.	The	Qatari	government	will	act	to	defend	Qatar’s	interests	in	 
cyberspace	from	large-scale	attacks	and	incidents	that	could	harm	national	security.	Specifically,	 
the government is prepared to engage in diplomacy; participate in the formation of international  
rules; and bring military, intelligence, and security expertise to bear on cyber operations to  
protect the nation. 

The NCSS represents an actionable path forward to achieve Qatar’s cyber security vision for  
the future. It is a call to government, businesses, institutions, and individuals to create a more  
secure	cyber	environment.	This	section	describes	Qatar’s	cyber	security	vision	and	identifies	 
the objectives and initiatives necessary to achieve that vision.  

3.1 Vision  

      Establish and maintain a secure cyberspace to safeguard national interests  
           and preserve the fundamental rights and values of Qatar’s society. 

3.2 Objectives 

To	achieve	this	vision,	Qatar	seeks	to	fulfill	the	following	objectives:	 

  Objective 1:         Objective 2:        Objective 3:        Objective 4:        Objective 5:  

  Safeguard            Respond             Establish a         Foster a            Develop  
   national CII.       to, resolve,        legal and           culture of          and cultivate  
                       and recover         regulatory          cyber security      national  
                       from cyber          framework to        that promotes       cyber security  
                       incidents           enable a safe       safe and            capabilities. 
                       and attacks         and vibrant         appropriate  
                       through timely      cyberspace.         use of  
                       information                             cyberspace. 
                       sharing,  
                       collaboration,  
                       and action. 

Collectively, these objectives provide the foundation for protecting against and preparing for  
cyber threats (i.e., a proactive approach to cyber security) as well as detecting, responding to,  
and recovering from threats and challenges (i.e., reactive cyber security efforts). 

                                                                                                    9

QATAR NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 

3.3 Strategic Initiatives  

The strategic initiatives below describe how Qatar will make progress against the cyber security  
objectives. While the initiatives are organized by objective, initiatives for one objective may  
enable progress and success for other objectives. 

                                 Objective 1: Safeguard national CII. 

   To make progress against the objective, Qatar will: 

    §§Assess the risk to CII; 

                                                                                          14 
    §§Implement cyber security controls and standards to mitigate risk to CII; 

    §§Analyze  cyber  security  trends  and  threats  to  CII  and  provide  timely  reports  to  
       stakeholders; 

    §§Foster the use of trustworthy technology products and services; and 

    §§Continuously monitor the security posture of CII. 

Proactive cyber risk management is necessary to ensure that Qatar continues to identify and  
protect systems that support the delivery of essential services and capabilities. To prevent future  
cyber incidents and attacks, the government, critical sector organizations (CSO), and other orga- 
nizations must adopt security controls and prioritize actions to mitigate risk to those assets,  
systems, and networks essential to Qatar’s well-being, prosperity, and security. 

In addition, Qatar is building the capability to collect and analyze cyber security incident, alert,  
and threat information from the Government Network, a network for government entities to  
connect over a secure communications platform, thereby allowing for improved information  
sharing and enhanced security for e-services. Through advanced data analytics, Qatar plans to  
correlate this information to identify trends related to security requirement compliance and cyber  
threat activity on the network.15 This continuous monitoring of critical networks will enable Qatar  

to understand in close to real time the risk to networks, detect incidents, and take immediate  
actions to mitigate consequences. 

    Objective 2: Respond to, resolve, and recover from cyber incidents and attacks  
               through timely information sharing, collaboration, and action. 

   To make progress against the objective, Qatar will: 

                                                                          16 
    §§Enhance and maintain situational awareness capabilities;    

    §§Establish and continuously enhance incident response capabilities; 

    §§Reduce cyber infections within CII; 

    §§Establish mechanisms and procedures to facilitate timely information sharing and action  
       among stakeholders; and 

    §§Ensure preparedness by conducting cyber security exercises and drills.

                                       QATAR NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 

Situational awareness is necessary to effectively detect, respond to, and recover from cyber  
incidents and attacks. Sector regulators and CSOs should have the capability to monitor network  
activity and maintain situational awareness. Information sharing among the critical sectors will  
further increase visibility into the current state of threats as well as provide an early warning  
system for preventing, detecting, and responding to cyber incidents and attacks. Qatar will  
establish	the	Cyber	Security	Coordination	Office,	which	will	report	to	the	Prime	Minister.	The	 
Office	will	be	a	focal	point	for	coordinating	core	cyber	security	functions,	including	national	cyber	 
incident management. Collaboration and partnership among multiple stakeholders to share  
information and gain greater situational awareness of threats, incidents, and attacks will enhance  
Qatar’s ability to anticipate, respond to, and recover from incidents and attacks with minimum  
impact	to	government,	businesses,	and	society.	Furthermore,	national	and	sector-specific	cyber	 
exercises will be held regularly to improve information sharing, collaboration, and coordination  
among stakeholders; identify risks; and drive improvements. 

                  Objective 3: Establish a legal and regulatory framework   
                           to enable a safe and vibrant cyberspace. 

   To make progress against the objective, Qatar will: 

   §§Increase capabilities to combat cyber crime; 

   §§Develop and implement laws, regulations, and national policies to address cyber security  
       and cyber crime;17 

   §§Monitor and enforce compliance with cyber security and cyber crime laws, regulations,  
       and national policies; and 

   §§Build	and	maintain	strong	international	relationships	to	establish	cyber	security	norms	 
       and standards. 

Qatar  seeks  a  dynamic  legal  framework  that  can  keep  pace  with  an  evolving  cyber  threat  
landscape and new technologies as government entities, businesses, and society continue to  
mature. The development, enactment, and enforcement of a comprehensive set of laws related  
to cyber security and cyber crime will empower organizations by clarifying roles and responsi- 
bilities. Qatar will collaboratively consider the perspectives and input of relevant government  
entities and institutions to develop these laws, regulations, and national policies. 

The Qatari government is committed to protecting its citizens and residents from cyber criminals.  
Qatar aims to combat cyber crime by neutralizing and reducing threats via enhanced law enforce- 
ment techniques and technologies related to gathering forensic evidence and investigating  
malicious activity.  

The interconnected and distributed nature of cyberspace allows malicious actors to easily cross  
geographic boundaries. Combating cyber crime and other threats requires international col- 
laboration. The Qatari government will coordinate with the international community to enhance  
capabilities in Qatar and to combat cyber crime internationally. Furthermore, Qatar will establish  
entities and acquire the capabilities necessary to increase its ability to prevent and combat  
cyber crime. Participation in international efforts to develop global cyber security standards  
and norms, identify and promote best practices, modernize and increase privacy protections,  
and maintain stable and effective Internet governance will further position Qatar to meet its  
obligations in cyberspace. 

                                                                                                     11

QATAR NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 

                      Objective 4: Foster a culture of cyber security that   
                     promotes safe and appropriate use of cyberspace. 

   To make progress against the objective, Qatar will: 

   §§Enhance cyber security awareness across society using multiple channels; 

   §§Encourage individuals to use cyber safety tools and solutions to protect against cyber  
      threats; and 

   §§Promote the development and delivery of cyber security education in schools, colleges,  
       and universities. 

Maintaining	a	safe	and	secure	online	environment	is	essential	to	fostering	digital	confidence.	To	 
encourage	a	profitable	online	economy,	consumers	must	trust	that	their	transactions	are	secure	 
and their personal information is safe. Raising awareness and encouraging information sharing  
among government, businesses, institutions, and individuals are two of the most effective ways  
to improve cyber security. In addition, the appropriate collection, use, and protection of personal  
information will help consumers safeguard themselves from identity theft. 

Qatar has begun building a cyber security culture through cyber safety campaigns, such as Safer  
Internet Day 2013, and targeted warnings about scams and other online threats via print and  
social media. Stakeholders from government, law enforcement, businesses, and academic institu- 
tions will work together to develop and implement cyber safety solutions and increase awareness  
of	cyber	security	and	associated	legal	requirements.	Fulfilling	this	objective	will	require	significant	 
collaboration among government entities, businesses, and institutions to educate all audiences  
on the importance of cyber security and cyber safety. 

         Objective 5: Develop and cultivate national cyber security capabilities. 

   To make progress against the objective, Qatar will: 

   §§Develop and maintain a professional cyber security workforce; 

   §§Foster business opportunities and strengthen the competitiveness of the cyber security  
       industry in the public and private sectors; and 

   §§Invest in research to develop and commercialize innovative cyber security technologies  
       and solutions. 

Qatar must be at the forefront of educational initiatives that will build and maintain a cyber  
workforce. This workforce must be capable of defending and protecting against cyber incidents  
and attacks. Qatar needs employees in government and industry who can recognize new devel- 
opments in cyberspace and understand how those developments may impact operations. 

At the same time, Qatar must also continue to drive the local innovation necessary to identify and  
implement new solutions that will address the complex cyber security challenges of the future.  
Local	cyber	security	businesses	must	be	able	to	flourish	and	provide	robust	and	reliable	cyber	 
security products and services that meet government and critical sector needs and requirements. 

Development of a national cyber security research and development agenda that is focused on  
building solutions to prevent, predict, and overcome cyber attacks will further prepare Qatar  
for emerging cyber threats. Existing data analytics and social computing capabilities will enable  
Qatar to pursue an agenda that supports the application of real-time data analytics to detect  
cyber attacks, conduct forensics and remediate cyber events, and anticipate and ultimately  
defeat cyber attacks.

4.  ACTION PLAN FOR 2014–2018 

The Action Plan provides more detail on the Qatari government’s plan to achieve Qatar’s cyber  
security vision. The Action Plan is organized by objective. Various stakeholders from govern- 
ment entities and institutions, including the Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Information and  
Communications Technology, the Ministry of Interior, Public Prosecution, Qatar Foundation,  
sector regulators and CSOs, the Supreme Education Council, and other organizations, must work  
collaboratively	with	many	others	to	implement	these	actions	for	the	benefit	of Qatar. 

                                Objective 1: Safeguard national CII. 

 Initiative                      Action 

 Assess the risk to CII          §§Develop a national CII risk management framework to guide  
                                   the	identification	of	CII	assets	and	organizations;	assessment	of	 
                                   threats, vulnerabilities, and consequences; and development of  
                                   risk	profiles

                                       QATAR NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 

5.  IMPLEMENTATION APPROACH 

Successful implementation of the NCSS requires continuous commitment, governance, and  
action by various stakeholders who are collectively responsible for the national approach to  
cyber security. These stakeholders are connected by a shared set of guiding principles that  
support Qatar’s cyber security vision. 

5.1  Guiding Principles 

Qatar’s approach to cyber security is based on the following three principles: 

The Government Will Lead the Way. Governments have an important responsibility to safeguard  
government	information,	systems,	and	networks	and	ensure	their	confidentiality,	integrity,	and	 
availability. The Qatari government will therefore lead by example, implementing cyber security  
requirements while building and adopting innovative and new technologies that provide the  
foundation for the economy. 

Cyber Security Is a Shared Responsibility.  Cyber security should be the responsibility of all  
government entities, businesses, institutions, and individuals. 

§§The Qatari government is responsible for protecting its information, systems, and networks;  
   investing in the people, processes, and technologies necessary to safeguard the services  
   that society relies on; and setting the direction for Qatar’s continued economic development  
   and growth. 

§§Businesses	are	responsible	for	protecting	their	information,	systems,	and	networks	from	cyber	 
   threats; sharing information; and responding should cyber incidents and attacks occur. 

§§Individuals  are  responsible  for  being  
   aware of threats; adopting best practices;             VALUES IN CYBER SECURITY 

   understanding  who  is  collecting  their  
   personal  information;  and  securing  their          §§Protect  government,  businesses,  institu- 
                                                           tions, and individuals from unacceptable  
   own information, systems, and networks.                 online	content	and behaviors; 

Fundamental   Rights   and   Values   will   be          §§Show tolerance and respect; 

Preserved.     In  cyberspace,     security   and        §§Embrace	innovation	and	the	free	flow	of	 
privacy are tightly intertwined. Strong security           ideas and information; 
measures and sound best practices are encour-            §§Support   collective   and   collaborative  
aged to protect personal or private information            efforts to address complex cyber security  
from unauthorized access or misuse. Qatar will             challenges; and  
pursue cyber security policies and initiatives           §§Promote  an  environment  that  rewards  
that preserve society’s values and expectations,           investment in security and technology. 
consistent with laws and regulations. 

5.2 Governance 

Strong governance is needed to implement and manage execution of the NCSS. To that end,  
Qatar	will	establish	the	Cyber	Security	Coordination	Office	(CSCO),	which	will	report	to	the	 
Prime Minister and be the focal point for cyber security activity across Qatar. The CSCO will  
be responsible for: (1) establishing priorities to promote the highest level of cyber security in  
Qatar, (2) providing strategic direction for Qatar’s cyber security efforts, and (3) working in close  
partnership	with	organizations	with	cyber	security	missions	and	mandates	to	fulfill	the	objectives	 
of the NCSS.  

                                                                                                    17 

----------------------- Page 26-----------------------

QATAR NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 

It is essential that stakeholders commit to successfully implementing the NCSS. Stakeholders will  
be	responsible	for	defining	their	own	detailed	implementation	plans	for	the	actions	they	need	 
to	fulfill.	Government	entities,	CSOs,	and	other	institutions	will	need	to	keep	track	of	milestones	 
and progress and be prepared to provide regular updates to the CSCO. In addition, stakehold- 
ers should commit to active and ongoing coordination across all levels of society to improve  
cyber security. 

5.3 Performance Measurement 

Stakeholder coordination, integrated decision making, and tracking progress will be required  
to accomplish the strategic initiatives and actions outlined in the NCSS and supporting docu- 
mentation.	The	CSCO	will	define	mechanisms	to	assess	progress,	work	with	the	Committee	and	 
stakeholders to make decisions regarding prioritization or Action Plan amendments, and monitor  
efforts to advance the objectives using a variety of metrics. In addition, the CSCO will report  
annually on progress against the objectives, thereby providing ongoing visibility into efforts to  
secure Qatar’s cyberspace.

                                         QATAR NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY 

6.  MOVING FORWARD  

Qatar will revise the NCSS every four years, or as necessary, to make coordinated adjustments  
and	refinements	to	account	for	national	and	international	legal,	operational,	and	technolog- 
ical developments. This review will seek to align Qatar’s cyber security vision with any new  
national-level strategy documentation (e.g., development strategies) and obtain input from  
stakeholders, as appropriate. 

As new, complex, and global cyber security challenges emerge and Qatar’s dependence on  
ICT increases, Qatar must be vigilant and continuously work in partnership to enhance its cyber  
security readiness and resilience in accordance with the NCSS. More than any other national-level  
document, the NCSS demonstrates Qatar’s commitment to protecting Qatar’s cyberspace for  
future generations.

Cyber Crime.  
    Misconduct or crime committed using technology. Examples of cyber crime may include  
    illegal access to systems or information, fraud, identity theft, or content-related offenses  
    such as spam. 

Cyber Security.  
    The collection of tools, policies, security concepts, security safeguards, guidelines, risk man- 
    agement approaches, actions, training, best practices, assurance, and technologies that can  
    be used to protect the cyber environment and organization and user’s assets. Organization  
    and user’s assets include connected computing devices, personnel, infrastructure, applica- 
    tions, services, telecommunications systems, and the totality of transmitted and/or stored  
    information  in  the  cyber  environment.  Cyber  security  strives  to  ensure  the  attainment  
    and maintenance of the security properties of the organization and user’s assets against  
    relevant security risks in the cyber environment. The general security objectives comprise  
    the	following:	confidentiality,	integrity	(which	may	include	authenticity	and	non-repudiation),	 
    and availability.21 

Cyber Security Controls.  
    Safeguards	or	counter	measures	to	ensure	the	confidentiality,	integrity,	and	availability	of	 
    information assets, systems, or networks and mitigate the risk to those assets, systems,  
    and networks. 

Cyberspace.  
    A virtual or electronic environment that results from the interdependent network of infor- 
    mation and communications technology (e.g., the Internet, telecommunications networks,  
    computer systems, and embedded processors and controllers) that links people with services  
    and information. 

Ecosystem.  
    A variety of interconnected and interdependent organizations, systems, and devices that  
    interact for multiple purposes using different processes. 

Exercise.  
    An	interactive	engagement	(half-day	to	five	days	or	more)	that	enables	participants	to	react	 
    to a plausible scenario in a risk-free environment. Exercises provide an effective tool for  
    testing  incident  response  plans;  validating  policies,  plans,  and  procedures;  identifying  
    vulnerabilities and reporting requirements; assessing risk and preparedness; discovering  
    interdependencies and response gaps; creating a shared perspective and buy-in among  
    diverse stakeholders; and building a common understanding of roles and responsibilities.  
    An exercise may also be referred to as a simulation, seminar, tabletop, drill, or wargame. 

                                                                                                      23
