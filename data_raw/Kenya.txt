Executive Summary
Global information and communication technology (ICT) growth has transformed how individuals, businesses,
and governments produce and receive information. Adoption of ICT into everyday life is widespread in Kenya.
The Government of Kenya is proud of this development and is actively encouraging its continued growth through
national initiatives such as Kenya’s Vision 2030, ICT Master Plan, and the recent deployment of nationwide fiberoptic network infrastructure. Such efforts provide a dramatic increase in interconnectivity among businesses
and individuals throughout Kenya. Kenyan public and private sector organizations are now using this increased
bandwidth and ICT capabilities to efficiently deliver services, conduct business transactions, and share
information across organizational, social, and geographic boundaries.
As Kenya matures into an information society the nation faces an increasingly evolving cyber threat landscape.
Nation states, criminal organizations, and hacktivists from all over the world are—and will continue—to
exploit ICT vulnerabilities in Kenya. This is simply a reality that every nation with robust ICT infrastructure
faces. While these actors seek to illicitly access, alter, disrupt, or destroy sensitive personal, business, and
government information, we are working diligently to evolve our means of protecting information in order to
counter today’s threats as well as those coming from over the horizon.
In response to these threats, and in direct support of the national priorities and ICT goals defined in
Vision 2030, Kenya’s ICT Ministry developed a National Cybersecurity Strategy (Strategy). The Strategy
defines Kenya’s cybersecurity vision, key objectives, and ongoing commitment to support national priorities
by encouraging ICT growth and aggressively protecting critical information infrastructures.
The Government of Kenya is committed to the safety, security, and prosperity of our nation and its partners.
We see cybersecurity as a key component in that commitment, providing organizations and individuals
with increased confidence in online and mobile transactions, encouraging greater foreign investment, and
opening a broader set of trade opportunities within the global marketplace. Successful implementation of
the strategy will further enable Kenya to achieve its economic and societal goals through a secure online
environment for citizens, industry, and foreign partners to conduct business.
Cybersecurity is a shared responsibility. The Government of Kenya will continue to partner with government,
private sector, academia, and other non-government entities to implement our Strategy in the most efficient
and effective way possible. We have every confidence that we will meet these challenges together and
increase recognition of Kenya as a trusted partner and cybersecurity leader in the East African Community
(EAC), Africa, and the world.

INTRODUCTION
The Importance of Cyberspace
Cyberspace is more than just the Internet and information and communications technology (ICT). It is a
domain similar to the domains of land, air, sea, and space, but with its own distinct characteristics and
challenges. The cyber domain is characterized by the digital storage, modification, and exchange of data via
networked systems and supported by critical information infrastructures. It has national and international
dimensions that include industry, commerce, intellectual property, security, technology, culture, policy, and
diplomacy. As such, cyberspace plays a critical role in the global economy.
Similar to other nations with a robust ICT infrastructure, Kenya’s conducts its social, economic and national
security activities in this digital, interconnected environment. For example, the Government of Kenya relies on
common infrastructure, information technology (IT) platforms, and new technologies to increase the efficiency
and effectiveness of government services. One of the main priorities of the Government of Kenya towards the
realization of national development goals and objectives for wealth and employment creation, as stipulated
in the Kenya Vision 2030, is to achieve an e-Government capability. At the same time, the development,
implementation, and adoption of technologies such as mobile computing, mobile banking, and broadband
communications enables Kenyans to connect with a speed and ease—unthinkable only five years ago.
However, these same technologies can present new risks that can cause widespread damage to national
security, economic growth, and critical infrastructures. Moreover, the reach and impact of cyberspace
is accelerating across the national and international boundaries, making it a complex challenge for any
government to address alone. For this reason, the Government of Kenya considers securing its national
cyberspace a national priority to continue to facilitate economic growth for the country and its citizens.

Implementation Hierarchy
ICT growth is particularly prevalent in Africa, where
technological advancement and innovation are driving
progress in key sectors (e.g., agriculture, education,
financial services, government, and health). In 2009,
the regional fiber-optic underwater cable increased
ICT mobilization and interconnectedness across
Kenya and much of East Africa.
With the rapid growth of technology, the Kenyan
people have quickly become accustomed to and
dependent on the services provided to them through
government and business websites, banking
connectivity with central banks and other individuals,
and ease of communications. These advances
continue to bring new and exciting opportunities to
businesses and individuals across Kenya.

February 2014

According to statistics released by The
Communications Authority of Kenya (CAK),
Kenya had an estimated 16.4 million
Internet users and 30.7 million mobile
network subscribers as of the second
quarter of fiscal year 2012/2013

THE CYBERSECURITY CHALLENGE
The Evolving Threat Landscape
Aggressively supporting the technological advancements in Kenya has resulted in a more open, interconnected
nation which can offer adversaries avenues for exploiting computer networks. Cyber attacks are continuously
evolving—to a great extent faster than cyber defences—resulting in an ever-increasing frequency of attacks
and the probability of success over time. Figure 1 provides a snapshot of the sophistication of cyber-attacks
from 1980-2012. These cyber attacks may come from hacktivists seeking to publicize political views, from
criminal organizations seeking financial gain, from terrorist groups seeking to inflict economic or political
damage, or from state-sponsored intelligence and security organizations advancing their own economic or
national security aims. Many attacks involve extremely sophisticated technological and social engineering
techniques; however, low-technology penetrations—such as insider threats—remain a danger.

Cybersecurity—a National Priority
The expansive and dynamic nature of ICT creates a
wide and deep range of challenges. The Government
of Kenya is addressing these challenges to provide
for cybersecurity at the national level, enabling
economic growth and protecting the interests of the
Kenyan people. In evaluating the potential paths
forward, the Government of Kenya identified several
key challenges resulting directly from emerging
risk areas inside Kenya, the East Africa Community
(EAC), and internationally. By addressing these
risks and understanding the impact of Kenya’s
cybersecurity efforts, technology growth and
economic development will be significantly enabled
by cybersecurity implementation.

Both financial and non-financial institutions
need high awareness of the need for secure
online systems. This will ensure a secure
online environment for conducting business
and other economic activities. Encourage the
use of security standards while designing,
building and deploying IT systems.
(source: http://www.ict.go.ke/docs/MasterPlan2017.pdf)

Risks and challenges can manifest from various
sources—even from those areas where technology
is enabling significant growth and prosperity. For example—by providing people with the ability to access
and exchange information, they become dependent on that information to socialized with family and friends,
conduct business, and feel connected in our modern world. The National Cyber Security Master Plan addresses
emerging cyber risks and the challenges that the ICT may face in the future.
Recognizing this and understanding the critical role ICT plays in Kenya’s economy, the Government of Kenya
developed the National Cybersecurity Strategy (Strategy). The Strategy supports the three pillars of the
Vision 2030 and supports other national initiatives such as the National ICT Master Plan1 (see Figure 2). The
purpose of the Strategy is to clearly define Kenya’s cybersecurity vision, goals, and objectives to secure the
nation’s cyberspace, while continuing to promote the use of ICT to enable Kenya’s economic growth.

Figure 2:  Cybersecurity Strategy Benefits

1.	 Enhance the nation’s cybersecurity posture in a manner that facilitates the country’s growth, safety, and prosperity.
2.	 Build national capability by raising cybersecurity awareness and developing Kenya’s workforce to address
cybersecurity needs.
3.	 Foster information sharing and collaboration among relevant stakeholders to facilitate an information sharing
environment focused on achieving the Strategy’s goals and objectives.
4.	 Provide national leadership by defining the national cybersecurity vision, goals, and objectives and coordinating
cybersecurity initiatives at the national level.
The subsequent sections outline specific objectives for each goal.

Goal 1: Enhance the Nation’s Cybersecurity Posture
Objective: Protect Critical Information Infrastructure
The Government of Kenya is promoting ICT usage to both the government and the Kenyan public through an
undersea and terrestrial cable and network installations, increased availability of mobile/wireless technology,
and a movement towards e-government services. However, the increased use of and reliance on ICT exposes
Kenya to increased cyber risks. Threat actors can exploit ICT vulnerabilities to perpetrate crimes against the
Government of Kenya and Kenya’s citizens who rely on ICT to perform electronic transactions or obtain key
critical government services. Also, natural disaster may pose a threat by causing potential damage critical
information infrastructure and disrupting communications. As such, it is imperative that as the Government of
Kenya protect critical information infrastructure. Its cybersecurity activities should also be flexible enough to
counter and mitigate the increasingly complex threats and vulnerabilities to ICT infrastructures.
The Government of Kenya is taking steps to increase the security and resilience of its critical information
infrastructure to protect its government, citizens and residents, and corporations from cyber threats and to
reap the social and economic benefits of cyberspace. The government is doing this through a coordinated

effort with other countries to increase the security of global
cyberspace as a whole. This includes securing critical
infrastructures, applications, and services. Additionally, the
Government of Kenya is working with relevant stakeholders
to build cybersecurity capabilities focused on operations,
infrastructure and mission assurance. Within the National
Cybersecurity Master Plan the Government has identified
a governance and capability structure (Figure 3) which will
support scalable growth of cybersecurity within the public and
private sectors.

Goal 2: Build National Capability
Objective: Awareness and Training: Inform and educate
the Kenyan public and workforce to secure the national
cyberspace
As part of building national capability goal, the Government
of Kenya is informing and educating the public and workforce
on how to secure the national cyberspace. This includes
partnering with other government organizations, the private
sector, and academia to ensure that people with cybersecurity
responsibilities possess the appropriate level of cyber
qualifications and competencies. This effort incorporates
human capital management, leadership development,
education and training, and strategic communication and
change management to develop a nation-wide workforce for
the future. Additionally, the Government of Kenya is:

Goal 3: Foster Information Sharing and Collaboration
Objective: Develop a comprehensive governance framework to leverage resources, reduce conflict and
duplication of effort, and work toward Kenya’s long-term cybersecurity goals
Cybersecurity is a complex, multidisciplinary challenge that requires coordination across a wide array of
stakeholders. Therefore, implementing the Strategy requires developing a comprehensive governance model
that includes meaningful participation by relevant stakeholders, working together toward the common goal
of securing Kenya’s cyberspace. Through this governance framework, the Government of Kenya intends to:

■■ Develop the required laws, regulations and policies required to secure the nation’s cyberspace;
■■ Solicits stakeholder input and feedback, as appropriate; and
■■ Balance information security, privacy considerations and economic priorities.
Cultivate a culture of information sharing that facilitates the real time exchange of cybersecurity information
Successful implementation of the Strategy requires the sharing of cybersecurity information (crossorganizational and cross-sector) in a trusted and structured manner. The Government of Kenya will develop
and manage a secure information-sharing capability to promote knowledge and lessons learned among
relevant stakeholders.

Goal 4: Provide National Leadership
Objective: Develop and Coordinate Implementation of the National Cybersecurity Strategy and Master Plan
Enhancing Kenya’s cybersecurity posture is a top priority for the Government of Kenya. As such, the Government
of Kenya will continue to provide a single, unified agenda that will guide all relevant national stakeholders.
Specifically, the ICT Ministry will:

■■ Continue to refresh the Strategy (vision, goals, and objectives), as required and establish a tactical
roadmap for achieving national cybersecurity objectives; and
■■ Use the Strategy, and complementary Cyber Security Master Plan to identify and implement relevant
cybersecurity initiatives, in conjunction and in collaboration with relevant stakeholders.

CONCLUSION
As Kenya’s remarkable ICT growth continues, ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of public
and private sector information across Kenya’s ICT infrastructure is of significant importance. Kenya’s
National Cybersecurity Strategy serves to demonstrate the government’s commitment to improving Kenya’s
cybersecurity posture and share overarching vision, goals, and objectives. Implementation of the strategy
is supported by an evolving national Cybersecurity Master Plan, which has been developed to define (and
ultimately govern) a prioritized roadmap of discreet cybersecurity projects.
Both the strategy and master plan are critical to securing the online environment for citizens, industry,
and foreign partners; increasing the Kenyan people’s confidence in online transactions, data security, fraud
protection, and privacy; encouraging greater foreign investment and enhancing trade opportunities; and
enabling Kenya’s broader economic and societal goals.
