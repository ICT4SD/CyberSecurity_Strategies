EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

 

Information and communications technologies and systems are one of the most important drivers of 
social and economical development today, whilst undoubtedly being necessary tools for the operation 
of functional and social structures in any country. As a result of this, a vital need is created for these 
technologies to offer security in their use, which is defined as the preservation of the principles of 
confidentiality, integrity and availability of information during its transmission, processing and 
storage. These principles lead to the building of trust in information systems and electronic services, 
which is considered a prerequisite for the continued development and growth in this valuable sector of 
the economy. Network and information security, and more generally cybersecurity, operates to 
maintain the above principles. 

This Strategy aims to establish a safe electronic environment in the Republic of Cyprus, with specific 
considerations and actions for the protection of critical information infrastructures, whose disruption 
or destruction would have severe consequences to vital societal functions. The development and 
preparation of this Strategy has followed a holistic approach for responding to threats in cyberspace, 
recognising that a valid strategy must offer multiple levels of security. 

The European Commission has set strong targets for the area of network and information security, 
which are evident from its intensified activities in this area, in cooperation with member states and with 
ENISA (European Network and Information Security Agency). The new European Regulatory Framework 
for Electronic Communications places special emphasis on the area of security and integrity of networks 
and services, and also on the area of protection of personal data. One of the main targets of the 
Commission is the development of National Strategies for network and information security (like this 
document), the development of National Contingency Plans for related matters and the creation of 
CERTs (Computer Emergency Response Teams) for incidents that involve electronic security breaches. 

Even though the area of network and information security is not a new one, and there have been a 
number of related actions by various competent state authorities in the past, this document represents 
the first organised approach for coordinated response to threats that manifest in cyberspace, on a 
National level. The following priority areas have been identified to meet this target: coordination of the 
governmental stakeholders, development of a complete legal framework, technical and procedural 
measures, capability development and training, productive collaboration between the public and 
private sector and the creation or adaptation of the necessary structures and instruments within the 
Cyprus Government. This strategy document contains a series of actions that have been identified to 
achieve the goals discussed above, in the following areas: 

. Organisational structures 
. Legal Framework 
. Collaboration between the public and private sectors 
. Identification of Critical Information Infrastructures 
. Threat landscape analysis 



. National Cybersecurity Framework 
. Incident response 
. National and International Cyber Exercises 
. Capability Development 
. Awareness 
. Cooperation with external agencies and international working groups 
. Development of a National Contingency Plan for Critical Information Infrastructures 
. Modelling and analysis of interdependencies. 


Short summaries of the Actions, together with an initial graphical assessment of the interdependencies 
between them, are presented in Appendices I and II respectively. 

This document also analyses the immediate actions that are to be taken within Phase A (see section 3.2), 
as well as the next steps that must follow, such as the detailed planning and costing for each action, the 
prioritisation and planning of the national cybersecurity programme, and the assessment of the results 
of the strategy actions that will follow. It should be noted that the Cybersecurity Strategy of the 
Republic of Cyprus will be reviewed on a regular basis, taking into account the results of the 
assessment process, as well as new threats that appear (and will continue to appear) in cyberspace. The 
targets are to perform a holistic assessment of the results of the above actions and to update the 
strategy accordingly so that it continues to be in a position to provide the maximum benefit to Cypriot 
society. 

 

 


1. INTRODUCTION 

1.1 Network and Information Security 

Information and communications technologies and systems are one of the most important drivers of 
social and economical development today, whilst undoubtedly being necessary tools for the operation 
of functional and social structures in any country. As cyberspace develops, the protection of the 
electronic systems present in organisations of all kinds becomes all the more important, so that any 
activity conducted through these systems is safe and secure. A basic security system must cover the 
confidentiality, integrity and high availability of infrastructure and information, while allowing the 
operation of the infrastructure to be reliable, flexible and controlled. Infrastructure security refers to 
the capability and resilience of the infrastructure against threats and malfunctions that may afflict its 
constituent parts. Relevant security measures that are taken mainly target the increase of readiness 
levels and the strengthening of preventative mechanisms, the identification and response to potential 
risks (including malicious actions or attacks), as well as putting in place measures for mitigation and 
recovery from malfunctions, failures and the availability of services that are offered, covering also 
emergency or crisis situations. 

In this document, the terms ‘network and information security’ and ‘cybersecurity’ are used. ‘Network 
and information security’ refers to the preservation of the principles of confidentiality, integrity and 
availability, as they are described below. ‘Cybersecurity’ refers to the broader security of networked 
systems that operate in cyberspace, i.e. in most cases connected to the Internet, and this term also 
covers the safe and secure usage of these systems by end users. 

It is clarified that the applicable level of information security must be guided through the determination 
of the value of the information to be protected (irrespective of the form of that information, whether it 
be physical or electronic). The value parameter will be taken into account during the implementation of 
the actions described in the present document, especially those that are related to informing people 
regarding security to foster awareness and a security culture. As a general principle, information must 
be protected appropriately, according to its value. 

Network and Information Security is a basic and necessary consequence of the development and 
pervasiveness of new information and communication technologies. Taking into account the 
globalisation of communications, especially with the use of the Internet but also the continuously 
increasing dangers that users are faced with at all levels, it has become vital to take adequate protection 
measures but also to ensure a high level of cooperation between all parts of society, the public and 
private sectors, on a national, European and international level. Citizens, businesses and governments 
strongly need to be able to trust the media through which important information and data, personal or 
otherwise, is transmitted. 

The safe development of information and communication technologies is important for citizens and 
societies, for growth in employment (and the economy in general), on the national but also the 


European and international level. Investments in the area of security serve to increase the trust of users 
in new services and contribute to the wider development of the economy and society itself. 
Governments, as well as businesses, must evaluate their investments in this area, with the basic 
criterion being the costs associated with failures of their information technology or communication 
systems against malicious actions or natural causes. 

‘Security’, in the information and communications technology world, generally refers to the 
preservation of three principles: 

. confidentiality of information, i.e. to only allow access to information to authorised persons, 
. integrity of information, i.e. the protection of information from any unwanted modification or 
destruction, 
. availability of information or systems, i.e. for a system to be able to provide service and/or 
information when it is requested. 


The preservation of the above principles aims to ensure network and information security to the highest 
possible degree, in relation to: 

. the protection of information/data in transit, 
. the protection of information/data in processing, 
. the protection of information/data in storage. 


Going beyond the protection of infrastructure, systems and information, the preservation of a high level 
of security, as per the principles described above, is necessary in order to built trust in information 
systems, communications and other electronic services that are offered by the government and other 
important organisations in Cyprus. The development of trust on behalf of citizens in these systems and 
ensuring secure transactions in cyberspace will contribute to a significant degree to the economic 
development of Cyprus and to meeting the targets of the Digital Agenda for Cyprus. 

1.2 Critical Information Infrastructures 

Information infrastructures have greatly increased in recent years in the Republic of Cyprus, and they 
have penetrated into almost every part of the life of the average citizen. These infrastructure are used 
not only directly (e.g. through the use of telephony, the Internet, etc.), but also indirectly, since almost 
all of the services that are offered by the government and used by citizens are heavily supported by 
them. Some of these information infrastructures form a critical part of Cypriot economy and society, 
either through the provision of vital goods and services, or forming a supporting platform for other 
(critical) infrastructures. These are thus considered to be critical information infrastructures, given that 
their disruption or destruction would have severe consequences to vital governmental and societal 
functions. 

It thus becomes necessary, via a wider framework of a cybersecurity strategy of a country, to place 
special emphasis on the protection of such critical information infrastructures. A number of actions that 
are described in the present document cover the protection of critical information infrastructures, and 


also the wider area of cybersecurity, given that these two areas are closely related and always interact 
with each other. 

Section 3.6 describes, in further detail, the criteria that will be used to identify the critical information 
infrastructures in the Republic of Cyprus. The work that will follow for the development of a National 
Contingency Plan for critical information infrastructures is described in section 3.14 and forms a priority 
of this strategic plan. 

1.3 Vision 

The vision of the Cybersecurity Strategy of the Republic of Cyprus is the operation of information and 
communications technologies in Cyprus with the necessary levels of security, to the benefit of every user. 

1.4 Aims and Objectives 

The development of this strategy and the actions that have been identified have the following aims and 
objectives: 

. the development and preservation of a safe and secure electronic business environment in 
Cyprus, 
. support of the targets of the government that have been identified in the ‘Digital Cyprus’ 
strategy programme to develop conditions for an Information Society, 
. the development of trust, on behalf of citizens and organisations/businesses, in e-government 
services, including the preservation of information and data in transit, processing and storage, 
. the establishment of a safe electronic environment in the Republic of Cyprus for all of its 
citizens, including children, 
. the mitigation of the effects of threats in cyberspace and the effective response to emergencies, 
. the support of a future coordinated national response plan for the protection of critical 
infrastructures (beyond ICT) in the Republic of Cyprus. 


1.5 Guiding Principles 

The structure and contents of this document are based on the following guiding principles: 

. the development of strategy and policy within a framework of cooperation between all 
competent authorities, taking into account the competences of each governmental stakeholder, 
. the development of a holistic approach to face threats in cyberspace, 
. the recognition that a valid strategy must offer multiple levels of security (layered security, 
defence in depth, etc.), 
. the use of open processes in all stages of implementation of the Strategy, 
. and the setting of ambitious goals with the will for the Strategy and its actions to contribute 
tangibly to the improvement of the levels of electronic security in Cyprus. 



2. STRATEGIC CONTEXT 

2.1 European Policy 

Security matters form an important pillar of the Digital Agenda for Europe, and this specific European 
policy covers a number of important topics related to network and information security. The position of 
the European Commission regarding these issues is covered in detail in the strategy document for 
Network and Information Security (NIS). In addition to this, and as part of the application of European 
policy in this area, the European Network and Information Security Agency (ENISA) was created and has 
been operational since 2004. This organisation is headquartered in Herakleion, Crete and it develops 
pan-European and international actions in the area of network and information security, helping the 
application of European policy, the dissemination of information and best practices, the harmonisation 
and coordination of common actions, the organisation and execution of European and international 
cyber exercises and also international cooperation and coordination. The renewal of ENISA’s operations 
(in time), with expanded terms of mandate, is the subject of intensive consultations during this period at 
the Council of Ministers level, and also in the European Parliament, given that everyone recognises the 
necessity of such an organisation to exist and operate in Europe. 

The new European Regulatory Framework for Electronic Communications (with a May 2011 date of 
entry into force on a pan-European level), places special emphasis on the area of security, mainly in 
topics relating to: (a) the security and integrity of networks and services, as well as the application of 
regulatory measures and cooperation mechanisms on a national and pan-European level, together with 
national notification mechanisms for security breach incidents, contained in the Framework Directive 
(2002/21/EC, as amended), and (b) the security of personal data, the processing of such data and 
related security breaches, the protection of data contained within customer terminal equipment, and 
the use of automated calling systems and communication without human intervention, contained in the 
Directive on Privacy and Electronic Communications (2002/58/EC, as amended). 

Additionally, cybersecurity matters have recently been placed high on the agenda of the 
Telecommunications Ministerial1 Council of the European Union. The Council, during its recent 
meetings, has examined policy and the actions to follow, including the preparation of new Directives in 
the area of security and especially for Critical Information Infrastructure Protection (CIIP). 

1 The finalisation of the new European Strategy for Internet Security will form part of the activities of the 
Telecommunications Ministerial Council under the Cyprus Presidency of the Council. 

The Council has also requested the cooperation between Member States, the European Commission and 
third countries for: (a) the identification and securing of parts of critical infrastructure that could, if 
damaged or destroyed, have severe negative effects on member states, and (b) the exchange of 
information and best practices, while (c) urging member states to encourage effective cooperation 
between public and private sector entities, both within the member states themselves and with third 


countries. The Council has also asked to be updated, together with the European Parliament, on an 
annual basis by member states and the European Commission regarding their actions in these matters. 

After the meeting of the Telecommunications Ministerial Council on the 27th of May 2011, in which 
these matters were discussed, the European Commission announced the actions that it expects the 
member states of the European Union to undertake, asking for the commitment of all those involved for 
the promotion of common goals. Specifically, the European Commission is requesting that member 
states and the Council state their strong commitment to the improvement and strengthening of national 
security in cyberspace to the best of their abilities, with the target of securing a high level of protection 
within the European Union and more effective collaboration on the international level. 

As such, the European Commission is planning to monitor the performance of the member states 
closely, as regards meeting the three basic targets that are being promoted on the European level: 

 (a) The operation of national / governmental Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) in 
each member state and the creation of a common and functional network of national / governmental 
CERTs in Europe by 2012, which will be supported by effective national cybersecurity strategies. 

 (b) The organisation of regular national and pan-European exercises for security in cyberspace 
(with CERTs participating as a prerequisite), in which a pan-European cyber exercise which has been 
scheduled for the second half of 2012 is included. 

 (c) The development of national contingency plans for network and information security, and 
incidents in cyberspace, and the contribution of all member states to the development of a European 
contingency plan for emergencies in cyberspace within 2012. Based on national experiences, such a 
plan must lay the foundation and define appropriate processes for effective communications between 
member states in situations where common threats and malicious attacks affect a number of member 
states. 

On a national level, the actions described in points (b) and (c) above form part of the actions that are 
included in this Strategy. The action referred to in point (a) above is already in progress in the Republic 
of Cyprus and is regulated by separate secondary legislation that is published by the Commissioner for 
Electronic Communications and Postal Regulation, while the correct operation of CERTs/CSIRTs in Cyprus 
is a basic precondition for the development of the strategic planning that is described in this document. 
These same points were the subject of a special Ministerial Conference that took place in Hungary in 
April 2011, in the context of the work plans of the Presidency of the Council and of the European 
Commission during the first half of 2011. All member states were represented at this conference, which 
was under the auspices of the Telecommunications Ministerial Council and under the area of network 
and information security. The conference conclusions cover the duties of the member states in detail, 
as described in this section. Specifically regarding the matters related to CERTs, the conference 
conclusions state that: 


«put in place well-functioning and operational national/governmental CERTs as soon as possible; 
provide technical support to the EU institutions in setting up their own CERT by 2012; establish a well-
functioning network of CERTs at EU level, which will include the CERT for the EU institutions;». 

In summary, the European Union, in recent years, has been planning, preparing and executing actions to 
strengthen its position in relation to cybersecurity. Its aim is to effectively handle the rapidly increasing 
rates of crimes and attacks in cyberspace, and the European Commission is asking from member state 
governments to seriously examine the issue of security in cyberspace. 

The statement of Neelie Kroes, Vice-President of the European Commission for the Digital Agenda on 
the EU website is indicative: 

"Cyber-attacks are a very real and ever-increasing threat. Whether against individual countries, 
companies or most recently against the European Commission, they can paralyse key infrastructure and 
cause huge long-term damage”. She also added that: “Setting up this CERT pre-configuration team is a 
further demonstration of how seriously the EU Institutions take the cyber-security threat." 

2.2 Network and Information Security in the Republic of Cyprus 

The Republic of Cyprus and especially the Ministry of Communications and Works (MCW), and the 
competent coordinating authority2 for Network and Information Security in Cyprus, which is the Office 
of the Commissioner of Electronic Communications and Postal Regulation (OCECPR), have recognised 
the essential role of security topics in the promotion of new communications services, the use of new 
technologies and more generally in the development of an information society. Towards this end, a 
number of specific actions and policies have been promoted on the national level: 

2 Based on the provisions of the legislation that pervades its operations, OCECPR is responsible for the security of 
electronic communications infrastructures, as well as for the information that is transmitted through or stored 
within them. 

3 Policy Document on Network and Information security 2006 

4 Policy Document on the Formation of Emergency Response Teams for Incidents related to Network and 
Information Security (CSIRT/CERT) 2010 

(a) In 2006, the Ministry of Communications and Works (MCW) approved a policy document3, 
through which a number of specific actions in the area of network and information security are 
promoted, via OCECPR: the formation of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs / CSIRTs), the 
creating of an institutional framework for the security and integrity of information infrastructures, and 
the raising of awareness of all stakeholders and Cypriot society about relevant security matters. 

(b) In 2010, upon recommendations by OCECPR which were received favourably by ENISA, MCW 
also approved a detailed policy document4 regarding the operation of a governmental and an academic 
CERT. The Cypriot CERTs are being formed with the extension potential to cover the private business 
sector at a later stage. The founding of the CERTs has been formalised via secondary legislation 
P.I.358/2010. 


(c) Within 2012, new provisions are being introduced into The Regulation of Electronic 
Communications and Postal Services Law of 2004 (112(I)2004), which stem from the new Regulatory 
Framework for Electronic Communications5 and which cover matters related to network and 
information security. These new provisions have been applied, on a European level, since 25th May 
2011. 

5 "Better Regulation" Directive 2009/140/EC, .a. "Citizens' Rights" Directive 2009/136/EC 

6 See ‘Digital Cyprus’ document, as approved by the Council of Ministers in February 2012. 

(d) The Republic of Cyprus, in cooperation with the relevant stakeholders, has committed, via 
the Telecommunications Ministerial Council, to contribute to European and international collaboration 
for responding to threats and challenges in cyberspace. 

The National Cybersecurity Strategy that is described in this document adopts and complements the 
actions discussed above. Based on the provisions of this strategy and the priorities of the Republic of 
Cyprus, the actions related to network and information security form part of the wider strategy for the 
development of an Information Society6, and will also allow for Cyprus to contribute actively in the 
planning process for protecting European critical information infrastructures from 2012 onwards. 

2.3 Competent/Related Authorities and Observers of the Republic 
of Cyprus 

Beyond the policies and actions that are mentioned in section 2.2, there are a number of authorities 
within the Republic of Cyprus that are active in the security of networks, services, information 
technology systems and information itself, in addition to having direct or indirect input on critical 
security matters. Each authority has direct or indirect responsibilities in the area of network and 
information security, as well as interdependencies between them that must be taken into account for 
the implementation of this strategy. 

The competent/related authorities that are involved at this stage are the following: 

. Office of the Commissioner of Electronic Communications and Postal Regulation (OCECPR) 
. Department of Information Technology Services (DITS) 
. Cyprus Police 
. National Guard General Staff 
. National Security Authority 
. Central Intelligence Service 
. Office of the Commissioner for Personal Data Protection 
. Ministry of Communications and Works (MCW) 
. Department of Electronic Communications (DEC) 
. Civil Defence Force 
. Cyprus Fire Service 
. Unit for Combating Money Laundering 



The following authorities of the Republic of Cyprus are to be kept informed of the activities described 
herein and are observers at this stage: 

. Law Office of the Republic of Cyprus 
. Auditor General 
. Internal Audit Service 
. Central Bank of Cyprus. 


It is noted that the competent authority of the Republic of Cyprus that has responsibilities relating to 
Classified Information (CI) and European Union Classified Information (EU CI) is the National Security 
Authority. Even though this document is not aimed exclusively or directly at the protection of Classified 
Information, any electronic transmission of such information is essentially implemented through 
communications infrastructure of communications service providers. 

2.4 Threats in Cyberspace Today 

The use of computers and communications systems has nowadays penetrated our lives to a very high 
degree, and so our level of dependence on these technologies for much of our daily activity is 
increasing. These technologies are used today in many sectors beyond just for communications: they 
are used for the production and distribution of energy, the management of water and sewage systems, 
financial services, in the armed forces and law enforcement, governmental departments and services, 
health services, etc. Even though the benefits stemming from information and communications 
technologies (ICT) are huge, new network technologies have introduced a plethora of security issues 
that are taken advantage of by malicious actors that target vulnerabilities in infrastructure and network 
components, such as computers, routers, switches, etc. 

The last few years have seen multiple threats appearing in communications networks, especially with 
the explosion in the use of the Internet by citizens. ICT has been used in malicious ways for theft from 
bank accounts, access to confidential information, damage to important websites (consequent denial of 
access to the public), etc. Examples of information that has been stolen from companies include 
confidential contracts, product designs, credit card information, account numbers and other personal 
data. Such incidents can induce severe damages to an organisation, given that its reputation and 
customer trust can be seriously affected, in addition to any direct (monetary) damages. The probability 
of such incidents occurring can however be significantly reduced if appropriate measures are taken by 
an organisation or enterprise. 

It has been observed, on a global level, that not only is the frequency of attacks in cyberspace 
increasing, but also the complexity of such attacks. The public, in most cases, is not aware of the extent 
of these attacks, nor of the damages that can be caused by them. A relatively recent phenomenon that 
is being observed in cyberspace is that of ‘botnets’ – automated virtual networks involving large 
numbers of computers (some have been reported with tens of thousands of ‘members’) that are 
controlled by malicious actors. These computers can be found in homes and businesses, and also 


perhaps in governmental departments, without the users themselves being aware or having knowledge 
of this, and they are being used for large scale attacks in cyberspace. 

In addition to the consequences to persons as described above, it is not difficult for problems to be 
created for nation states themselves. Interference with a nation state’s communications has always 
been an inextricable part of military conflicts. Nowadays, given that many of an army’s communications 
systems include computers, some nation states have already developed electronic weapons for attacks 
in cyberspace that can be used as part of a wider military offensive (or even for terrorist actions if they 
fall into the wrong hands). In addition to this, any vulnerabilities in the ICT systems of the armed forces 
could lead to the leak of very sensitive information to unauthorised users. The operations of modern 
military forces are dependent on ICT to a large extent and a serious cyber attack could have dramatic 
consequences to the defensive capabilities of a country. The strength, stability and safe operations of a 
country are now fully dependent on the smooth running of its infrastructures, and as can be seen from 
the examples mentioned above, cyber attacks cannot be ignored. 

It is noted that the strategic response (see section 3) and the actions described in this document do not 
relate to the handling of military issues in network and information security, nor to the handling of 
related terrorism issues; however, the examples discussed above serve to highlight the level of 
dependence on the technologies that are discussed in this document that military networks and 
information have. 

 


3. STRATEGIC RESPONSE 

3.1 Priority Areas 

The strategic response of the Republic of Cyprus to the previously mentioned threats can be split into a 
number of priority areas that have been identified for the optimal protection of critical information 
infrastructures. The areas that have been prioritised in relation to the needs of the Republic of Cyprus 
are the following, as shown in Figure 1: 

 

Figure 1: Priorities of the Cybersecurity Strategy of the Republic of Cyprus 

 

Legal Framework 

 

Technical and Organisational 
Measures and Procedures 

 

 

Capability Development 

 

 

Immediate Response to 
Significant Incidents 

Coordination of 
governmental 
stakeholders 

Productive Collaboration between the Public and Private Sector 

 

. coordination of governmental stakeholders to ensure correct and efficient cooperation, 
. creation of a comprehensive legal framework by the competent authorities of the state, that 
covers all aspects of network and information security, including cybercrime and the protection 
of personal data, 
. formulation of technical and organisational measures and procedures to harden the security of 
relevant hardware, software and physical spaces, to the required degree, 



. development of the necessary skills, training and awareness in security topics, for those that 
are directly involved and also for the public, 
. productive collaboration between the public and private sector, on both the national and 
international level, 
. creation or adaptation of the necessary structures and instruments within the competent 
authorities and the more generally the Cyprus Government, to secure the demands and 
capabilities of immediate incident response. 


3.2 Splitting the Actions – Phases A and B 

The rest of this chapter presents the actions that have been identified for the implementation of the 
strategic plan. Current organisational structures and available resources are not at a level that would 
allow an immediate start to all of the actions that have been identified, and as such each action 
description that follows also indicates the phase in which it will be executed: 

. Phase A 
o Phase A includes all of the actions that OCECPR is in a position to start in the immediate 
future with the resources that are currently available to it. 


. Phase B 
o Phase B includes the actions that OCECPR will be in a position to coordinate once a new 
organisational structure has been developed, with the necessary resources to carry out 
the implementation of this Strategy in its entirety. 




Each action description mentions the phase in which it will be executed and the actions that mention 
both phases will be partly completed in each phase. It is noted that this does not mean that actions 
implemented in Phase A will necessarily be completed within that phase. The majority of the actions of 
this Strategy will continue to be executed on a long-term basis for the continued protection of 
cyberspace in Cyprus. 

3.3 Organisational Structure 

The area of network and information security is a very large and complicated subject, and one which 
involves a number of stakeholders, as shown in section 2.3. Each competent or relevant authority has 
its own areas of responsibility and it is important to uphold these differences. However, due to this 
multi-stakeholder approach to security matters, it is vital for all involved to understand and accept that 
the maintenance of acceptable levels of security in the electronic world can be accomplished only via 
cooperation between the different stakeholders involved, within a framework of coordinated response 
to the various threats that have already been mentioned. 

It follows that the coordination of the competent or relevant governmental authorities is absolutely 
necessary. This coordination activity is productive when performed by an entity which is in a position to 
organise and coordinate the various actions of the Republic of Cyprus for correct response to the threats 
that are around today, as well as rising and new threats in cyberspace. This entity must have: 


. the appropriate legal authority and defined responsibility in order to carry out its duties, 
. the necessary skills and capabilities to respond appropriately to the obligations of the role, 
. the necessary links and good working relationships with the competent or relevant authorities 
of the Republic, the electronic communications providers in Cyprus, the private sector 
stakeholders and international working groups and fora that are relevant to the area of 
cybersecurity. 


Taking into account the fact that the definition and creating of an integrated and complete 
organisational structure is necessary for the optimum implementation of the strategic actions, but also 
that the processes involved to accomplish this are affected by external factors related to the current 
severe financial crisis that is manifesting in Cyprus, and the lengthy recruitment procedures involved, 
the implementation of such an organisational structure will form part of Phase B of the strategy 
activities. This will have the following benefits: 

. The planning and executing of the actions that have been identified as being of an urgent nature 
and with immediate priority, for which the legal framework is already in place, will not be 
delayed. 
. Existing structures will be leveraged to the maximum extent possible, with gradual upgrading of 
their capabilities to the required level. 
. The associated financial burden will be gradual and in line with the capabilities of the Cyprus 
economy. 
. Cypriot authorities will be in a position to fulfil their commitments both on the national and 
European level, where relevant activities are being pushed forward with rapid and demanding 
timelines. 
. The necessary time will be given for the appropriate needs assessment, in relation to the 
requirements for the strategy implementation, the coordination of activities and the supervision 
of incident response mechanisms and related actions. 


Phase A will formulate the cooperation framework between OCECPR, as the coordinating body, and the 
other competent authorities for the implementation of the high priority actions, such as developing the 
plan for the protection of critical information infrastructures, the operation of the governmental 
CSIRT/CERT, the assessment and improvement of the readiness levels of network infrastructures as 
regards their resilience to risk and their response to security threats, the handling and notification of 
security incidents on networks, systems and information, and the organisation of national exercises with 
additional participation in European exercises. These activities refer to the wider responsibilities that 
OCECPR has in the area of network and information security, and section 2.2 discusses the specific 
actions that have been prioritised and have been included in this strategy. At this point, an agreed basis 
for cooperation is required between the competent authorities, and which will be expanded and 
adjusted as the strategy programme progresses. 


Action 1 - Phase A – Formulation of the framework for collaboration and information exchange 
with OCECPR, and between public authorities, so that OCECPR will be in a position to effectively 
coordinate the nation’s strategic response in the area of cybersecurity and the protection of 
critical information infrastructures, as well as coordinating the actions that relate to other 
stakeholders in the priority areas that can be addressed immediately. 




 

The way that existing activities in the area of network and information security, that fall under the 
responsibilities of OCECPR, are planned and executed is based on its existing organisational structure. 
The present structure and resources are not adequate to take on and execute all of the actions that are 
described in this document. As a result of this, and in tandem with pushing forward with the immediate 
priorities based on current urgent national and European commitments and needs of the Republic of 
Cyprus, OCECPR, in cooperation with the other competent authorities in the Republic, will study and 
submit recommendations regarding new policy for its reorganisation to the Minister of Communications 
and Works, so that it will be in a position to fully coordinate the very large volume of work associated 
with the areas of network and information security and cybersecurity. 

Action 2 - Phase A – OCECPR will, at the appropriate time and in cooperation with the other 
competent authorities, develop a report regarding new policy for its reorganisation, so that it 
will be in a position to fully coordinate the efforts of the Republic of Cyprus for optimum 
implementation, application and supervision of all of the actions and the effective response to 
threats that are prevalent in cyberspace today, as well as rising threats that will appear in the 
future. 




 

OCECPR will also coordinate the formation of a number of working groups, which will take over the 
implementation of the rest of the actions that are described herein. These working groups will be 
staffed by personnel with the necessary technical and other skills from the competent authorities of the 
state, as well as by experts from the private sector and representatives of critical information 
infrastructure operators (see also section 3.5). 

For the identification and assessment of potential risks, it may be the case that the members of some of 
the working groups might need access to classified information; that is the information that refers to 
vulnerabilities in critical parts of each network or system that will be deemed as important or critical. 
Taking into account that the relevant risk assessments must be conducted in tandem with the 
development of plans to respond to incidents relating to these risks, and also the development of 
contingency plans to mitigate the effects of related disasters, the composition of the working groups 
must be such that confidentiality is assured. 


Action 3 - Phase A/B – Formation of working groups, with representatives from the public and 
private sectors (as necessary), to implement the Strategy Actions. 




 

3.4 Legal Framework 

Legislation in the Republic of Cyprus already covers a large number of areas relating to network and 
information security, as well as cybercrime (and other electronic crime) matters. However, it is still 
considered necessary to identify all relevant laws in Cyprus and to update them where needed, and also 
to promote the creation of new primary and secondary legislation to cover all of the provisions of this 
Strategy. This legislation (whether new or updated) must cover processes for the prevention, 
deterrence and dynamic response to all forms of cybercrime, and also be harmonised with the relevant 
law and directives of the European Union. 

International cooperation with other member states of the European Union, as well as third countries, 
will be required in the areas of network and information security and the protection of critical 
information infrastructures. As such, specific legal issues may arise regarding the processing and 
handling of electronic threats whose sources could be outside of the boundaries of the Republic of 
Cyprus. It is thus considered necessary to create an appropriate legal infrastructure also regarding the 
effective cooperation with entities outside Cyprus to solve related problems as they arise. 

Action 4 - Phase B – Creation of an appropriate legal framework to fully support the provisions 
of the Cybersecurity Strategy. All relevant laws of the competent authorities must be assessed 
for any updated needs. 




3.5 Cooperation between the State and the Private Sector 

The State will make significant efforts in the area of network and information security, and especially on 
the topic of critical information infrastructure protection within Cyprus. The strategic initiative in these 
areas can only come from the State, which is responsible for ensuring the cooperation between relevant 
stakeholders on a national and international level. 

The State recognises that the role of the private sector in the security and protection of critical 
information infrastructures is extremely important, for the following reasons: 

. The private sector (including the semi-governmental electronic communications provider) 
operates the majority of the critical communications infrastructure of the government, e.g. the 



public communications networks that are used by the different government departments, as 
well as by the business and academic worlds, and the citizens of the Republic. 
. The State relies on the private sector, not only for the communications networks, but also for 
the provision of the equipment that it uses, and for the implementation of many of activities 
that are related to network and information security, whether those are conducted as a matter 
of course for security reasons or for the reliable operation of their systems and services, or they 
are imposed on the operators via legal and / or regulatory measures. 
. It is considered a given that the private sector contains accumulated technical know-how and 
specialised human resources, and there are also organisations that can help and contribute to 
the best possible development of the Republic of Cyprus in these areas. 


Taking the above into consideration, the Republic of Cyprus sets a high priority on consultation with the 
private sector for the achievement of its goals, the implementation of the provisions of this Strategy, the 
continuous improvement of the actions and effects of the Strategy, as well as for the gaining of further 
technical skills and specialisation. 

Action 5 - Phase A/B – Comprehensive survey of the private sector, for the identification of 
groups and stakeholders that can contribute in a positive way to the improvement of the levels 
of electronic security in the Republic of Cyprus, while simultaneously creating the conditions for 
developing close collaborative relationships. 




 

During the execution of the Action described above, the State will seek out cooperation with existing 
competent authorities which determine the way that important sectors operate, such as the Central 
Bank of Cyprus regarding the banking sector. In addition to this, a mechanism for providing regular 
updates to the private sector will be put in place, regarding the progress being made in the planned 
actions, to help achieve convergence in the activities of the public and private sectors regarding the 
provisions of this Strategy. 

Beyond what has been described above, the PPP (Public-Private Partnership) model is emphasised, 
which is considered on a European and international level to be an effective model of cooperation 
between entities in the public and private sectors. With the requisite preparatory work, the possibility 
of creating a dynamic PPP in the area of critical information infrastructure protection will be 
investigated, and which will: 

. contribute to the development of trust between the public and private sectors in the area of 
network and information security, 
. create a safe cooperation framework to achieve common security goals, 
. facilitate the exchange of information related to new threats in cyberspace and solutions for 
their avoidance, 
. allow cooperation in research and innovation in related topics, 



. help to set ambitious but feasible targets for the realising the vision of the Strategy, 
. cooperate with PPPs in other member states of the European Union in the same area, via active 
participation in related working groups. 


Action 6 - Phase B – Investigate the possibility of creating a dynamic PPP (Public-Private 
Partnership) in the area of critical information infrastructure protection in the Republic of 
Cyprus and promote active cooperation with international entities through participation in 
international fora. The use of the PPP to foster trust between the State and private sector will 
be of primary importance. 




3.6 Identification of Critical Information Infrastructures 

The need for the protection of critical information infrastructures, as highlighted and explained in this 
document, is necessary to minimize the negative impacts and possible catastrophic consequences of 
malicious acts or natural disasters on infrastructure, on a national level within the Republic of Cyprus 
but also because of potential negative effects to other countries, as a consequence of the high levels of 
interconnection and interdependence between international communications networks. The question 
is raised as to which particular infrastructures should be considered (and designated) as ‘critical’. Each 
stakeholder (electronic communications companies, governmental departments and services, security 
forces, armed forces, hospitals, financial institutions, energy and water providers, etc.) will consider 
their infrastructure as vitally important and the ideal situation would be the complete and total 
protection of all information infrastructures in the Republic of Cyprus, without exception. 

However, given that such an approach is not feasible, it is necessary to identify and assess the truly 
critical infrastructures within the Republic of Cyprus and to target them for the best possible protection. 
These critical infrastructures will be identified and assessed based on a number of predetermined 
criteria. For the determination of these criteria, as well as national conditions, related activities of the 
European Commission and ENISA (European Network and Information Security Agency) will also be 
taken into consideration, with the appropriate adaptation for Cyprus. The public sector, as well as the 
private sector, must contribute to the determination and assessment of critical information 
infrastructures, within the boundaries of the relevant working group(s). 

The steps that will be followed for the identification of critical information infrastructures will include 
the following: 

. Determination of services that will be targeted (e.g. voice communications, data 
communications, data storage, data processing), that could be classed as critical, 
. Identification of infrastructures that are technically indispensable for the operation of these 
services, 
. Introduction of objective criteria for the level of protection that each infrastructure element 
needs, with categorisation of infrastructures and the use of criteria such as the number of 



affected users, the sensitivity level of the information that is concentrated, stored, transmitted 
or processed on these infrastructures, etc. 
. check the criteria with the development of scenarios that consider the disruption of operation 
of selected infrastructure, within the bounds of regular exercises. 


Action 7 - Phase A – Identification and assessment of the critical information infrastructures in 
the republic of Cyprus, to better target activities and actions for their protection, with the 
contribution of both the public and private sectors. 




3.7 Threat Landscape Analysis 

Section 2.4 mentioned the general threats that can manifest in cyberspace. It is important to note that 
available information on the specific mix of threats that appear in Cyprus and which can rise in the 
future is limited. The protection of information infrastructures can be achieved through general 
measures only (to some extent), but the strategic response to threats in cyberspace will be greatly 
improved if the main threats that are actually present and manifest in Cyprus become known. This will 
not only allow better targeting of response measures, but also better targeting of the most prevalent 
threats if the necessary protective controls are put in place gradually through a feasible implementation 
programme for the provisions of this Strategy. 

A comprehensive threat landscape and attack analysis is therefore necessary (including attacks that are 
widespread in Cyprus and other European countries), so that the improved targeting of response 
methods can be achieved, as discussed above. This analysis will be combined with the most prevalent 
threats that are discussed in European and other international reports for a more complete and 
comprehensive review. 

Action 8 - Phase B – Comprehensive survey to record current threats and attacks in cyberspace 
that have been published in Cyprus, as well as monitoring new threats that appear in the 
European and international space. 




3.8 National Cybersecurity Framework 

The easiest and most effective method to achieve an acceptable level of security in all critical 
information infrastructures in the Republic of Cyprus is to develop a National Cybersecurity Framework, 
which will be used as the basis for the protection of critical information infrastructures, and for 
information assurance. This framework must be developed based on international security standards 
and include the following (among others): 


. Governance and risk management 
. Vulnerability assessment 
. Regular penetration testing 
. Management of physical spaces, hardware and software 
. Appropriate staff authorisation 
. Physical security and environmental management 
. Making use of CERTs for incident management (see section 3.9) 
. Continuous monitoring of electronic communications for malicious attacks to determine 
incidents in progress. 


This Framework must be adopted by all operators of critical information infrastructures, and must also 
be examined for adoption by all government departments and other important organisations in Cyprus. 
To achieve this target, the National Cybersecurity Framework will be developed in such a way so that it 
can be promoted within the remainder of the private sector, for the optimum protection of all those 
that use electronic communications services. 

Action 9 - Phase B – Development of a National Cybersecurity Framework which will promote 
the protection of critical information infrastructures in the Republic of Cyprus, as well as 
governmental departments and services. 




 

It should be noted that the specific targets that will be set for the protection levels for these 
technologies and systems will be determined based on appropriate risk analysis and balancing these 
levels with the associated cost of implementing specific controls to respond to threats in cyberspace. A 
usual method used is to keep the related annual costs below the annual estimated cost of damages or 
losses if these threats were to manifest on information and communications networks and systems. 

3.9 Incident Response 

Ensuring the full functionality of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs/CSIRTs) within Cyprus is 
an integral and vital part of this Strategy, and also of meeting our commitments as a nation. 

The main functions of a CERT are the prevention of serious incidents related to network and information 
security, as well as the immediate and appropriate response to such incidents when they occur. It is 
emphasised that for the correct operation of a CERT/CSIRT, the following are required: (a) necessary 
infrastructure and (b) staffing with appropriately trained (to a very high level) personnel. A basic 
prerequisite for such services to operate effectively is strong support from the State. 

The cooperation between CERTs/CSIRTs that operate in each member state lies within the framework of 
European cooperation in the area of information security. Given the target of integrating Cypriot 


CERTs/CSIRTs into these cooperation mechanisms, their full functionality must be ensured so that they 
may gain the necessary certifications to allow their participated in relevant European working groups. 

Action 10 - Phase A – Ensure the full functionality of Computer Emergency Response Teams 
(CERTs/CSIRTs), with immediate priority for the operation of the Governments CERT/CSIRT. 
Necessary certifications and memberships will be obtained to allow their participation in 
relevant European working groups. 




 

Action 11 - Phase B – Assessment by OCECPR, in cooperation with the CERTs/CSIRTs, of 
expanding their activities or creating new CERTs/CSIRTs to cover the needs of the private sector 
and the business community. 




3.10 National and International Cyber Exercises 

The significant need for cooperation between the government and different stakeholders, both within 
the public and private sectors, has been examined in sections 3.3 and 3.5. The development of this 
cooperation, and especially of associated trust, is of the utmost importance. 

However, it is not enough to just create the necessary cooperation mechanisms, if these mechanisms 
are not assessed and tested on a regular basis, especially via the emulation of crisis situations. The 
completion of such exercises has proven to be a very valuable tool for ensuring the readiness levels of 
the competent authorities to handle a potential crisis, e.g. the loss of a significant part of a large 
communications network. Exercises that have been conducted so far in other member states, and also 
on a pan-European level, have shown that the mechanisms to face such a crisis already exist; the missing 
piece of the puzzle is usually the cooperation and coordination modalities between the competent 
authorities involved, i.e. who will communicate with whom in a crisis situation, how can rapid 
cooperation between the involved authorities specifically be achieved, etc. 

The need for completing cyber exercises that involve handling realistic scenarios (where the players 
involved have no a priori knowledge of the events that are to follow) has been recognised on the 
European level and the first pan-European cyber exercise (Cyber Europe 2010) has already taken place. 
The Republic of Cyprus has much to gain for organising and actively participating in such cyber exercises. 
Naturally, this gain is maximised with the organisation of similar national exercises with realistic 
scenarios. The completing of such exercises will contribute to the maximisation of the Republic’s 
readiness levels to withstand significant events in the area of network and information security that 
could potentially affect a large part of the population. 


It is noted that the element of confidentiality must be taken into account during all cooperation and 
exchange of information and experiences with international organisations and working groups, as 
described in section 3.3 regarding the formation of the working groups. 

Action 12 - Phase A – Planning and organisation of regular national cybersecurity exercises, 
with increasingly realistic scenarios, as well as active participation in pan-European and other 
international cyber exercises. 




3.11 Training and Capability Development 

The appropriate technical training and development of capabilities in the cyberspace security area is a 
necessary prerequisite for the smooth operation of security systems, as well as for the correct 
implementation of any actions related to this theme. The development of such capabilities is of major 
importance and the target is to create a suitable workforce, both within and outside of the public sector, 
which will have the necessary technical know-how and experience to implement the provisions of this 
Strategy. 

As such, the government will support the appropriate personnel training in the area of electronic 
security, via the following actions: 

. Identification of appropriate (and available) training programmes and certifications, 
. Promote the uptake of such programmes within the government, 
. Creation of a suitable workforce with the necessary specialised knowledge, 
. Inclusion of relevant certifications and experience into job descriptions that relate to electronic 
security, 
. Support activities in Cypriot higher education institutions in the area of network and information 
security, through the inclusion of electronic security topics in their curricula and the institution 
of related research programmes. 


It is noted that this action refers to the education and training of professionals in the area of 
cybersecurity and not in awareness raising measures for the public (see section 3.12). 

Action 13 - Phase B – Development of suitable human resources that will have the necessary 
technical know-how and certifications to implement the provisions of this Strategy to a high 
level, in the mid- and long-term, and inclusion of these skills and certifications into the job 
descriptions for related positions. 





3.12 Security Culture (Awareness) 

The dimensions of potential threats to cybersecurity, as discussed in section 2.4, clearly show that this 
issue concerns all users of information infrastructures, given that any connected computer could serve 
as an entry point or malicious and/or harmful elements to local cyberspace. This includes the vast 
majority of the citizens of the Republic of Cyprus, given that most of them today makes use of the 
Internet on a regular basis. 

It is very important for Internet users, as well as users of IT systems in every workplace have a 
satisfactory level of knowledge/awareness regarding the potential threats that they must protect 
themselves from. 

The Republic of Cyprus will promote a National Awareness Programme for cybersecurity matters, which 
will include the following: 

. Creation of informational material, as well as use of existing (and available) material from 
external sources (e.g. ENISA), for citizens regarding safe and secure Internet use, with a focus on 
the protection of personal data, ethical behaviour in cyberspace and protection of children on 
the Internet, 
. Distribution of this informational material through multiple media, e.g. television, radio, SMS, 
websites, leaflets/booklets, lectures, etc. 
. Development of small duration training seminars for working professionals, 
. Development of specialised training seminars for governmental users of IT systems that contain 
sensitive and/or classified information, 
. Promotion of the development of a positive security culture in all government departments and 
services, as well as in private businesses. 


Action 14 - Phase B – Development of a comprehensive National Awareness Programme for 
cybersecurity matters, covering all users of electronic systems, from governmental workers to 
citizens of the State. 




 

Reaching the appropriate level of knowledge and awareness in Cyprus, combined with the development 
of skilled human resources for key positions, will contribute significantly in the long run to securing IT 
systems that are part of cyberspace. 

3.13 Cooperation with External Agencies and International Working 
Groups 

As has been discussed extensively previously in section 3.5, cooperation of the main body responsible 
for ensuring the security of cyberspace in the Republic of Cyprus with other stakeholders is not merely a 


choice, but has become absolutely necessary to achieve the required targets and results. Problems and 
threats in cyberspace cannot be fully mitigated by a single country alone, and as such, constructive 
cooperation between states on the European level is required. 

The Republic of Cyprus, through the activities of OCECPR and of the other competent authorities, is 
already represented to a high degree at most relevant working groups and international fora which 
operate under the auspices of the European Commission and of ENISA. The continued representation of 
the Republic of Cyprus at such fora and working groups is an integral part of this Strategy, with the 
target of active participation and contribution of Cyprus to significant decisions that are made via the 
work of these groups. Close ties will be created with respective competent authorities in other member 
states of the European Union, and these ties will be leveraged for the continuous development and 
improvement of the strategic response capabilities of the Republic of Cyprus in cybersecurity. 

Full support of actions and activities, that aim to improve the cybersecurity levels of European 
information infrastructures, as well as participation in other international activities and related 
groups7, will also be continued. 

7 E.g. IMPACT (International Multilateral Partnership Against Cyber Threats). 

It is noted that the element of confidentiality must be taken into account during all cooperation and 
exchange of information and experiences with international organisations and working groups, as 
described in section 3.3 regarding the formation of the working groups. 

Action 15 - Phase A – The Republic of Cyprus will continue to build upon its constructive 
cooperation with the rest of the European Union member states, through its representation 
and active contributions to relevant working groups and fora. This cooperation will support the 
actions and activities on a Union level to improve the level of cybersecurity in the whole of 
Europe. 




3.14 Development of a National Contingency Plan for Critical 
Information Infrastructures 

The measures and actions that have been discussed in preceding sections will contribute, to a large 
extent, to the improvement of cybersecurity in the Republic of Cyprus, including both the public and 
private sectors. The implementation of all of the actions in an organised and effective way will help 
reach the target of a safer and more secure information society. 

However, no technological system or set of measures and actions, regardless of how comprehensive 
they are, will be able to protect cyberspace to an absolute degree, especially the critical information 
infrastructures of any country. Bearing this in mind, it is essential to develop a National Contingency 
Plan for Critical Information Infrastructures. The target of this plan will be to guide and develop detailed 


processes and measures that will be taken when a large scale crisis affects the operations of critical 
information infrastructures (as will be defined and identified in the relevant action described in section 
3.6) in the Republic of Cyprus to a significant degree. 

The creation and development of the National Contingency Plan will be performed in tandem with the 
identification of critical information infrastructures in the Republic of Cyprus, and will include the 
following activities: 

. Designation of categories and hierarchies of critical infrastructures, based on their contribution 
to the operation of vital communications and information services, 
. Designation of the level of protection required for each part of this infrastructure (e.g. 
redundancy, alternative routes, physical security, etc.) to minimise the effects of its potential 
damage or destruction, 
. Development of early warning systems and processes to monitor critical infrastructures, 
potentially with the help of the CERTs, 
. Creation of (or improvement of already existing) emergency communications networks which 
are independent from the main networks, and if possible, using alternative means of 
communication entirely (e.g. wired, mobile and satellite networks), 
. Development of comprehensive communications and management processes, between critical 
information infrastructure operators, for the handling of a potential crisis and to achieve 
constructive collaboration between them, 
. Organisation of regular national cyber exercises with realistic crisis scenarios (see section 3.10) 
to test and improve the processes developed above, 
. Identification of all the critical information infrastructures that are connected to other countries, 
or which provide services that could affect information infrastructures in other countries, 
. Identification of available resources in terms of equipment and infrastructure, where deemed 
useful or necessary, between the relevant departments and services, and the creation of 
synergies for covering each other’s resources and services in emergencies. 


ENISA has prepared a comprehensive document8 which describes best practices for the development of 
National Contingency Plans for critical information infrastructures, and which will be taken into account 
for the development of the related plan for the Republic of Cyprus; it emphasises the importance of a 
comprehensive cybersecurity and protection of critical information infrastructures strategy as a basis. It 
is noted that these above provisions, where needed, will be leveraged for the contribution of Cyprus to 
the development of a wider European Contingency Plan for the protection of European critical 
information infrastructures, whose abnormal operation would have negative impact in more than one 
member state. 

8ENISA Good Practice Guide on National Contingency Plans for Critical Information Infrastructure 


Action 16 - Phase A – Development of a National Contingency Plan, which will contain detailed 
processes and measures that will be taken when a large scale crisis affects the operations of 
critical information infrastructures in the Republic of Cyprus to a significant degree, with the 
aim of maintaining their operation at an acceptable minimum level until full restoration. 




3.15 Interdependencies 

This Strategy places special emphasis on the interdependencies and interactions between the actions 
that are described, even though each one has its own specific and separate targets, for its successful 
completion. The strategic response to threats against network and information security must be 
approached in a holistic fashion and it needs to be understood that many of these actions have to be 
implemented in combination, with the target of maximal success of such a strategic response. 

Interdependencies are also evident in other levels of this response. As can be seen in section 2.3, there 
are a number of competent authorities handling different aspects of security, each one with its own 
areas of responsibility. Despite the fact that duplication needs to be avoided, all interdependencies 
must be recognised and the cooperation between these authorities must be ensured so that the 
specialised knowledge and capabilities within each authority can be leveraged to maximum effect. 
These interdependencies are large in number, and so it is necessary to identify and study them, as well 
as incorporate them into any future actions or response plans that may be developed. 

In addition to this, operators of critical information infrastructures must explore, as part of their 
activities to manage threats and risks and for the development of business continuity plans, the 
interdependencies that they have for the secure management of their infrastructures, at all levels. In 
other words, the following questions needs to be answered: 

. On whom does the business depend in relation to security? 
. Who depends on the business in relation to security? 


It is noted that an initial depiction of the interdependencies between the actions described in this 
document can be found in Appendix II. 

Action 17 - Phase A/B – Identification and study of the interdependencies that exist for the 
implementation of this Strategy. These interdependencies will initially be identified as existing 
in the relationships between the actions themselves, the relationships between the competent 
authorities of the State, and the relationships between the critical infrastructure operators with 
their suppliers, customers and staff. These interdependencies must be recognised and accepted 
by all relevant stakeholders. 




 


4. NEXT STEPS 

4.1 Immediate Actions – Phase A 

It has been deemed necessary that a number of the actions, that have been identified and described in 
this document, need to start immediately, independently of the implementation of the remaining 
provisions of the strategic response. Taking into account the activities that are prioritised in section 3.2, 
and their associated actions described herein, the following activities must begin in 2012: the 
identification of critical information infrastructures (section 3.6), the development of a National 
Contingency Plan for these infrastructures (section 3.14), ensuring the full operation of Computer 
Emergency Response Teams for incidents related to network and information security (CSIRT/CERT) and 
the planning and participation of Cyprus in the pan-European exercise Cyber Europe 2012 (section 3.10). 

Specifically, the actions to be performed within Phase A are as follows: 

. Action 1 – Collaboration Framework 
. Action 2 - Organisational Structure 
. Action 3 (partial implementation) – Creating of Working Groups 
. Action 5 (partial implementation) – Survey of the Private Sector 
. Action 7 - Identification of Critical Information Infrastructures 
. Action 10 – Ensuring the Full Operation of the CERTs 
. Action 12 – National and International Exercises 
. Action 15 – International Cooperation 
. Action 16 - Development of a National Contingency Plan for Critical Information Infrastructures 
. Action 17 – (partial implementation) Modelling and Analysis of Interdependencies. 


This document provides synopses of the most important actions that have been identified for a 
coherent strategic response, so that cyberspace (and more generally the networks and information that 
are used on a daily basis) is secured, across the whole of Cypriot society. However, for correct 
implementation, each action needs to be analysed and expanded in detail, so that all associated 
activities can be identified. A detailed analysis of each of the actions in the strategic response will 
follow, as well as the identification of the resources and processes that will be needed for the 
implementation. 

4.2 Cost of Implementation 

In the context of detailed assessment and analysis of the individual actions, to the point to which it is 
feasible, the cost of implementing each action, as well as the time periods where specific budget items 
will be required, will be identified. This costing process will be undertaken in cooperation with the 
competent authorities, and always bearing in mind the importance of each action and range of its 
application, so that the costing can be as realistic as possible. 


In parallel with this costing, the actions described in this document will be prioritised (independently of 
their estimated cost), as to their importance and criticality in relation to the results that they are 
expected to provide towards a safer electronic environment in the Republic of Cyprus. It is noted that 
this activity will be undertaken independently of the costing process for the actions that is described

4.3 Planning of Actions 2012 - 2015 

The activities mentioned in sections 4.1 and 4.2 are important so that the correct planning of the 
strategic response actions can move forward, based on the resources that the State will make available 
for the implementation of this Strategy. This planning will be undertaken based on the results of the 
detailed assessment, costing and prioritisation of the actions, so that the implementation of the 
Strategic Response as a whole can be achieved in the best and most effective way possible, given 
available resources. The result of this process will be a detailed timeline which will allow the monitoring 
of the implementation status of all of the current Strategy’s actions. 

4.4 Results Assessment and Strategy Review 

To achieve an effective strategic response, its implementation progress must be regularly and strictly 
reviewed. Towards this end, the results of the implementation of the measures and provisions included 
in the strategy actions will be analysed quantitatively and qualitatively accordingly. A proper 
cybersecurity strategy cannot be considered to be a ‘final plan’; on the contrary, its implementation 
must be observed and updated at regular intervals. This review process needs to take into 
consideration the assessment results, as well as new threats that appear (and will continue to appear) in 
cyberspace and any other new conditions that manifest in this area. 

The detailed expansion of the strategy actions, as described in section 4.1, will include indicators and 
criteria for assessing the performance of each action, where feasible, and the results of this assessment 
will allow the proper review of the Strategy in the future, with substantial benefits to Cypriot society. 

 


APPENDIX I - OVERVIEW OF STRATEGY ACTIONS 

 

. Phase A 
o Phase A includes all of the actions that OCECPR is in a position to start in the immediate 
future with the resources that are currently available to it. 


. Phase B 
o Phase B includes the actions that OCECPR will be in a position to coordinate once a new 
organisational structure has been developed, with the necessary resources to carry out 
the implementation of this Strategy in its entirety. 




 
Action 1 - Phase A – Formulation of the framework for collaboration and information exchange with OCECPR, 
and between public authorities, so that OCECPR will be in a position to effectively coordinate the nation’s 
strategic response in the area of cybersecurity and the protection of critical information infrastructures, as well 
as coordinating the actions that relate to other stakeholders in the priority areas that can be addressed 
immediately. ....................................................................................................................................................... 17 
Action 2 - Phase A – OCECPR will, at the appropriate time and in cooperation with the other competent 
authorities, develop a report regarding new policy for its reorganisation, so that it will be in a position to fully 
coordinate the efforts of the Republic of Cyprus for optimum implementation, application and supervision of all 
of the actions and the effective response to threats that are prevalent in cyberspace today, as well as rising 
threats that will appear in the future. .................................................................................................................. 17 
Action 3 - Phase A/B – Formation of working groups, with representatives from the public and private sectors (as 
necessary), to implement the Strategy Actions. ................................................................................................... 18 
Action 4 - Phase B – Creation of an appropriate legal framework to fully support the provisions of the 
Cybersecurity Strategy. All relevant laws of the competent authorities must be assessed for any updated needs. 
............................................................................................................................................................................ 18 
Action 5 - Phase A/B – Comprehensive survey of the private sector, for the identification of groups and 
stakeholders that can contribute in a positive way to the improvement of the levels of electronic security in the 
Republic of Cyprus, while simultaneously creating the conditions for developing close collaborative 
relationships. ....................................................................................................................................................... 19 
Action 6 - Phase B – Investigate the possibility of creating a dynamic PPP (Public-Private Partnership) in the area 
of critical information infrastructure protection in the Republic of Cyprus and promote active cooperation with 
international entities through participation in international fora. The use of the PPP to foster trust between the 
State and private sector will be of primary importance. ...................................................................................... 20 
Action 7 - Phase A – Identification and assessment of the critical information infrastructures in the republic of 
Cyprus, to better target activities and actions for their protection, with the contribution of both the public and 
private sectors. .................................................................................................................................................... 21 
 Action 8 - Phase B – Comprehensive survey to record current threats and attacks in cyberspace that have been 
published in Cyprus, as well as monitoring new threats that appear in the European and international space. .. 21 
Action 9 - Phase B – Development of a National Cybersecurity Framework which will promote the protection of 
critical information infrastructures in the Republic of Cyprus, as well as governmental departments and services. 
............................................................................................................................................................................ 22 
Action 10 - Phase A – Ensure the full functionality of Computer Emergency Response Teams (CERTs/CSIRTs), with 
immediate priority for the operation of the Governments CERT/CSIRT. Necessary certifications and 
memberships will be obtained to allow their participation in relevant European working groups. ..................... 23 
Action 11 - Phase B – Assessment by OCECPR, in cooperation with the CERTs/CSIRTs, of expanding their activities 
or creating new CERTs/CSIRTs to cover the needs of the private sector and the business community................. 23 
Action 12 - Phase A – Planning and organisation of regular national cybersecurity exercises, with increasingly 
realistic scenarios, as well as active participation in pan-European and other international cyber exercises. ...... 24 
Action 13 - Phase B – Development of suitable human resources that will have the necessary technical know-
how and certifications to implement the provisions of this Strategy to a high level, in the mid- and long-term, 
and inclusion of these skills and certifications into the job descriptions for related positions. ............................ 24 
Action 14 - Phase B – Development of a comprehensive National Awareness Programme for cybersecurity 
matters, covering all users of electronic systems, from governmental workers to citizens of the State. .............. 25 
Action 15 - Phase A – The Republic of Cyprus will continue to build upon its constructive cooperation with the 
rest of the European Union member states, through its representation and active contributions to relevant 
working groups and fora. This cooperation will support the actions and activities on a Union level to improve 
the level of cybersecurity in the whole of Europe. ............................................................................................... 26 
Action 16 - Phase A – Development of a National Contingency Plan, which will contain detailed processes and 
measures that will be taken when a large scale crisis affects the operations of critical information infrastructures 
in the Republic of Cyprus to a significant degree, with the aim of maintaining their operation at an acceptable 
minimum level until full restoration. ................................................................................................................... 28 
Action 17 - Phase A/B – Identification and study of the interdependencies that exist for the implementation of 
this Strategy. These interdependencies will initially be identified as existing in the relationships between the 
actions themselves, the relationships between the competent authorities of the State, and the relationships 
between the critical infrastructure operators with their suppliers, customers and staff. These interdependencies 
must be recognised and accepted by all relevant stakeholders. .......................................................................... 28
