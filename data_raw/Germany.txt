Introduction
Cyberspace includes all information infrastructures accessible via the Internet
beyond all territorial boundaries. In Germany all players of social and economic
life use the possibilities provided by cyberspace. As part of an increasingly interconnected world, the state, critical infrastructures, businesses and citizens in
Germany depend on the reliable functioning of information and communication
technology and the Internet.

Malfunctioning IT products and components, the break-down of information
infrastructures or serious cyber attacks may have a considerable negative impact on
the performance of technology, businesses and the administration and hence on
Germany’s social lifelines. The availability of cyberspace and the integrity, authenticity and confidentiality of data in cyberspace have become vital questions of the
21st century. Ensuring cyber security has thus turned into a central challenge for
the state, business and society both at national and international level. The Cyber
Security Strategy is intended to improve the framework conditions in this area.

IT threat assessment
In recent years attacks against information infrastructures have become ever
more frequent and complex, while at the same time perpetrators have become
more professional. Cyber attacks are launched both from Germany and abroad.
Given the openness and extent of cyberspace it is possible to conduct covert attacks
and misuse vulnerable systems as tools for an attack. In view of technologically
sophisticated malware the possibilities of responding to and retracing an attack
are rather limited. Often attacks give no clue as to the identity and the background
of the attacker. Criminals, terrorists and spies use cyberspace as a place for their
activities and do not stop at state borders. Military operations can also be behind
such attacks.

The trend to develop information systems for industry on the basis of standard
components and connect them to cyberspace, which is motivated mainly by
economic concerns, entails new vulnerabilities. Experience with the Stuxnet virus
shows that important industrial infrastructures are no longer exempted from
targeted IT attacks.

Given the increasing complexity and vulnerability of information infrastructures
the cyber security situation will remain critical also in the future. In Germany, the
public and the private sector as well as society at large are all equally affected by
targeted or coincidental IT failures.

3

Framework conditions
Ensuring cyber security, enforcing rights and protecting critical information
infrastructures require major efforts by the state both at national level and in
cooperation with international partners. Given the shared responsibilities of the
state, the industry and the society a cyber security strategy will only be successful
if all players act as partners and fulfil their tasks together. The same applies to the
international context.

Since IT systems are interconnected in global networks, incidents in other countries’ information infrastructures may also indirectly affect Germany. For this reason, strengthening cyber security also requires the enforcement of international
rules of conduct, standards and norms. Only a mix of domestic and external policy
measures will be appropriate for the dimension of the problem. Cyber security
can be improved by enhancing the framework conditions for drawing up common minimum standards (code of conduct) with allies and partners. Fighting the
rapid growth of cybercrime requires close cooperation between law enforcement
authorities worldwide.

Basic principles of the
Cyber Security Strategy
The Federal Government aims at making a substantial contribution to a secure
cyberspace, thus maintaining and promoting economic and social prosperity in
Germany. Cyber security in Germany must be ensured at a level commensurate
with the importance and protection required by interlinked information infrastructures, without hampering the opportunities and the utilization of the cyberspace. In this context the level of cyber security reached is the sum of all national
and international measures taken to protect the availability of information and
communications technology and the integrity, authenticity and confidentiality
of data in cyberspace.

4

Cyber security must be based on a comprehensive approach. This requires even
more intensive information sharing and coordination. The Cyber Security Strategy mainly focuses on civilian approaches and measures. They are complemented
by measures taken by the Bundeswehr 1 to protect its capabilities and measures
based on mandates to make cyber security a part of Germany’s preventive security
strategy. Given the global nature of information and communications technology,
international coordination and appropriate networks focusing on foreign and
security policy aspects are indispensable. This includes cooperation not only in the
United Nations, but also in the EU, the Council of Europe, NATO, the G8, the OSCE
and other multinational organizations. The aim is to ensure the coherence and
capabilities of the international community to protect cyberspace.

Strategic objectives
and measures
With the present Cyber Security Strategy the Federal Government adapts measures to the current threats on the basis of the structures established by the CIP
implementation plan and the implementation plan for the federal administration.
The Federal Government will specifically focus on ten strategic areas:

1. Protection of critical information infrastructures
The protection of critical information infrastructures is the main priority of
cyber security. They are a central component of nearly all critical infrastructures
and become increasingly important. The public and the private sector must create an enhanced strategic and organizational basis for closer coordination based
on intensified information sharing. To this end, cooperation established by the
CIP implementation plan is systematically extended, and legal commitments to

6

enhance the binding nature of the CIP implementation plan are examined. With
the participation of the National Cyber Security Council (cf. objective 5), the integration of additional sectors is examined and the introduction of new relevant
technologies is considered to a greater extent. Whether and where protective
measures have to be made mandatory and whether and where additional powers
are required in case of specific threats have to be clarified, too. Furthermore we will
examine the necessity of harmonizing rules to maintain critical infrastructures
during IT crises.

2. Secure IT systems in Germany
Infrastructure protection requires more security with regard to IT systems used
by citizens and small and medium-sized businesses. Users need appropriate and
consistent information on risks related to the use of IT systems and on security
measures they can take to use cyberspace in a secure manner. We will organize
joint initiatives with groups from society to pool information and advice consistently. Furthermore we will examine whether providers may have to assume
greater responsibility and make sure that a basic collection of appropriate security
products and services are made available to users by providers. We want to provide
specific incentives and funds for basic security functions certified by the state (e. g.
electronic proof of identity or De-mail) to be used by the vast majority of citizens.

To support small and medium-sized businesses in the secure use of IT systems,
the Federal Ministry of Economics and Technology has set up a task force on
“IT security in industry” with the participation of industry.

3. Strengthening IT security in the public administration
The public administration will further enhance the protection of its IT systems.
State authorities have to serve as role models for data security. We will create a
common, uniform and secure network infrastructure in the federal administration (“federal networks”) as a basis for electronic audio and data communication.
We will continue to press ahead with the implementation plan for the federal
administration. Should the IT security situation get worse, this plan may be
7

aligned accordingly. Effective IT security requires powerful structures in all
federal authorities. For this reason resources must be deployed appropriately at
central and local level. To facilitate implementation through uniform action
by authorities, joint investments into the Federal Government’s IT security will
be made regularly in line with budgetary possibilities. Operational cooperation
with the federal Länder, particularly with regard to CERTs (computer emergency
response teams), will be further intensified by the IT planning council.

4. National Cyber Response Centre
To optimize operational cooperation between all state authorities and improve
the coordination of protection and response measures for IT incidents we will
set up a National Cyber Response Centre. It will report to the Federal Office for
Information Security (BSI) and cooperate directly with the Federal Office for the
Protection of the Constitution (BfV) and the Federal Office of Civil Protection and
Disaster Assistance (BBK). Cooperation in the National Cyber Response Centre
will strictly observe the statutory tasks and powers of all authorities involved on
the basis of cooperation agreements. The Federal Criminal Police Office (BKA),
the Federal Police (BPOL), the Customs Criminological Office (ZKA), the Federal
Intelligence Service (BND), the Bundeswehr and authorities supervising critical
infrastructure operators all participate in this centre within the framework of
their statutory tasks and powers.

Quick and close information sharing on weaknesses of IT products, vulnerabilities,
forms of attacks and profiles of perpetrators enables the National Cyber Response
Centre to analyse IT incidents and give consolidated recommendations for action.
The interests of the private sector to protect itself against crime and espionage in
cyberspace should also be adequately taken into account. At the same time
respective responsibilities must be observed. Every stakeholder takes the necessary
measures in its remit on the basis of the jointly developed national cyber security
assessment and coordinates them with the competent authorities as well as
partners from industry and academia.

Since security preparedness is best achieved by early warning and prevention, the
Cyber Response Centre will submit recommendations to the National Cyber Security Council both on a regular basis and for specific incidents. If the cyber security
situation reaches the level of an imminent or already occurred crisis, the National
Cyber Response Centre will directly inform the crisis management staff headed by
the responsible State Secretary at the Federal Ministry of the Interior.

8

5. National Cyber Security Council
The identification and removal of structural causes for crises are considered an
important preventive tool for cyber security. For this reason we want to establish
and maintain cooperation within the Federal Government and between the public
and the private sector within the responsibility of the Federal Government Commissioner for Information Technology more visible and set up a National Cyber
Security Council. The Federal Chancellery and a State Secretary from each the
Federal Foreign Office, the Federal Ministry of the Interior, the Federal Ministry of
Defence, the Federal Ministry for Economics and Technology, the Federal Ministry
of Justice, the Federal Ministry of Finance, the Federal Ministry of Education and
Resarch and representatives of the federal Länder will participate. On specific
occasions additional ministries will be included.

Business representatives will be invited as associated members. Representatives
from academia will be involved, if required. The National Cyber Security Council is
intended to coordinate preventive tools and the interdisciplinary cyber security

9

approaches of the public and the private sector. The National Cyber Security Council
will complement and interlink IT management at federal level and the work of the IT
Planning Council in the area of cyber security at a political and strategic level.

6. Effective crime control also in cyberspace
The capabilities of law enforcement agencies, the Federal Office for Information
Security and the private sector in combating cyber crime, also with regard to
protection against espionage and sabotage, must be strengthened. To improve the
exchange of know how in this area we intend to set up joint institutions with industry with the participation of the competent law enforcement agencies, which will
act in an advisory capacity. Projects to support partner countries with structural
weaknesses will also serve the aim of combating cyber crime. To face up to the
growing challenges of global cyber crime activities we will make a major effort to
achieve global harmonization in criminal law based on the Council of Europe
Cyber Crime Convention. Furthermore, we will examine whether additional
conventions in this area may be necessary at UN level.

10

7. Effective coordinated action to ensure cyber security in Europe
and worldwide
In global cyberspace security can be achieved only through coordinated tools at
national and international level.

At EU level we support appropriate measures based on the action plan for the
protection of critical information infrastructures, the extension and moderate
enlargement of the mandate of the European Network and Information Security
Agency (ENISA) in view of the changed threat situation in ICT and the pooling
of IT competences in EU institutions. The EU Internal Security Strategy and the
Digital Agenda provide guidance for further activities.

We will shape our external cyber policy in such a way that German interests and
ideas concerning cyber security are coordinated and pursued in international
organizations, such as the United Nations, the OSCE, the Council of Europe, the
OECD and NATO. An increasingly multilateral approach must be brought in line
with the necessity of sovereign evaluation and decision-making powers. In this
context, a code for state conduct in cyberspace (cyber code) should be established, which is signed by as many countries as possible and includes confidencebuilding security measures. In the G8 framework we are currently working on
intensifying anti-botnet activities.

NATO serves as the basis of transatlantic security. Hence, NATO must take cyber
security appropriately into account in its entire range of responsibilities. We are
in favour of the alliance’s commitment to establishing uniform security standards, which Member States may also use for civilian critical infrastructures on a
voluntary basis, as foreseen in NATO’s new Strategic Concept.

8. Use of reliable and trustworthy information technology
The availability of reliable IT systems and components must be ensured on a
permanent basis. The development of innovative protection plans for improved
security which take into account social and economic aspects is strongly supported. To this end, we will continue and intensify research on IT security and
on critical infrastructure protection. Furthermore we will strengthen Germany’s
technological sovereignty and economic capacity in the entire range of core
strategic IT competences, include them in our political strategies and develop
them further. Wherever it makes sense, we will pool our resources with those

11

of our partners and allies, particularly in Europe. We are in favour of diversity
in technology. Our aim is to use components in critical security areas which are
certified against an international recognized certification standard.

9. Personnel development in federal authorities
Given the strategic importance of cyber security, it must be examined as a priority
whether additional staff is necessary in authorities in the interest of cyber security.
Furthermore, intensified personnel exchange between federal authorities and appropriate further training measures will enhance interministerial cooperation.

10. Tools to respond to cyber attacks
If the state wants to be fully prepared for cyber attacks, a coordinated and comprehensive set of tools to respond to cyber attacks must be created in cooperation with the competent state authorities. We will continue to assess the threat
situation regularly and take appropriate protection measures. If necessary, we
have to examine whether additional statutory powers must be created at federal
or Länder level. Above all, the aims, mechanisms and institutions mentioned
above must be internalized through a permanent exercise process with the
relevant federal and Länder authorities as well as businesses.

12

Sustainable
implementation
With the implementation of the strategic objectives and measures the Federal
Government contributes to ensuring cyber security and thus to freedom and
prosperity in Germany. A lot will depend on whether we succeed at international
level in taking effective measures to protect cyberspace.

The information technologies used are subject to short innovation cycles. This
means that the technical and social aspects of cyberspace will continue to
change and bear not only new opportunities, but also new risks. For this reason
the Federal Government will regularly review whether the aims of the Cyber
Security Strategy have been achieved under the overall control of the National
Cyber Security Council and will adapt the strategies and measures to the given
requirements and framework conditions.

(Explanations and terminology used in this document)

Cyberspace
Cyberspace is the virtual space of all IT systems linked at data level on a global scale.
The basis for cyberspace is the Internet as a universal and publicly accessible connection and transport network which can be complemented and further expanded by
any number of additional data networks. IT systems in an isolated virtual space are
not part of cyberspace.

Cyber attack, cyber espionage and cyber sabotage
A cyber attack is an IT attack in cyberspace directed against one or several other
IT systems and aimed at damaging IT security. The aims of IT security, confidentiality, integrity and availability may all or individually be compromised. Cyber
attacks directed against the confidentiality of an IT system, which are launched

14

or managed by foreign intelligence services, are called cyber espionage. Cyber
attacks against the integrity and availability of IT systems are termed cyber
sabotage.

Cyber security and civilian and military cyber security
(Global) cyber security is the desired objective of the IT security situation,
in which the risks of global cyberspace have been reduced to an acceptable
minimum.

Hence, cyber security in Germany is the desired objective of the IT security
situation, in which the risks of the German cyberspace have been reduced to an
acceptable minimum. Cyber security (in Germany) is the sum of suitable and
appropriate measures.

Civilian cyber security focuses on all IT systems for civilian use in German cyberspace. Military cyber security focuses on all IT systems for military use in German
cyberspace.

Critical infrastructures
Critical infrastructures are organizations or institutions with major importance
for the public good, whose failure or damage would lead to sustainable supply
bottlenecks, considerable disturbance of public security or other dramatic
consequences.

At federal level, the following areas have been identified:

•

Energy

•

Information technology and telecommunication

•

Transport

•

Health

•

Water

•

Food

•

Finance and insurance sector

•

State and administration

•
