Republic of Mauritius - National Cyber Security Strategy

1. INTRODUCTION
Societies are becoming increasingly more dependent on information and communication
technologies which are globally interconnected. With these growing dependencies, information
systems and networks are extremely vulnerable to disturbances which can affect their
functioning. Cyber-security threats have become more sophisticated and have more serious
repercussions than before. There is a growing misuse of electronic networks for criminal
purposes or for objectives that can adversely affect the integrity of a nation’s critical
infrastructures. Cyber-attacks can be mounted at any time, against anyone and from anywhere. In
a realm, where technology and change are speeding, responding effectively to cyber threats
require a consistent and extensive effort. To address the cyber security issues in Mauritius, a
National Cyber Security Strategy is required which will define the main goals, guidelines and
action plans to respond effectively to cyber threats. The strategy also recognizes the fundamental
challenge of balancing the measures intended to protect security.
By following the strategic guidelines and measures, Mauritius will be able to manage deliberate
and unintentional disturbances in the cyber space as well as respond to and recover from them.
The aspiration is that the action plans outlined in this strategy will position Mauritius where
citizens know what to do to protect them; law enforcement is tackling cyber criminals; effective
cyber security is seen as positive for business in Mauritius; online public services are secure and
the threats to our national infrastructure and national security have been confronted.
The strategy provides an overview of what it takes to effectively protect information systems and
networks and also gives an insight into the Government’s approach and strategy for protection of
cyberspace in the country. The cybersecurity strategic programmes which were set out in both
NICTSP 2007-2011 and NICTSP 2011-2014 have been taken into account to build the
cybersecurity strategic plan. The inputs have also been taken from the survey conducted on the
State of Information Security in Businesses in Mauritius completed in October 2013. The
purpose of the survey was to assess the security posture of businesses in Mauritius.
The cyber security policy is an evolving task and it caters to the whole spectrum of ICT users
including home users and small, medium and large enterprises and Government & nonGovernment entities. It serves as an umbrella framework for defining and guiding the actions
related to the security of cyberspace. It also enables individual sectors and organisations in
designing appropriate cyber security policies to suit their needs.

Cyber Security Management And The Mauritian Approach

7|Page

Republic of Mauritius - National Cyber Security Strategy

3. CYBER SECURITY MANAGEMENT AND THE MAURITIAN APPROACH
Preparing for cyber threats and cyber defense involve immediate, transparent and better
coordinated action from all parties in society, both individually and collectively. It is important
to provide political guidance and strategic guidelines for cyber security and take necessary
decisions regarding the allocation of resources and prerequisites.
Cyber Security management requires that the different stakeholders have a reliable, real-time
cyber security situation depiction of the condition of society’s key functions and the disturbances
which can affect their functions. The natures of threats highlight the importance of cooperation
as well as efficient and flexible coordination.
National cyber resilience will be tailored to ensure the preparedness and predictive capabilities
required by the goals and to facilitate its operating capability during cyber conflicts and postconflict recovery.

3.1 Principles
The Mauritian approach for managing cyber security is built on the following principles:
1. Cyber security is a significant part of the comprehensive security of society. The
approach for the implementation of the national cyber strategic plan is based on the set of
goals for cyber security.
2. Cyber Security relies on the information security preparedness of the whole nation. The
implementation of a CIIP framework will help in protecting the national critical
information infrastructures. This will also include developing and offering expertise and
advice, support and implement responses to threats or incidents and strengthen crisis
management.
3. The methodology for the implementation of national cyber strategic action plan is
established on efficient and comprehensive collection of information, an analysis and
gathering system along with common and shared situation awareness, national and
international cooperation in preparedness. This requires the establishment of an AntiCyber Threat Monitoring System which will aid to better respond, monitor and
coordinate cyber threats at national level by operating on a 24/7 basis.
4. Cyber security is being constructed to meet its functional and technical requirements. A
comprehensive framework will be set up to monitor Internet traffic which might be
harmful to the nation and society.

Republic of Mauritius - National Cyber Security Strategy

5. In order to ensure cyber security development, Mauritius will see to it that appropriate
legislations and incentives exist to support the business activities and their development
in this field.

3.2 Proposed Governance Structure

To enable a collaborative working of all key players in public and private sector to safeguard the
country’s information infrastructure, a partnership of government, corporate and private
stakeholders is important and will lead to the success of the implementation of the strategy. An
effective public-private partnership for cyber security would provide the abilities to identify
threats, anomalous behaviours, respond to them and will create a more secure network
environment through better standardized security programs. This partnership will also set a stage
to carry out research and development and find ways to mitigate security threats. Finally, this
will also help to empower stakeholders to properly address cyber threats.

Strategic Guidelines For Cyber Security
Importance Of The National Cyber Security Strategy And Action Plan

13 | P a g e

Republic of Mauritius - National Cyber Security Strategy

4. STRATEGIC GUIDELINES FOR CYBER SECURITY
A national cyber security strategy is established in line with the strategic guidelines. This will
create the conditions for the realization of the national cyber security vision. A separately
prepared action plan will outline the measures to achieve the national cyber security goals. The
implementation of the strategic guidelines will reinforce national and international cooperation.
Such collaboration can best serve the whole society and support the stakeholders who play a
significant role in the cyber security community. Cyber security is constructed on capabilities
development over the long term, their convenience and flexible use and the resilience of
society’s key functions against the disturbances in cyber security.

Strategic Guidelines
Guidelines

a

To secure our Cyberspace and establish a front line of defense against Cybercrime
This initiative is aimed at building an approach to cyber defense strategy that prevents
interference and attack in cyberspace by improving capabilities, articulating roles and
developing appropriate responses for public and private sector. By creating or enhancing shared
situational awareness of network vulnerabilities, threats and events and the ability to act quickly
to reduce our current vulnerabilities and prevent intrusions can help in securing our cyberspace.
Additionally, this strategic guideline also emphasizes on enhancing the capacity of law
enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute cybercrime. Cyber defense against
cybercrime will be exercised and developed together through international cooperation and the
exchange of information.

b

To enhance our resilience to Cyber Attacks and be able to defend against the full spectrum
of threats
The strategic guidelines of the National Cyber Security Strategy are advanced by intensifying
efforts to protect the critical infrastructure and networks in order to provide reasonable assurance
of resilience and security to support national missions and economic stability. The well-being of
the national economy, security and quality of life is becoming increasingly dependent on the
safety and the robustness of critical infrastructures whose disruptions can affect a nation’s ability
to function effectively in crisis. Key importance is being given to government information
infrastructure & systems which will be protected against cyber threats through security audits
and implementation of national and international Information Security standards. The goal is to
detect and identify any disturbances to the vital functions and to respond to them in a manner
which minimizes their detrimental effects.

14 | P a g e

Republic of Mauritius - National Cyber Security Strategy

c

To develop an efficient collaborative model between the authorities and the business
community for the purpose of advancing National Cyber Security and Cyber Defense
The strategic guidelines of the Cyber Security Strategy are reinforced by strengthening active
collaboration between actors whose aim is to achieve a shared situation awareness and effective
defense against the cyber threats. A common set of criteria will be created to facilitate
identification of critical IT infrastructures and systems. A method will be devised for risk and
vulnerability assessments. Cyber defense will be advanced by promoting the exchange of
information and regulations as well as through cooperation between the authorities and the
business community.

d

To improve the Cyber Expertise and the comprehensive Cyber Security Awareness of all
societal actors
Encouraging a cadre of cyber security professionals and building capacity to deter and
defend against high-end threats
In a secure information society, everyone must be aware of the information security risks of their
actions and their responsibility in preventing those risks. This strategy is intended to raise the
level of competence by investing in the expertise of information security professionals and in the
general awareness of information security of all actors. To continuously improve the competence
and awareness of the actors, inputs will be made to promote the development of a cadre of
skilled cyber security professionals and capacity building so that Mauritius can retain an edge in
this area and development to keep producing innovative solutions operations in cyberspace.
By promoting awareness of the need for cyber security, the Strategy will encourage individuals,
Industry and all levels of government to adapt behaviour and adopt the technology required to
confront evolving cyber threats.
The cooperation between industry and academia on knowledge sharing in information security
areas will also be promoted by holding regular annual conferences on information security
targeting major players and participants in the region.

5. IMPORTANCE OF THE NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY
AND ACTION PLAN
The ICT sector is influencing the lives of people through direct or indirect contribution to the
various socio-economic parameters such as employment and standard of living. It is playing a
significant role in transforming Mauritius into a cyber-hub in the African region. The
Government has also been a key driver for increased adoption and promotion of IT based
15 | P a g e

Republic of Mauritius - National Cyber Security Strategy

products and IT enabled services in the public services (e-Government services to citizens),
education (e-learning, virtual classrooms) and financial services (mobile banking, Internet
banking). Such initiatives have enabled increased IT adoption in the country.
In the light of the growth of the ICT sector in Mauritius, providing the right focus for creating a
secure computing environment has become one of the compelling priorities for the country.
Cyber space is vulnerable to a wide variety of incidents which could hamper economic, public
health, safety and national security activities. Reputation, trust and brand value can all be
seriously affected by information loss and theft.
However, with rapid identification, information exchange, investigation and coordinated
response and remediation, the damaged caused by malicious activities can be mitigated. The
protection of information infrastructure and preservation of the confidentiality, integrity and
availability of information is the essence of a secure cyberspace.
Due to the dynamic nature of the cyberspace, there is a need to address the security challenges
and issues. These actions are unified under a National Cyber Security Strategy which sets out
guidelines, measures and action plans that will provide reasonable assurance of resilience and
security to support national missions and economic stability. A secure society makes it easier for
both individuals and businesses to plan their activities, which in turn boosts economic activity as
well as improve the country’s appeal for international investors. The implementation of the
strategy is planned over a period of 5 years from 2014 to 2019.
