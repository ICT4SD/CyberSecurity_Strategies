National ICT Strategy 
2012-2017 

Towards a Digital Society 
and Knowledge-based Economy 


Message from the Minister 
The world is witnessing a revolution in information 
and communications technology (ICT) the scope 
of which stretches far beyond the realm of the 
sector itself. No country seeking real, sustainable 
development and progress can hope to achieve 
these aims without a strong ICT sector in place 
to drive the necessary change. 
In the midst of this revolution in information 
and communications technology, Egypt witnessed 
a different kind of revolution at the beginning 
of 2011: a peaceful, popular political and social 
revolution. In the 25 January Revolution, 
ICT tools and systems, and the use of social 
networks in particular, played a major role 
in events. This revolution changed not only 
Egypt’s future path but also the way Egyptians 
view ICT tools and systems, which have created 
an important platform for expression of views 
and in public affairs. 
Various factors have contributed to boosting the 
role of the internet in politics. In Egypt, internet 
access has expanded significantly over recent 
years among all sectors of society, particularly 
among youth. Indeed, there has been a clear 
transformation in internet usage patterns across 
the Arab world in recent years, with a marked 
increase in use of the internet as a means and 
arena for political activity. 
The ICT sector, in the next phase, should focus 
on adapting ICTs to find solutions to issues of 
concern to the community. While this process 
has indeed already begun, the sector should 
develop a community vision based on the principle 
that development should occur not only in the 
public service sector but also in the managerial 
approach of the state and its constituent bodies. 
This will allow Egypt to achieve a transformation 
embracing digital citizenship in a technological 
society that in its own way will be as impressive 
and far reaching as the change brought about 
by the 25 January Revolution. 
I am looking forward to supporting the start of a 
new era for the ICT sector in Egypt, building on 
past successes and lessons learnt. I am confident 
that more Egyptians will join the information 
community, working together to establish 
the foundations of a new economy based 
on knowledge and sustainable development. 
There are, of course, numerous factors to 
consider in maximizing the role of the ICT 
sector in development. In this new strategy, we 
have therefore addressed a broad range of actions 
in a framework of collective action, targeting greater 
success and progress for the Egyptian ICT sector 
and for the other sectors of the economy. 
I would like to express my gratitude at being 
offered the opportunity to take over the leadership of 
the Ministry of Communications and Information 
Technology (MCIT) at such a critical stage in 
Egypt’s history. 
I am pleased to present the National ICT Strategy 
for 2012 2017, which results from the vision 
and efforts of an integrated team working in 
collaboration with various actors in the community. 
I am honored to present this document to you 
on behalf of the ministry, and to be part of the 
team responsible for not only supporting the 
future development of the national ICT sector, 
but also for shaping up new Egypt.

Executive Summary 
6 
7 
The Ministry of Communications and Information 
Technology is working to support an Egyptian ICT 
sector that plays an active role in facilitating the 
achievement of political, social and economic 
goals during the current stage of democratic 
transition in Egypt. MCIT, therefore, aims to 
build on Egyptians’ positive view of ICT tools 
and systems, adapting and developing them to 
serve the requirements of a democratic society. 
This will include the development of applications 
that support digital citizenship, opening avenues 
for community participation in social issues, and 
protecting freedoms and social justice 

Vision: 
Towards digital citizenship, and an advanced 
knowledge-based economy and a smooth 
transition to democracy 
Mission: 
To develop a democratic knowledge-based 
society that supports a strong Egyptian 
economy and is based on equitable access 
to information and communications services, 
guaranteeing the digital rights of citizens and 
the development of a national industry based 
on human talent and creativity 
To achieve this mission, four strategic objectives 
have been identified: 
Supporting the democratic transition 


Promoting digital citizenship and information 
society 
Promoting sustainable development 
Strengthening the national economy 
The National ICT Strategy for 2012-2017 focuses 
on a number of quantitative targets related to 
important indicators. With regard to supporting 
the democratic transition and promoting the 
information community and digital citizenship, 
the aims are to raise the number of high-speed 
internet subscribers in Egypt to 13 million by 
2015, to have personal computers in at least 
40% of Egyptian households within five years, 
and to establish a national network of 1,000 
Technology Homes. 

On the development front, targets include 
providing all schools and educational institutions 
with high-speed internet access; promoting the 
use of electronic signature applications in three 
government agencies; raising the volume of 
e-commerce by 20%; increasing the proportion 
of e- banking customers using online or mobile 
banking to 30%; and improving Egypt’s ranking 
in the field of Arabic digital content by increasing 
the number of trusted websites by 8-10 %. 

With regard to strengthening the economy, 
the targets are: to maintain ICT sector growth 
rates of 7-10% over the next five years, while 
increasing the sector’s contribution to national 
income to 5%; to raise revenues generated 
from outsourcing services to $2.5 billion and 
from intellectual property to $1 billion; to 
expand the volume of investment in the ICT 
sector by 20% to LE 55 billion; and to boost 
exports of software and embedded software 
within two years to $500 million. Another 
important factor is employment, with plans to 
increase the number of professionals working 
in outsourcing to 75,000, in IT to 30,000, and 
in innovation and entrepreneurship to 10,000. 
The strategy also includes the expansion of the 
national network of technology parks to 20, and 
the growth of Egypt Post as a primary savings 
facility by a yearly average of about 15%.

Supporting the democratic transition 
Promoting sustainable development 
Strengthening the national economy 
Promoting digital citizenship andinformation society 
With regard to access and coverage for high-
speed internet and mobile services, MCIT aims 
to achieve: 


Geographic coverage for fixed internet 
services for 75% of Egyptian households at 
2 megabits per second (Mbps) by 2015, and 
90% of households at 25 Mbps by 2021. 
Availability of 3G mobile services for 98% 
of the population by 2015, and 4G mobile 
services for 90% of the population by 2021. 
4.5 million households, approximately 22% 
of Egyptian households, subscribing to 
high-speed internet services by 2015, and 
9 million households by 2021. 
8 million subscribers to mobile internet 
services by 2015 and 14 million subscribers 
by 2021. 
50% of government agencies connected to 
the internet at 25 Mbps and at least one 
public access point at 25 Mbps serving 50% 
of localities by 2015, and all government 
agencies connected to the internet at 25 
Mbps and one public access point serving all 
major centers and localities by 2021. 
The strategy also addresses the legislative 
environment required for the coming phase. 

This involves the amendment of a number of 
existing laws: Telecommunications Law No. 10 
of 2003, for example, contains certain articles 
that require amendment in line with Egypt’s 
democratic transition that will promote political 
openness and protect freedom of expression. 

Additionally, a number of new laws and 
regulations will be prepared, drafted and 
activated covering areas including freedom of 
information, cyber security and e-commerce. 
There are also plans to develop labor laws 
related to working at home and part-time 
and temporary employment for university 
students, which will increase the number of 
people working in outsourcing. 

The strategy will be implemented through 
a number of strategic pillars: International 
Cooperation; ICT Innovation and Entrepreneurship; 
ICT Industry Development; Digital Citizenship; 
Human Capacity Building; Government ICT 
Infrastructure and Digital Services; and 
Telecommunications and Postal Service 
Infrastructure. 

The general policies of the strategy cover green 
ICT, Arabic digital content, cloud computing, 
digital identity management, access to 
information, e-commerce, mobile applications 
for development, manufacturing of tablet 
computers for education, open-source software 
and empowering people with disabilities. 

The strategic pillars include specific initiatives: 
The Digital Identity Management Initiative, 
The Educational Reform using ICTs, Cloud 
Computing and Tablet Computer Initiative, The 
Arabic Digital Content Initiative, Back to Africa 
Initiative and ICT for Empowering People with 
Disabilities Initiative (PWDs). In addition to 
the high-speed Internet Initiative which was 
launched in 2011 (eMisr). 

In total, the strategy comprises over 40 programs 
and 120 projects.

Strategy Drafting Methodology 



The Ministry of Communications and Information 
Technology was established in 1999 to develop 
the national ICT sector. Highlights of MCIT’s 
journey so far include the release of the 
National Communications Plan in 2000, the 
Strategy for Building the Information Society 
in 2003, the IT Industry National Development 
Strategy in 2006, and the National Strategy for 
Communications and Information Technology 
in 2007. 

The National ICT Strategy for 2012-2017 is 
another important stage of this process. Yet it 
is also significant as its release comes at the 
beginning of a new era for Egypt. As such, the 
strategy was formulated for implementation 
in an atmosphere of political and economic 
change, to support the country’s transition 
while contributing to the development of the 
communications sector both regionally and 
internationally. As with previous strategies, it 
focuses on integrating ICTs across all sectors 
to serve the national development priorities, 
which include preserving natural resources and 
the environment. 

Primary Considerations 

In the formulation of this strategy, the primary 
considerations were the political and economic 
changes taking place in Egypt, the development 
of the communications sector both regionally and 
internationally, and Egypt’s national development 
priorities, in addition to the achievements and 
challenges of the sector over the last decade. 

Work Methodology 

The methodology followed in the drafting of 
the strategy relied on participation and dialogue 
between MCIT and affiliated entities, in addition 
to community dialogue with government 
entities, the private sector and civil society 
organizations. Work began following the 
formation of a specialized committee by the 
Minister of Communications and Information 
Technology mandated to draft the strategy. 
The committee included representatives from 
various departments of MCIT and its affiliated 
entities. The general framework and main 
features of the strategy were defined and 
reviewed in cooperation with the executive 
committee of the ministry. 

In February 2012, an executive summary 
of the strategy was introduced before the 
People’s Assembly and the Cabinet. In 
addition, dialogues were initiated with the 
wider community, including meetings with 
representatives from the private sector, civil 
society and the media. As ICT impacts on 
performance across all sectors of the economy, 
MCIT held a meeting with representatives from 
all government ministries to ensure their needs 
would be reflected within the new ICT strategy. 

This meeting included a review of efforts 
exerted over the previous 10 years, an overview 
of the features of the National ICT Strategy for 
2012-2017 and discussion of the future plans of 
the various ministries in this context. 

In March 2012, a detailed presentation on 
the ICT sector was held for the Transport 
and Information Committee of the People’s 
Assembly highlighting the progress of the 
sector through successive development 
strategies since 2000 and the features of the 
new strategy. The drafting team incorporated 
relevant input from the attendees into the 
current document. 

Strategy Framework 

The present document is divided into two main 
parts: 

The first part includes the vision, mission, aims 
and policies for the ICT sector from 2012 to 
2017, as well as the most important legislative 
amendments that will be formulated during 
this period. 

The second part introduces the seven main 
pillars of the strategy and their corresponding 
programs, and the six targeted initiatives to be 
implemented through the executive plan of the 
strategy. 

The executive plan of the strategy, including 
all the projects to be implemented through 
the strategic axes and targeted initiatives, is 
presented in a separate document.

17 
The ICT revolution has extended the reach of the 
sector far beyond facilitating communication, 
to the extent that sustainable development in 
all fields now largely relies on the use of ICTs. 

Egypt’s 25 January Revolution, which in early 
2011 set the country on the path of political 
transformation, was itself largely influenced by 
the use of ICTs, in particular social networks. 
Aside from the major changes this revolution 
ushered in for Egypt, it has also changed the 
way Egyptians perceive ICT tools and systems, 
which have created an important platform for 
them to express their opinions, participate in 
public affairs and join together to find solutions 
to issues of common concern. 

Since the revolution, not only has there been 
considerable growth in the number of Egyptians 
using the internet, but significant changes 
in the way the internet is used, with one of 
the more notable shifts being the increase in 
young people engaging with political rather 
than entertainment-related content. 

In this context, three main features of the 
internet are clear: its interactive nature; the 
absence of a central organizational authority, 
making content online more difficult to control 
and monitor than traditional media content; 
and the broad social base of users, which is not 
limited by geographic or political boundaries. 

As a result, those using the internet are not mere 
recipients of content but active participants in 
its formation. This has brought about a change 
in the very nature of communication: ordinary 
members of society are now able to respond 
and interact. Indeed, online dialogue is often 
peer-to-peer in nature, reflecting less the social 

position or political affiliation of interlocutors than 
their opinions on certain topics. Some argue 
that the influence of the internet within society 
and the prevalence of networking have brought 
about a shift from hierarchical state to networking 
community. 

MCIT seeks to embrace this shift, and to empower 
all Egyptians to play a full and active role as digital 
citizens in the development of their community 
and society. 

1.1 The ICT Sector: Past and Present 
The amazing development in ICT usage in Egypt 
would not have occurred without the technical 
and institutional boom set in motion by the 
government since 2000. The newly established 
Ministry of Communications and Information 
Technology set out to establish a vibrant and 
open ICT sector, to ensure wide access to fast 
internet through a solid infrastructure capable 
of attracting investment and supporting the 
development of both the sector and the 
wider economy, and to promote the training 
necessary to enable citizens to adapt ICT tools 
and systems to serve the community and boost 
the economic performance of the state. 
In 2000, MCIT initiated a National ICT Plan to 
ensure the spread and effective use of ICT 
among both individuals and businesses, and 
to establish legislative and regulatory rules 
to guarantee an open market for ICT services. 
As part of this process, MCIT identified best 
practices, critical success factors and potential 
challenges, allowing it to amend ICT policies 
and restructure the sector in response to 
real-time needs. 


1 - Towards a Digital Society and Knowledge-based Economy 1 - Towards a Digital Society and Knowledge-based Economy 
The Egyptian Information Society Initiative, 
introduced in 2004, achieved tremendous 
progress in expanding and modernizing the ICT 
infrastructure. It also laid firm foundations for 
continuous development at a rate at which 
Egyptian society could adapt, reducing the 
digital divide between different sectors of 
society by providing access to high-speed 
internet and ICT tools for individuals and 
institutions. A major success of the initiative 
was the establishment of an educational base 
offering all Egyptians the chance to adopt 
and use ICTs. The plan also focused on using 
ICTs to develop and improve public services, 
particularly in the fields of healthcare and 
education. The 2004 strategy focused on Public 
Private Partnerships and on fair regulation of 
the ICT market. 

Recognizing the essential role of ICT in social 
and economic development, MCIT devised the 
ICT for All program to fulfill two main goals: 
first, raising citizens’ quality of life by helping 
the government improve public service 
provision through the use of ICTs and the 
development of a knowledge-based society; 
and second, facilitating citizens’ access to 
computers and high-speed internet, raising 
youth employability through ICT training, 
thus, encouraging government employees 
to undertake internationally accredited ICT 
certification programs. 

Egypt’s ICT Strategy of 2007 was formulated 
to build on the progress achieved by the 
government in partnership with the private 
sector and civil society.

It focused on establishing local, regional and 
global partnerships attracting investment 
through a range of incentives, and the 
establishment of technology parks such as 
Smart Village and Contact Center Park in Maadi. 

A major component of the strategy was the 
promotion of exports in ICT outsourcing services. 
Strategically located at the crossroads of Europe, 
Africa and the Middle East, and enjoying and a 
large pool of young, multilingual and technically 
proficient human resources, Egypt has quickly 
developed a strong outsourcing industry and 
positioned itself as a world leader in the field. 

The successful growth of Egypt’s ICT sector is 
clear in the following indicators: 


During the period 2008/09-2010/11, the ICT 
sector raised an annual average of LE 33.71 
billion in revenues, with an average annual 
growth rate of 11.63%, and contributed 
about 4% of GDP 
The ICT sector recorded a growth rate of 
3.71% in the last quarter of 2011 
Between 2006 and 2011, the ICT sector 
contributed with LE 82.28 billion to the treasury. 
Egyptian exports of cross-border outsourcing 
services via the internet were worth $1.487 
billion a year by the end of 2011. Egypt, 
represented by the Information Technology 
Industry Development Agency (ITIDA), was 
named Offshoring Destination of the Year in 
2008 by the National Outsourcing Association, 
received a European Outsourcing Award in 
2009 and was ranked fourth in the 2011 
Global Services Localization Index published 
by A.T. Kearney 
At the end of 2011, the number of mobile 
phone subscriptions was about 83.4 million, 
representing a penetration rate of about 
102.76% 


At the end of 2011, the number of internet 
users in Egypt was about 29 million with an 
annual growth rate of 26% 
At the end of 2011, the number of fixed-
line subscribers reached 8.71 million, with a 
penetration rate of 10.91% 
The Smart Village technology park has 
attracted investments amounting to LE 6 
billion and created 40,000 job opportunities 
followed by Cairo Contact Center Park in 
Maadi 
42,000 direct job opportunities and 120,000 
indirect job opportunities were created in the 
last three years through outsourcing and the 
export of technology services 
Despite the difficult 

to 3% in the fourth quarter of 2011. 

The sector has also continued to create jobs, 
with a 41% rise in the number of employees 
of international ICT companies in the Egyptian 
market in 2011 over the previous year and an 
18% rise in those employed by local companies. 
In addition, and according to the Ministry of 
Planning, primary indicators for the third quarter 
of the fiscal year 2011/12 show that the ICT 
sector recorded an increase in real growth rates 
from 2.8% in the third quarter of 2010/11 to 
8.9% in the third quarter of 2011/12. 
In November 2011, a report issued by 
Oxford Business Group noted the significant 
investments in the Egyptian ICT sector despite 
the disturbances following the revolution, and 
that the sector is expected to recover to levels 
seen prior to the revolution and the global 
financial crisis. In 2008/09, the sector attracted 
investment of LE 14 billion.

2 - Vision and Mission 



Vision: 

Towards digital citizenship and an advanced 
knowledge-based economy and support the 
transition to democracy 

At the current stage, the ICT sector needs to 
keep pace with the democratic transition 
and to support the country in its quest to 
realize various political, social and economic 
objectives. This can be achieved by investing 

,

in Egyptianspositive view of ICT tools and 
systems, adapting and developing them to 
serve the needs of a democratic society. This will 
include the development of applications that 
support digital citizenship, social participation 
and integration, which contribute to enhancing 

,

the quality of life and protecting citizensrights 
and social justice. 

Mission: 

To develop a democratic knowledge-based 
society that supports a strong Egyptian 
economy and is based on equitable access 
to information and communications services, 
guaranteeing the digital rights of citizens and 
the development of a national industry based 
on human talent and creativity 

The objectives for the Egyptian ICT sector in the 
coming period are as follows: 

Amendment of existing legislation and/or 
enactment of new legislation appropriate 

,

to the countrys transformation and securing 
a legislative environment conducive to 
domestic and foreign investments and which 
supports the application of e-commerce and 
e-payment systems. 

Expanding the scope of political participation 
and deepening the democratic practice at all 
levels using ICT tools and platforms, building 
on the key role these played in the 25 January 
Revolution. 

Availing information by the government to 
the public through appropriate channels to 
establish a relationship of trust based on 
transparency and interaction. These channels 
should include a forum for community 
dialogue allowing for an open discussion 
among citizens and between citizens and 
government concerning draft laws, decrees 
and national projects. 

Supporting the role civil society organizations 
active in the ICT sector, play in industry 
development through community exchange 
and coordination of efforts for the 
advancement of the sector. These efforts 
facilitate adoption and replication of best 
practices, reduce cost, maximize the return 
on efforts, and boost interaction between 
government institutions involved in or 
sponsoring efforts related to ICT systems. 

Developing a community vision for the 
ICT sector, based on the principle that 
development should occur not only in the 
public service sector but also in the managerial 
approach of the state and its institutions. Such 
a vision will facilitate the adaptation of ICT 
tools and systems to community needs, and 
will allow Egypt to move closer to achieving 
a digital society and digital citizenship. 

Continuation of the shift towards the export 
of high-value-added services, whereby the 
relevant authorities – MCIT, ITIDA and the 
General Authority for Investment and Free 
Zones (GAFI) – work together to promote 
high-value-added outsourcing services 
(including technical support and software 
development and localization), and to attract 
innovative companies able to motivate 
researchers to Egypt. 

Utilization of foreign skills and experience 
to expand high value added services, 
encouraging innovation, and boosting the 
local skills necessary for the development of 
the ICT sector. 

Utilization of the latest techniques and 
technologies, the most important of which 
include those related to 4G technology, Web 
2.0, Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6), high-
speed broadband, next-generation networks, 
smart phones and related technologies, and 
environment-friendly ICTs, including smart 
grids and smart buildings. 

Developing the Egyptian software and ICT 
systems industry, and promoting of its 
exports, to establish a strong “Made in Egypt” 
brand. 

Developing the National Broadband Strategy 
to ensure universal internet access in Egypt 
and the introduction of applications in areas 
of growing importance, such as climate 
change adaptation, energy efficiency and 
sustainable development.

3 - Strategic Objectives and Quantitative Targets 



3.1 Strategic Objectives 
The National ICT Strategy for 2012-2017 aims 
to enable the ICT sector with all its resources to 
help achieve the objectives of the 25 January 
Revolution – freedom, democracy and social 
justice – supported by an open and competitive 
market. It also aims at raising the attractiveness 
of the Egyptian economy to investment, 
increasing revenues for the government and 
the private sector, and facilitating the necessary 
restructuring of the sector in line with global 
innovation in the field. The strategy targets not 
only building a strong national industry capable 
of raising exports and creating job opportunities 
for youth, but also helping to improve the level 
and quality of public services. 

The realization of this vision requires a process 
of cumulative building on achievements in 

,

support of Egypts continued development in 
the realm of ICT, with work on various strategic 
axes in line with the government objective of 
positioning Egypt as one of the most prominent 
knowledge-based economies. 

In this context, Egypt’s strategic ICT objectives are 
characterized by applicability and quantitative 
measurability, allowing for easy monitoring of 
progress. 

The four main strategic objectives of the 
strategy are: 

Supporting the democratic transition 

Promoting digital citizenship and information 
society 

Promoting sustainable development 

Strengthening the national economy 

First: Supporting the democratic transition 

1- Building a knowledge-based society with 
universal access to information resources 

This is served by the National Broadband 
Strategy to expand the geographic coverage of 
infrastructure providing high-speed internet and 
to increase internet penetration, particularly in 
marginalized and under privileged areas. The 
strategy aims to raise the number of subscribers 
to high-speed internet to 13 million by 2015, 
through the expansion of the broadband 
network, especially last mile links and fiber-
optic cables for telephone exchanges. The 
strategy also seeks to raise the proportion of 
Egyptian households using personal computers 
to 40%, to provide a national network of 1,000 
Technology Homes and 2,000 IT Clubs, to 
connect all schools and educational institutions 
to high-speed internet, to expand e-commerce 
by 20%, to increase the number of secured 
Egyptian websites by 810% to increase the 
proportion of banking customers using online 
or mobile banking to 30%, and to increase 
use of e-signature applications by government 
bodies. 

2- Digital identity management 

A large number of digital identity management 
solutions have been developed in recent years 
as part of efforts to build public confidence in 
online transactions and encourage the use of 
electronic services. These ongoing efforts involve 
developing suitable technological tools and 
systems; promoting greater use of e-commerce, 
e-health and e-government services; and 
developing cyber security systems to prevent 
identity theft and protect user privacy. 

22

3 - Strategic Objectives and Quantitative Targets 3 - Strategic Objectives and Quantitative Targets 
3-Maintaining a legislative environment 
conducive to ICT sector growth and investment 

The strategy involves the amendment of a 
numberofexistinglaws.The Telecommunications 
Law No. 10 of 2003, for example, contains 
certain articles that require amendment in 
line with Egypt’s democratic transition that 
will promote political openness and protect 
freedom of expression. Additionally, a number 
of new laws and regulations will be prepared, 
drafted and activated covering areas including 
freedom of information, cybersecurity and 
e-commerce. There are also plans to develop 
labor laws related to working at home and part-
time and temporary employment for university 
students, which will increase the number of 
people working in outsourcing. 

Second: Promoting digital citizenship and 
information society 

1- Using ICTs to empower the elderly 
and people with disabilities, and serve 
marginalized and remote communities 

This will be achieved through developing 
mail services, introducing new services that 
contribute to solving community problems, 
raising the proportion of households with 
personal computers to 40%, and providing a 
national network of 1,000 Technology Homes 
and 2,000 IT Clubs. These services give priority 
to people with disabilities, including those 
who sustained serious injuries during the 25 
January Revolution. Programs have also been 
established to raise the ICT skill levels of 
women, particularly those who act as the sole 
breadwinners of their households. 

24 
25 


2- Internet-related issues, information exchange 
and access, and freedom of expression 

The strategy focuses on various internet-related 
issues, including the right of citizens to unrestricted 
communication, an open internet, strong social 
networks, internet privacy, public radio frequencies, 
public websites, public digital services, freedom of 
movement and association in cyberspace, freedom 
of expression, unrestricted access to information, 
the right of education and access to information 
technology that could be used indiscriminately and 
protection of intellectual property. 

3- Developing people’s ability to communicate 
and connect with their environment 

This will be achieved using information 
and communication cables and networks 
to guarantee citizens their right to personal 
communication and participation, open access 
to means of communication and unrestricted 
access to information. 

4- Developing network security systems 

The strategy includes development of network 
security systems, to support the banking sector 
and online payment systems in particular. The 
increased use of online payment systems will 
promote development of the banking system 
and raise its efficiency. 

5- Online safety and privacy 

Successful promotion of online safety requires 
cooperation between concerned government 
authorities, the private sector and civil society 
focusing on raising public awareness and 
empowerment. The aim is to enable people to 
protect themselves and their children online, 
particularly on social networks, and in their use 
of mobile phones. 

Third: Promoting sustainable development 

1- Improving basic services in the fields of 
education, healthcare, environment and 
ensuring the delivery of subsidy to people 
who deserve it 

The success of initiatives targeting integrated 
development depends largely on the 
availability of easy-to-access high-quality basic 
services and the readiness of local communities 
to evaluate and guarantee the quality of these 
services. In this context, the following three 
basic targets have been identified: 

Poverty reduction and the raising of living 
standards in identified local communities 
through empowerment, facilitating market 
access, improving education and training 
services, and developing basic infrastructure 
networks 

,

Ensuring local communitiesownership of the 
services received through their involvement 
in evaluating the quality of these services 

Building a relationship of trust between the 
government and local communities. Indeed, 
the improvement of the quality and scope 
of basic services reflects the government’s 
commitment to respect, meet and safeguard 

,

citizensrights and to save natural resources 
in the interest of future generations 

In support of these objectives, the strategy 
aims to support and develop the key sectors 
of education and healthcare through the use 
of ICTs. In education, this includes the use 
of computers and high-speed internet in 
educational institutions across the country 
and the development of ICT-based education 
programs and materials, especially for 
university students. This will allow Egyptian 
graduates to compete in the global market and 

enable Egypt to produce and develop ICT tools 
and software to international standards. 

In healthcare, the strategy targets improvement 
of services, particularly for marginalized and 
remote communities, as well as improving 
support systems, enhancing management 
and use of state resources, and reducing 
expenditure. In this context, the development 
of ICT infrastructure for government bodies 
that supports digital identity systems will 
provide citizens with more secure, better and 
faster services and support the transition to a 
knowledge-based society. 

The strategy also aims to promote the 
development of mobile services, expansion 
of mobile coverage in underserved areas, 
adherence to global standards in environmental 
and health protection related to mobile 
stations, development of mobile internet 
access services, use of geo data bases and 
similar systems, and use of ICTs to monitor and 
facilitate adaptation to climate change. 

2- Using ICTs to develop legislative, judicial 
and executive institutions 

The integration of ICTs will raise the efficiency of 
state institutions, developing their performance, 
increasing productivity, improving response 
time, facilitating community participation and 
boosting transparency. These efforts include 
measures to promote the use of e-signature 
applications by government institutions and to 

,

develop key sectors through ICTsintegration, 
including industry, commerce, transport, justice 
and tourism. Development of the legislative 
structure is essential to maintain an environment 
conducive to the further spread of ICT use. 


3 - Strategic Objectives and Quantitative Targets 3 - Strategic Objectives and Quantitative Targets 
Fourth: Strengthening the national economy 

1- Increasing the ICT sector’s contribution to 
GDP to 5% 

This can be achieved through realization of 
growth rates of 710% for the sector for the 
next five years, a 20% increase in investment 
to LE 55 billion, IT service outsourcing exports 
of $2.5 billion, intellectual property revenues 
of $1 billion, the growth of Egypt Post as a 
primary savings facility by an annual average 
of about 15%, and the development of a strong 
Egyptian ICT industry that excels in software 
development and component manufacturing 
and assembly. 

2- Enhancing Egypt’s position as a leading 
global outsourcing destination 

Efforts to enhance Egypt’s position as a global 
leader in outsourcing aim at increasing annual 
export revenues from IT service outsourcing 
to $2.5 billion and intellectual property to 
$1 billion. Measures to achieve these goals 
include: establishing a national network of 
20 technology parks; diversification of target 
markets for Egyptian outsourcing exports; 
promoting greater participation from small 
and medium enterprises (SMEs) in IT service 
outsourcing; increasing the number of 
outsourcing professionals, with the aim of 
creating 75,000 direct job opportunities and 
220,000 indirect job opportunities by the end 
of 2017; attracting more foreign investment 
through global promotional campaigns; and 
maintaining a strong Egyptian presence in 
regional and international fairs, trade missions 
and efforts to protect intellectual property 
rights and personal data. 

26 
27 


3-Creating an environment conducive to 
technology innovation and entrepreneurship 

Efforts to create an environment conducive 
to innovation and entrepreneurship include 
promoting the use of innovative technologies 
to solve development challenges, attracting 
more foreign investment in innovation 
and entrepreneurship, and supporting the 
establishment of local companies capable 
of innovation. The strategy, which aims at 
creating 10,000 job opportunities in the field 
of innovation, will boost and accelerate 
development and help position Egypt as a 
regional innovation center. 

4- Supporting the digital content industry 

The strategy seeks to develop Egypt’s digital 
content industry to promote and preserve 
Egypt’s culture and heritage, and the wider 
Arab identity, and to maintain Egypt’s position 
as a regional leader in this field. The industry 
will provide important opportunities for the 
creation of both employment and exports, while 
enriching Arabic content on the internet. 

The strategy aims to increase the competitiveness 
of the Egyptian digital content industry by 
encouraging the private sector to produce 
and develop Arabic digital content; promoting 
development of the skills required by the digital 
content industry; and supporting universities, 
research centers, centers of excellence and 
companies in developing research and tools to 
enhance digital content, particularly for mobile 
applications. 

5- Strengthening Egypt’s role as a 
communications hub 

The strategy aims to strengthen Egypt’s role as a 
hub for communication cables and transit traffic 
by building on the country’s various competitive 
advantages in the field, which include its 
location at the meeting point of Europe, Africa 
and the Middle East, and a large pool of young, 
multilingual and technically proficient human 
resources. 

6- Raising the competitiveness of Egyptian 
youth in ICT 

This will be achieved through various initiatives 
that aim at providing vocational training for 
young people and equipping them with the 
skills required by the ICT sector, especially in the 
fields of outsourcing and technology innovation. 
These initiatives include the establishment 
of Technology Homes as the first stage in the 
creation of the Technology Corridor of Egypt 

– a virtual corridor that will extend across all 
governorates. Such efforts promote the role of 
young people in development and attract them 
to the ICT sector. 
7- Supporting and developing MSMEs working 
in ICT 

Efforts to develop the role of micro, small and 
medium enterprises in the field of ICT are focused 
on increasing companies’ competitiveness, 
opening new markets and opportunities for 
production, and improving the performance of 
small and micro enterprises outside of Egypt’s 
main cities in order to contribute in creating job 
opportunities and reducing unemployment. 

8- Enhancing Egypt’s position in ICT in the 
regional and international arenas 

MCIT, in cooperation with the Ministry of Foreign 
Affairs, aims at raising Egypt’s performance in 
regional and international ICT indicators. Efforts 
in this regard include strengthening cooperation 
between Egypt and the international community 
in the field of ICT, with priority given to 
cooperation with the Nile Basin countries through 
a technical support program and joint ventures 
targeting the establishment of a knowledge-
based society in the region. MCIT also seeks to 
expand efforts in human capacity building with 
both the Nile Basin and Arab countries through 

,

specialized training programs, to boost Egypts 
role in international dialogue on ICT and related 
issues, and to expand partnerships between 
Egypt and countries around the world. These 
efforts will enable Egypt to attract more foreign 
investment, thereby increasing ICT sector 
growth and creating employment opportunities 
for young people.

4 - Developing Relevant Legislation 



There is no doubt that a supportive legislative 
environment for the ICT sector is fundamental 
to its success and its ability to attract local and 
foreign investment. 

Egypt has issued various laws relating to the 
ICT sector over the last 10 years, covering areas 
including regulation of telecommunications, 
e-signatures and protection of intellectual 
property. However, due to the growth of the 
sector, as well as the fast pace of change in 
ICT, new or amended legislation is required to 
ensure that the rights of investors, employees 
and the public are fully protected by the law. 
Furthermore, since the ICT sector has since its 
inception been a pillar of the national economy, it 
is important in light of Egypt’s current democratic 
transition to maintain a legislative environment 
that boosts the sector’s ability to grow and to 
support other sectors of the economy. 

In the final quarter of 2011, MCIT formed a 
committee of legal and technical experts to 
formulate a set of new regulations for the 
coming phase, and to propose modifications, 
where appropriate, to existing regulations. 

Telecommunications Law No. 10 of 2003 has 
since been amended, and the committee is 
soon to present its proposed amendments to 
E-Signature Law No. 15 of 2004. The committee 
has also begun work to formulate draft laws 
relating to freedom of information, cybersecurity 
and e-commerce. 

When drafting bills, the committee first examines 
relevant legislation from other countries and 
reviews reports and opinions from civil society 
organizations and specialists. Committee 
members then discuss and formulate the draft 
law, which passes through several rounds of 
review before presentation to parliament. 

4.1 Telecommunications Law No. 10 of 2003 
Telecommunications Law No. 10 of 2003 was 
one of the laws most in need of amendment due 
to its political dimensions. During the 25 January 
Revolution, the governing authorities found legal 
justification in Articles 65 and 67 of this law to 
disconnect various means of communication, 
even though this action restricted the basic right 
of freedom of expression. 

After the revolution, MCIT, in response to public 
demand, initiated a community dialogue 
concerning necessary amendments to the 
law. The ministry then formed a committee 
charged with reviewing existing legislation 
and drafting new laws, in consultation with 
experts and representatives from the ICT sector 
and concerned civil society organizations and 
taking into consideration the views raised 
through the community dialogue also opened 
a dialogue and discussion with the National 
Telecommunications Regulatory Authority on 
this law. 

The committee proposed the amendment of 
about 55 articles, divided into five groups, and 
the addition of articles, as follows: 

Group 1: 

Amendments to definitions applied in the 
law and items concerning the formation of 
the National Telecommunication Regulatory 
Authority board of directors 

Article 1: Definitions (telecommunications, 
broadcasting, national security and state 
media) 

Article 12: Formation and membership of the 
NTRA board of directors

Article 15: Term of office of the executive 
president of the NTRA 

Article 25: Licensing obligations 

Group 2: 

Amendments to items concerning regulation of 
the relationship between telecommunications 
companies 

Article 28: Linkage between companies 

Articles 33 and 34: Implementation of the 
resolution until a final ruling is passed 

Article 40: Regulation of the relationship

usufruct 

Group 3: 

Amendments to items concerning technological 
progress 

Article 54 : Spectrumdivision after the switchover 
from analog to digital 

Article 64 : Addition of technologies and software 
to equipment used for encryption 

Group 4: 

Amendments to items concerning the authority 
to disconnect communications 

The most important amendments to the law 
involved Articles 65 and 67, which stipulated that in 
the case of general mobilization the prime minister 
should determine the competent state authority to 
manage all telecommunications services, networks, 
operators and service providers. The conditions for 
such a general mobilization included natural and 
environmental disasters and national security threats.

Article 65, original: 

The National Telecommunication Regulatory 
Authority shall, in cooperation with the Armed 
Forces and the concerned state entities, prepare a 
prior plan for the operation of telecommunications 
networks, to be implemented during natural or 
environmental disasters and periods of general 
mobilization according to the provisions of Law 
No. 87 of 1960 concerning general mobilization 
and any other circumstances related to national 
security. The plan shall be updated periodically 
in order to secure national defense and security. 
Telecommunications operators and service 
providers shall be obliged to implement the 
plan. 

Article 65, amended: 

The National Telecommunication Regulatory 
Authority shall, in cooperation with the 
Ministry of Defense and the concerned state 
entities, prepare a detailed prior plan for the 
operation of telecommunications networks, 
to be implemented during periods of general 
mobilization, according to the provisions of Law 
No. 87 of 1960 concerning general mobilization, 
that shall be limited to tension in international 
relations, the threat of war, actual war, natural 
or environmental disasters, or crises threatening 
national security. The plan shall include the 
determination of the authority to which some 
or all telecommunications services, networks, 
operators and service providers, as well as those

concerning state media and content licenses. 

4.2 Freedom of Information Draft Law 
In light of the wide information space in which we 
live today, and in support of Egypt’s democratic 
transition, the Freedom of Information Law 
will fulfill certain important aspirations of the 
Egyptian people, enshrining in law their right 
to access data and information, and serving to 
stabilize democratic practice. 

This freedom, along with many others prevalent 
in democratic practice, provides an indication of 
political maturity, as with it comes responsibility. 
For this reason, the new law relies on specific 
measures and mechanisms to maintain the 
right balance between freedom of access to 
information and preventing misuse of this 
freedom. The basis of this law, therefore, is that 
access to information is the norm, and prevention 
the exception, but in a manner that does not 
infringe on the right to personal privacy or pose 
a risk to national security. The talk about the 
availability of information could harm national 
security of Egypt or the exposure of relations 
with other countries at risk under the banner of 
freedom is not acceptable, so this law sought 
to bring about the desired balance between the 
considerations of freedom as a fundamental 
human rights and privacy considerations and 
national security. 


4 - Developing Relevant Legislation 4 - Developing Relevant Legislation 
Around the world there are about 85 countries 
with legislation in this field and two main 
approaches. The European approach is based on 
the formation of specialized entities to uphold 
the law and to review complaints and disputes, 
while the American approach favors the settling 
of disputes by the judiciary. 

The Laws and Regulations Committee, favoring 
the adoption of the European approach, formed 
the Supreme Council for Data and Information 
to proceed with the drafting of the Freedom of 
Information Law. 

This law covers regulation of access to data and 
information; the measures to be taken when 
access is withdrawn to information that should 
be readily available or if this information is 
manipulated; protection of information with the 
potential to affect national and public security; 
and protection of personal information and 
criminalization of its use for purposes other than 
that for which it was provided. 

The law prohibits disclosure of data and 
information that may result in: harming the 
interests of the country; betrayal of trust; direst 
damage to the economic interests of others; 
endangering relations with a foreign country 
or a regional or international organization; or 
facilitating crime or obstructing its discovery. 
It also protects against failure to disclose 
information that should be in the public sphere; 
intentional destruction of data and information 
records and registries; disclosure of falsified, 
incorrect or deficient data and information; and 
disclosure of private information belonging to 
others. 

The Supreme Council for Data and Information is 
mandated to regulate the disclosure, circulation 
and correction of data and information. This 

34 
35 

council is granted immunity similar to that of 
judicial authorities, and its decisions are binding 
unless superseded by a decision from the 
Administrative Court. 

The duties of the council include establishing the 
necessary security classifications for data and 
information; monitoring provision of data and 
information; promoting a culture of disclosure 
of information; and cooperating with national, 
regional and international authorities concerned 
with freedom of information. 

The council includes seven experienced full-time 
members chosen by the Shoura Council from 
nominations provided by the prime minister, 
the first deputy of the head of the Cassation 
Court, the first deputy of the head of the State 
Council, and one representative from each of the 
Ministry of Defense, the Ministry of Interior and 
the General Intelligence Agency. These full-time 
members cannot be employees of the state’s 
administrative system and are prohibited from 
engaging in politics. 

Outcome: 

A comprehensive law was drafted in seven 
chapters, containing 50 articles. It represents the 
biggest response possible to the requirements 
of civil society, taking into consideration national 
security dimensions, and corresponding with the 
most recent legislation of its kind in the world. 

4.3 Cybersecurity Draft Law 
The three main axes of the Cybersecurity Draft 
Law relate to: 

Protecting cyberspace and its contents from 
any external violation 

Agencies’ obligations towards protecting 
their information space, and the data and 

information included therein, particularly 
personal information 

Creating a national authority responsible for 
monitoring all cybersecurity activities and 
issuing licenses to operate within this domain 

The law defines the obligations of those 
controlling data and information and establishes 
rules to ensure they secure their information 
space as well as the data, systems, programs and 
networks contained therein. It also establishes a 
system to manage the operation of information 
resources, and means of securing information 
operation sites and accessing information and 
networks. Additionally, the law aims to combat 
crime related to information systems and 
networks in order to help maintain national 
security, preserve the rights of legitimate users 
of computers and information networks, and 
protect the public interest. 

The draft law includes definitions of various 
terms contained therein, including both tools of 
operation and forms of criminal activity, such as 
piracy, hacking, malware and infiltration. 

The law establishes the National Authority for 
Information Security, whose authorities and 
powers include establishing an information 
security strategy, promoting a culture of 
information security, and registration and 
licensing of information security service 
providers. Also define obligations on the 
controller of information, and to develop a 
system to manage the operation of IT resources, 
and how to secure sites and how to access 
information and networks, also singled out a 
special chapter for experts, and stressed may 
not engage in any act of experience in the field 
of information security only after enrollment 
in the register national experts at the national 
authority for information security. 

The law stiffens penalties for those committing 
information crimes, with imprisonment for 
not less than six months and/or a fine of 
between LE 20,000 and LE 50,000. It also 
doubles the minimum and maximum penalties 
in certain situations, such as for crimes 
committed with intent to damage the public 
interest or an individual public authority, or 
the creation, duplication or possession with 
the aim of distribution, publication or sale of 
materials violating public decency, particularly 
if they involve children. It also provides for 
imprisonment and fining in case of re-offense. 

In preparing and formulating the draft law, the 
Laws and Regulations Committee relied on 
various reference materials. These included: 
International Telecommunication Union (ITU) 
recommendations regarding cybersecurity; 
relevant Indian law; the Legislation Management 
Draft Law of the Ministry of Justice; the Decision 
Support Center Draft Law; the Convention on 
Cybercrime (Budapest Agreement) of the Council 
of Europe; and “Cybercrime,” by information 
security expert Ahmed El-Sobky. 

Outcome: 

A comprehensive law was drafted containing 
over 70 articles. It represents the biggest 
response possible to the requirements of civil 
society, taking into consideration the national 
security dimension, and corresponding with the 
most recent legislation of its kind in the world. 

4.4 E-Commerce Draft Law 
The Laws and Regulations Committee will, during 
the coming period, work on the preparation and 
drafting of the E-Commerce Draft Law. 

4.5 E-Signature Draft Law 
The Laws and Regulations Committee will, during 
the coming period, work on the preparation and 
drafting of amendments to E-Signature Law No. 
15 of 2004. 


5 - General and Targeted Strategic Policies 



In light of the rapid and ongoing growth of the 
ICT sector, developing policies and regulations 
related to modern technologies is a strategic 
national priority. The importance of determining 
and adopting the right policies stems from the 
need to establish the foundations, mechanisms 
and procedures through which strategies can be 
successfully implemented, with close attention 
to protecting the interests of individuals and 
society, and identifying users’ duties and 
responsibilities. 

The policies adopted in previous strategic plans 
were successful in ensuring the ICT sector’s 
ability to meet increasing demand. From 
October 2010 to October 2011, the number of 
internet users increased by 20.36% from 23.06 
million to 27.75 million, while the number of 
mobile internet subscribers grew by 15.7%. 

MCIT therefore established various work 
programs to develop and determine policies in 
light of strategic planning aims, research and 
analytical studies. These programs aim at: 

Drafting and updating policies and guiding 
principles concerning ICT use in local 
development 

Contributing to the development of legislative 
and regulatory frameworks related to the ICT 
sector 

Supporting the development of strategies 
to increase the spread and use of ICTs and 
maximize their benefit to users and society 

Monitoring developments in technology 

36 
37 


The National ICT Strategy for 2012 - 2017 was 
formulated with special attention to the 
following considerations: 
Drafting policies with the greatest flexibility 
to respond to the increasing demand for 
communications services through continuous 
development of ICT infrastructure. This can be 
facilitated by market studies determining the 
priority needs of consumers and the business 
sector and at the same time be aware of the 
challenges faced by the consuming sectors 
for this kind of service 
Drafting the most comprehensive policies 
possible, enabling Egypt to excel in using ICTs 
for development. This can be achieved by 
providing ICT infrastructure in marginalized 
areas, encouraging inter-company use of 
ICTs, increasing ICT access for Arabic speakers, 
and providing support for SMEs, which can 
play an important role in ICT service exports 
and the production of Arabic digital content 
Drafting policies that have quantifiable 
objectives and whose progress is easy to 
monitor 
MCIT will review the policies of the strategy 
and make modifications as and when required, 
in accordance with government policies and 
priorities, in response to relevant developments 
in the ICT field. 
The policies contained in the strategy are 
divided into two types, as follows: 
General Policies: 
These policies apply to all projects and programs 
for the ICT sector due to their importance both 
to Egypt and the international community. They 
relate to issues that have a clear and direct 
impact on the success and effectiveness of ICT 
sector activities. These policies cover: 
Digital identity management 
Green ICT 
Empowerment of people with disabilities 
Access to information 
Mobile applications for development 
Targeted Policies: 
These policies apply to a limited number of 
programs in certain fields. They relate to areas 
of particular importance at the current time 
that will also help boost future development of 
the ICT sector. These policies cover: 
Arabic digital content 
Cloud computing 
e-Commerce 
Manufacturing of tablet computers 
Open-source software

6 - Strategic Pillars and Executive Work Programs 

The National ICT Strategy for 2012-2017 comprises 
seven main work pillars that represent the executive 
tracks for programs and projects related to the ICT 
sector in the next five years. These pillars reflect 
the objectives of the strategic plan, with each pillar 
aiming to achieve one or more objectives. The pillars 
are: the Telecom and postal services infrastructure, 
Government ICT infrastructure and digital services, 
national capacity building, digital citizenship, IT industry 
development, ICT innovation and entrepreneurship 
and international cooperation. 

6.1 Telecommunications and Postal Service Infrastructure 
In light of the global communications revolution 
and in support of Egypt’s democratic transition, 
MCIT and the ICT sector will proceed in developing 
the national ICT infrastructure to serve the 
growing needs of government, business and 
individuals. International experience shows that 
advanced ICT infrastructure is a major driver of 
economic activity across all sectors. 

This pillar is concerned with: implementation of 
the National Broadband Strategy through the 
National Initiative for Broadband; modernization 
of the postal network and diversification of postal 
services; and Cybersecurity and safety. 

The primary strategic objectives of this pillar are:

7 - Targeted Strategic Initiatives 



The targeted initiatives of the National ICT 
Strategy for 2012-2017 aim to enhance Egypt’s 
global position in the field of ICT globally and 
to increase the contribution of the sector 
to the GDP. There is a general agreement 
among the ICT community that the targeted 
initiatives identified below have a priority in 
implementation and address specific challenges 
and needs that are high on the national agenda. 
The initiatives will also play an important role 
in empowering the Egyptian society and in 
contributing to the sustainable development 
goals by offering higher quality series at lower 
cost to the Egyptian citizen. 

The targeted strategic initiatives include: 

Digital Identity Management Initiative 
Arabic Digital Content Initiative 
Educational Reform Initiative using ICTs, Cloud 
Computing and the Tablet Computer 
Back to Africa Initiative 
ICT for Empowering People with Disabilities 
Initiative (PWDs) 
Green ICT Initiative 
In addition, the Broadband Initiative was launched 
in September 2011 and is considered a key 
milestone in the ICT sector plan. The initiative 
aims at promoting the high-speed Internet 
industry in Egypt with its three elements: 
networks, services and users, establishing 
the leading position of Egypt in the region in 
this field in light of the changes experienced 
by the country and the massive demand on 

the internet speed and the quality of services 
provided, in addition to the increased desire of 
users for accessing the visual content, news 
and multimedia services. The national plan of 
the Broadband Initiative (eMisr) was launched 
and comprises two phases: 

The objectives of the initiative are summarized 
as follows: 

Egypt to reach a leading position in the digital 
communication field 

Stimulating economic growth nationwide 
and enhancing social cohesion 

Increasing job opportunities 

Coordinating with other Egyptian government 
sectors and improving the standard of living 
and the quality of life for all citizens 

Bridging the digital gap in Egypt 

These objectives were identified for their 
relevance to the current priorities of Egypt 
and the major world economies. Egypt’s 
previous national ICT strategies supported the 
establishment of solid telecommunications 
infrastructure, development of a vibrant ICT 
sector, growth in access to and use of ICTs, 
empowerment and capacity building. Looking 
forward, the current strategy, while building 
on and developing these efforts, also aims to 
unlock the latent potential of ICTs to promote 
and support advancement not only for the 
sector, but for the wider economy and society 
as a whole.

7 - Targeted Strategic Initiatives 7 - Targeted Strategic Initiatives 
7.1 Digital Identity Management Initiative 
Digital identity management has become of 
great importance in the internet economy. 
In the mid-nineties, the ability to access 
information via internet was considered a 
revolutionary transition. Very quickly, the 
internet changed from a one side posting 
tool to a two way platform providing personal 
services, e-commerce, e-government services 
and other various and different interactive such 
as e-health, e-education and social networks. 
Increasingly providing and spreading services 
online in daily life has radically changed our 
economies and societies, making the provision 
of these services a must for building the 
internet economy. 

On the other hand, the Egyptian government 
has been increasingly concerned with 
enhancing resources, encouraging investments, 
rationalizing expenditures and distributing 
the basic resources in an equitable and fair 
manner. ICT networks play a basic role in this 
context, since communication networks and 
the internet are part of the country’s economic 
infrastructure, especially in banking services, 
e-commerce, trading and financing system. 
Communication networks and IT also play, on 
the political, economic and social levels, a 
major role affecting citizens’ daily life through 
different applications such as e-government, 
e-voting, education and health services, etc… 

Hence, a pressing need appeared for 
developing a national project for managing the 
digital identity based on a clear and integrated 
strategy. Indeed, the management of the digital 

60 
61 


identity with its various levels is considered one 
of the most important processes for securing 
and organizing transactions electronically. This 
initiative involves developing the infrastructure, 
technologies and policies required to create, 
identify, manage and coordinate the ownership, 
use and protection of personal information, 
including a framework to define digital identity 
data for government information systems and 
individuals and entities executing transactions 
via the internet. 

Description: 

Digital identity management, at its different 
levels, is considered one of the most important 
operations for regulating and securing 
cyberspace transactions. Digital identity 
consists of all credentials and attributes 
related to an individual on the internet, 
such as the computer IP address, the email 
address, passwords, user name or nickname 
used in chatting rooms and forums, electronic 
account on websites that require a registered 
account for participation and activities. It also 
includes bank account numbers authorizing 
the person to deal with his/her bank account 
electronically through the bank’s website on 
the Internet, transfer of funds, services and 
billing. It also includes e- commerce, where 
users can purchase via the internet using 
credit cards, voting, health information and 
data. All these are considered examples of 
electronic identity whose importance has 
increased with the penetration and expansion 
of internet access. Digital identity management 

for facilities, banking sector, individuals and 
private sector, is considered one of the most 
important mechanisms required for regulating 
transactions, rationalizing consumption, and 
increasing the efficiency of availing services 
which require careful coordination at the 
national level. 

The primary objectives of this initiative are: 

Applying the highest level of security in the 
collection, use and storage of documents 
containing personal data, ensuring that 
unnecessary documents are removed from 
storage in an appropriate manner and that 
information retrieval is fast and efficient 

Providing citizens with electronic cards, 
containing accurate personal and biometric 
information, including electronic signature, 
to facilitate and secure transactions with 
government authorities 

Increasing the ease and speed of checking 
user data to raise performance in the 
provision of government services 

Improving the quality of services provided 
to citizens through shared use of digital 
identity applications and records by various 
institutions 

Improving and integrating operations systems 
for various government service providers to 
ensure efficient use of resources, eliminate 
repetition of routine procedures, and focus on 
raising service quality 

Helping organizations control and secure 
the flow of information with partners and 
customers, and to cooperate with each other, 
thereby promoting economic growth 

Promoting use of digital identity applications 
to facilitate the provision and use of local, 
regional and international services by 
institutions and individuals, saving time, 
effort and money 

Reducing threats to data security and privacy 
by limiting the amount of data circulated 
between institutions to that which is essential 

Facilitating the collection of accurate statistics 
and the formulation of plans for all sectors of 
the economy 

Supporting all sectors of the economy through 
the exchange and updating of information 
via a central source 

Encouraging innovation in the market, 
the creation of new job opportunities and 
increasing foreign trade 

Facilitating an effective response and 
the ability to adapt to internet threats by 
increasing security on the internet, reducing 
cybercrime, improving the safety of networks 
and systems, raising overall safety levels for 
consumers and promoting confidence in the 
internet

7.2 Arabic Digital Content Initiative 
MCIT and the ICT sector in Egypt consider 

the support of Arabic digital content on 
the internet, a top priority that allows the 
internet to reach more Arabic-speaking 

communities around the world, and hence 
preserving and promoting Arab heritage and 
identity for coming generations. These efforts 
are of great importance given that Arabic 
online content is estimated to constitute 
only about 1% to 1.5% of the global totals. 
The Arabic content industry includes 
hardcopy and soft copy outputs, all forms of 
media, culture, service and communication 
products such as books, musical recordings, 
databases, newspapers and magazines, 
heritage documents, multimedia, software, 
governmental documents, scientific publishing, 
radio and personal programs, product catalogues, 
business activity documents, photo banks, 
patents, etc. Hence it is an integrated industrial 
process, information building industry and a 
structuring of its investment as per user needs. 
MCIT works to develop the Arabic digital 
content industry in Egypt in cooperation with 
local, regional and international organizations 
such as the Arab League, ESCWA, UNESCO, 
the International Telecommunication Union 
in addition to stakeholders from the private 
sector, government and civil society. 

Description: 

The Arabic Digital Content Initiative aims at 
enhancing Arabic digital content production 
and promoting its use in order to support 
human and social development, facilitate 
Egypt’s transition to a knowledge-based 
society, and preserve and promote Arab and 
Islamic heritage and identity. This requires 

the establishment of a strong digital content 
industry, providing content in written, audio 
and visual formats accessible through 
various channels, and the development and 
enrichment of creative Arabic digital content. 
The initiative involves cooperation between 
Arab countries to integrate efforts in the 
development of Arabic digital content, share 
resources, experience and expertise, and avoid 
duplication of efforts. 

The primary objectives of this initiative are: 

Establishing a national strategy with a clear 
vision and objectives to enrich and digitize 
Arabic content, promote creativity in the

developing the capabilities of teaching staff 
and students, and expanding the role of 
educational institutions in their communities. 

Looking forward, cloud-computing technologies 
offer great potential in the field of education. 
As teaching materials and resources are stored 
on central databases, they are accessible 
anywhere, at any time, via the internet. This 
reduces costs for educational institutions as 
they can access content on a pay-per-use 
basis rather than having to purchase various 
software packages and licenses and maintain 
equipment with sufficient processing power 
and memory to store and use them. As this 
system can be accessed anywhere with an 
internet connection, the space occupied by 
static computer labs can be developed for other 
uses. Cloud computing also supports the work 
of scientists and researchers, and promotes 
economic growth by reducing education 
expenditure and promoting local production of 
digital education materials, cloud computing 
software and tablet computers. 

The primary objectives of the Initiative are: 

Strengthening the national commitment to 
building a model of educational reform that 
can be replicated in other Arab and African 
countries 

Promoting research and development and 
supporting scientific research in the field of 
ICT for education 

Establishing a culture of e-learning among 
public and private educational institutions 
and developing e-courses for use in state 
education 

Developing regulations and mechanisms 
covering the production and use of e-learning 
materials by educational institutions, and 
determining standards for the evaluation of 
such materials 

Boosting the internet economy and 
creating new job opportunities 

Providing Egyptian producers of digital content 
and applications with new opportunities to 
reach large numbers of learners at low cost 

Raising the contribution of the electronics 
industry in the GDP 

Developing the technology skills of university 
teaching staff and students 

Developing the skills of engineers and 
technicians for work in the electronics industry 
(Tablet Computer) to support national growth 

Establishing a plan for sustainable 
environmental protection and management 
of natural resources, energy and e-waste.

7.4 Back to Africa Initiative 
Egypt enjoys strong historical and cultural 
ties with the Africa continent. These ties are 
particularly strong with the Nile Basin countries. 
The Egyptian government seeks to build on its 
long-standing relations in Africa in all fields, 
and since the 25 January Revolution this goal 
has been designated a national priority. 

In this context, the Back to Africa Initiative seeks 
to use Egypt’s progress in the ICT sector, in terms 
of infrastructure, policies and human resources, 
to further strengthen its ties throughout the 
continent on the bilateral and regional levels, 
while promoting sustainable human and social 
development and establishing a strong ICT 
infrastructure, that would contribute to bridging 
the digital divide in Africa. 

The primary objectives of this initiative are: 
Enhancing Egypt’s role in Africa:

at addressing critical challenges facing the 
continent: poverty, development and Africa’s 
marginalization internationally. 

NEPAD provides opportunities for African 
countries to take full control of their 
development agenda, to work more closely 
together, and to cooperate more effectively 
with international partners. 

NEPAD manages a number of programs and 
projects in six thematic areas: 

Agriculture and food security 

Climate change and national resource 
management 

Regional integration and infrastructure 

Human development 

Economic and corporate governance 

Cross-cutting issues, including gender, 
capacity development and ICT 

The ICT track includes the e-Africa program, 
created to develop policies, strategies and 
projects at the continent’s . The program aims 
to pursue cross-sector initiatives to entrench 
ICT in all sectors, develop e-services and raise 
Africa’s digital competitiveness.

7.5 ICT for Empowering People with 
Disabilities 
Initiative 
Ensuring communication with all segments 
of the Egyptian society and providing ICT for 
development services are two of the most 
important objectives of the ministry. In order 
to achieve these objectives, the ministry has 
worked since its inception to build a strong 
information society. However, and despite 
all effort, the needs of PWD remains a major 
challenge. 

MCIT is paying a special attention to people 
with disabilities in the 2012- 2017 sector 
strategy. The ministry is currently working on 
a long-term strategy with the participation 
of representatives of this group that focuses 
on integrating people with disabilities in 
the Egyptian society, rehabilitating and 
empowering them through information and 
communications technology in order to ensure 
their participation in the development process. 

Current status assessment: 

Egypt is a signatory to the UN Convention on 
the Rights of Persons with Disabilities in 2007, 
supporting the efforts of the United Nations 
to change attitudes and approaches to people 
with disabilities, and to ensure they are able to 
enjoy their full rights, make decisions for their 
lives based on their free and informed consent, 
and function as active members of society. 

In the same year, Egypt held the First Arab 
Regional Forum on Sharing Experience on 
Best Practices in ICT Services for Persons with 
Disabilities. The resulting Cairo Declaration 
on Supporting Access to Information and 
Communications Technology Services for 
Persons with Disabilities emphasized the need 
to develop and use ICTs as assistive tools to 

provide services to people with disabilities, 
and identify the roles of government entities, 
research centers, universities, civil society and 
the private sector in providing such services. 
The declaration also covered legislation and 
regulations, collection of accurate information 
and statistics, means to increase opportunities 
for employment, and provision of access 
to high-quality ICT devices and services at 
affordable prices. 

Description: 

The ICT for Empowering People with 
Disabilities Initiative, is a long-term strategy, 
involving the participation of people with 
disabilities and organizations representing 
their interests. The Initiative focuses on

Egyptian society, and empowering them 
through ICTs. It aims at removing barriers 
and facilitating opportunities for people 
with disabilities – using ICTs to develop their 
abilities and potential – and enabling them to 
enjoy their rights, fulfill their responsibilities, 
and participate fully in developing their 
communities and society. 

The primary objectives of this initiative are: 

Promoting access to information and

7.6 Green ICT Initiative 
In line with Egypt’s aim to reduce greenhouse 
gas emissions and play an active role in 
international efforts to promote sustainable 
development both locally and internationally, 
programs have been adopted in a number of 
sectors to reduce emissions and protect the 
environment. 
In this context, the ICT sector has a special 
role to play in reducing emissions and limiting 
the environmental impact not only of its 
own activities but across all sectors, thereby 
supporting sustainable economic and social 
development. On a global level, the sector has 
the potential to significantly reduce emissions 
in other sectors for only a low increase in its 
own emissions. 
MCIT’s efforts in the field of green ICT – in 
cooperation with governmental and nongovernmental 
organizations, international 
organizations and the private sector – include 
programs in the following areas of focus: 
Sustainable management and development 
of the ICT sector: 
Establishing a framework for the Green ICT 
Strategy for 2012-2015 
Coordinating green ICT at the national level 
Sustainable management of e-waste 
Recycling of e-waste 
Policies and legislation 
Exchange of experience and knowledge 
Research 
Raising community awareness 
ICT sector support of environment-friendly 
sustainable development in other sectors 
The primary objectives of this initiative are: 
Supporting sustainable development on the 
national level 
Accelerating economic growth by encouraging 
investment in green ICT 
Setting national policies for green ICT 
Raising public awareness of ICTs and their 
relation to the environment

8 - Conclusion 



8.1 Monitoring and Evaluation 
Given the pivotal role of the ICT sector in the 
development and growth of all sectors of the 
economy, and the cross- sectoral nature of 
many of the programs and initiatives of the 
National ICT Strategy for 2012-2017, MCIT has 
adopted an integrated approach to monitoring 
and evaluating the implementation of activities 
related to the strategy. 

This approach rests on three axes, as follows: 

First: Executive Structure 

The framework for decision-making, determination 
of priorities and monitoring work depends on three 
main pillars: 

Table 8.1: Executive Structure 

Executive structure: Formation of an integrated 
group of committees to monitor programs/ 
initiatives at all levels, with the inclusion of a 
number of primary beneficiaries 

Human resources: Selection of committee 
members according to their areas of expertise 

Information: Preparation of periodic reports on 
programs/ initiatives to assist decision makers 
and committee members in monitoring 
progress and taking necessary action

8 - Conclusion 8 - Conclusion 
Second: Monitoring and Evaluation Processes 

Monitoring and evaluation of progress and 
performance in the various programs and 
initiatives of the strategy requires the collection 
of data during project implementation for 
periodic analysis in reference to project plans 
and agreed standards, after which an array of 
indicators are determined to assess outputs. 

The evaluation strategy is based on three main 
axes, as follows: 

1- Development of ICT sector performance 
indicators 

2- Monitoring and Follow-up: 

Monitoring project inputs in order to improve 
operational frameworks 

Monitoring project activities and following up 
to achieve desired outcomes 

Monitoring factors that could affect project 
implementation with a view to developing 
solutions 

Evaluating project outputs using clear indicators 
to assess levels of achievement against initial 
targets 

Following up with project beneficiaries to 
gather perceptions, comments and complaints 

Financial follow-up of projects 

3- Assessing Change in Target Categories 

Ongoing assessment of project outputs 
during the implementation phase followed 
by evaluation of outcomes in relation to 
initial plans 

Participatory approach to monitoring and 
evaluation where project partners cooperate 
in assessments

Third: Analysis of Project Outcomes 

Project outcomes are to be evaluated based 
on efficiency, effectiveness and sustainability, 
providing valuable information for the expansion 
or replication of programs.

8.2 Conclusion 
The efforts of MCIT since its establishment 
in 1999 have led to the emergence of an 
ICT sector that has driven forward human, 
social and economic development on the 
national level, and earned a solid reputation 
both regionally and internationally. With the 
National ICT Strategy for 2012-2017, MCIT aims 
to promote the continued growth of Egypt’s 
ICT sector, which has an important role to 
play in supporting the country’s transition to 
democracy. 

The initiatives and programs of the strategy, 
which cover a wide range of themes and sectors, 
are being implemented through public- private 
partnerships – involving cooperation between 
MCIT, other ministries and government entities, 
civil society organizations, regional and 
international organizations, and the private 
sector. MCIT favors this approach as the sharing 
of responsibilities and efforts, and the resulting 
successes, guarantees the active engagement 
of stakeholders in the future of the sector and 
society at large.
