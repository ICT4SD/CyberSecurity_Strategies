1. INTRODUCTION
The National Information and Communications Technology Policy has been
developed by Government of Malawi to give direction on ICT development in the
country.

The ICT Policy will support the national goal of wealth creation and reduction of
poverty through sustainable economic growth and infrastructure development.
The policy is providing a framework for deployment, exploitation and development
of ICT to support the process of accelerated socio-economic development in
Malawi.

Government

development,

will

provide

direction

for

systematic

implementation, monitoring and review

ICT

program

through this

policy.

Government aims at consolidating an ICT approach for the mobilization, allocation
and utilization of resources to realize institutional, community, sector and national
development policies and strategies.
This

ICT

Policy

covers

Information

Technology

(IT),

Telecommunications,

Broadcasting and Postal services.
The ICT Policy aims at guiding:
a. The provision of ICT services in the rural areas and to the vulnerable groups;
b. The investment in priority ICT areas;
c. The Public Sector in the planning for the national development and utilization
of ICT; and
d. The formulation of an appropriate regulatory and legal framework aimed at
safeguarding

fundamental

human

rights,

protecting

privacy,

promoting

electronic services, and promoting competition in the ICT sector.

1.1. BACKGROUND
ICT has increasingly become one of the dominant factors affecting every facet of
development not only in Malawi but the world over. Significant ICT advances are
constantly taking place and continue to impact on socio-economic operations at
various levels of society. ICT advances have brought about changes in the way
business is conducted.

At the moment nations and organizations are investing
1

more resources into the development and use of ICT in order to be more efficient
and effective in their operations.
Malawi, as one of the developing economies in the world, has over the years faced
a number of socio-economic challenges which are associated, among other things,
with inadequate communication infrastructure, very low utilization of ICTs and
lack of information.
Major reforms in the ICT sector started in the 1990s through separation and
commercialization of the then incumbent Telecom operator and Post Office into
Malawi Telecom Limited (MTL) and Malawi Postal Corporation (MPC), respectively.
These reforms were supported by the Communications Sector Policy and the
Communications Act of 1998. In addition, through the

Act, the Malawi

Communications Regulatory Authority (MACRA) was established. However, with
passage of time, the 1998 Communications Sector Policy has been overtaken by
the significant developments in ICT.
The Millennium Development Goals (MDG) report of 2011 for Malawi indicates
that use of Internet by the population in Malawi improved from the low levels of
0.07 percent in 2005 to 17 percent in 2011. Use of mobile and fixed telephones
(tele-density) has improved from 2.63 percent to about 27 percent in the same
period. This is largely due to the increase in use of mobile telephones. While data
on computer ownership and use for Malawi is not available, the country has a very
low computer density as compared to other countries in the African region.
Furthermore, most of the telephones and computers are concentrated in urban
areas. Government of Malawi, through various initiatives, has provided a total of
51 tele-centres that are currently operating in rural areas, providing access to ICT
equipment and Internet services to the general public. Currently Malawi is ranked
number 159 out of the 190 countries on the UNDP’s e-government development
index.
For Malawi to play a meaningful role in the global economy, the above status
needs to improve.

1.2. LINKAGES WITH OTHER RELATED POLICIES
A number of existing policies, legislation and programmes have in one way or
another informed and fostered the development of this ICT Policy. Within the ICT
2

sector, relevant policies that have contributed to the development of the Policy
including the 1998 Communications Sector Policy, Digital Broadcasting Policy of
2013 and the Science and Technology Policy.
2020,

the

Other policies include the Vision

Malawi Growth and Development Strategy

Development Goals (Goal 8:

II,

the

Millennium

Developing Global Partnerships) and the 1998

National Decentralization Policy.

In addition to the above, several existing

enactments and programs have also encouraged this process.

Of particular

significance include the Communications Act (1998), the Science and Technology
Act of 2003.

3

1.3. PROBLEM DEFINITION
In terms of the ICT Sector, Malawi is faced with the following challenges:
i.

Inadequate ICT infrastructure especially in the rural areas. As of 2012, there
was a total of only 2,112 kilometres of fiber optic cable in the country,
concentrated in urban areas.

The situation described above makes it a

challenge for Malawi to provide electronic services to the general public,
especially to those that reside in rural areas.
ii.

Underdeveloped research and development capacity in ICT.

No patented

ICT-based innovation has been recorded in the country. The country imports
almost all of its ICT products and services.
iii.

Inadequate specialized ICT professionals and institutional capacity. There are
very few certified professionals in specialist ICT areas. Malawi continues to
depend on international experts as well as

institutions for capacity

development and for implementing and managing complex ICT initiatives.
iv.

High investment cost for ICT infrastructure.

ICT infrastructure is heavily

dependent on imported material. Linked to the above challenge, experts for
constructing the infrastructure have to be imported. Return on investment is
low, especially in the rural areas due to the low telephone and computer use
in those areas, and investors shun from investing in the rural areas. This is
evidenced through the inadequate ICT infrastructure in Malawian rural areas.
v.

Lack of local and relevant Internet content and e-services that may be useful
to the rural communities makes it difficult to implement ICT programmes.

vi.

Lack of legal instruments for protection of individuals and societies from
abuse arising from the use of ICT and participation in information society.
Users do not trust online and electronic services in the absence of the law.

vii.

Lack of awareness of ICT and e-services and their potential.

Awareness

programmes on ICT and ICT-based services have not been implemented on a
large scale in Malawi due to a lack of coordination.
viii.

Low levels of online public services and low levels of engaging the citizens
using ICTs.

There has never been a deliberate policy to facilitate the

provision of electronic platforms for citizen engagement in the development

4

process. Public entities, therefore, have not been encouraged to ensure that
their services are available online and electronically.
The above challenges are of huge magnitude and have a negative impact on the
growth of the economy.

In addition, the e-government development index of

2011 ranks Malawi on number 159 out of 190 countries in the World.

Largely responses to the problems have been uncoordinated and far apart. The
following section elaborates the responses to specific problems:


To address the challenge of inadequate ICT infrastructure especially in the
rural

areas,

government

has

established

tele-centres

in

rural

areas.

Government is also implementing a Regional Communication Infrastructure
Program Malawi Project (RCIP-MW) that will implement fiber optic cable
connectivity to Tanzania with very high speed Internet Capacity.


Government is currently reviewing the Communications Act (1998) and
drafting the Electronic Transactions and Management Bill in order to address
the challenges that are affecting the development of ICT in the country.



Government

is

implementing

an

e-Schools

initiative

where

computer

laboratories with internet access are being implemented in public schools.
The development of this policy will, among other things, help Government and
various stakeholders to effectively deal with the above mentioned and any
emerging problems associated with ICT at different levels of society.

1.4. PURPOSE OF THE POLICY
Given the benefits and opportunities offered by ICT, it is acknowledged that
Malawi cannot effectively forge ahead with its development agenda without
putting in place an appropriate framework for ICT to support and accelerate
various initiatives and interventions at all levels of society.

Therefore, this ICT

Policy sets out Malawi’s development agenda in the information age based on the
fundamental principles of the Constitution of the Republic of Malawi as outlined in
Chapter 3. The policy is also based on the Policy Framework Document: “An
Integrated ICT-led Socio-economic Development Policy and Plan Development
Framework for Malawi’’.
5

In this Policy, Government has defined priority areas that will have a huge impact
in the realization of an information society and knowledge-based economy.

As

Malawi implements the policy, the following benefits are expected to be realised:


job creation and foreign currency savings through local production of ICTbased products and services;



higher education status for the country due to the increased access to
education and learning materials at all levels of education;



lower doctor-patient ratios and improved access to medical care and
information;



diversified marketing opportunities and increased income for the country.

Some of the initiatives that will be implemented through this policy include
improvement of ICT infrastructure and connectivity to international internet
routes with increased internet bandwidth. These initiatives are intended to bring
down the cost of communication especially for the internet-based applications and
services.
Through this policy, Government will establish a legal and regulatory framework
to protect consumers of ICT products and services.

3.1. STRATEGIC ICT LEADERSHIP
An analysis of Malawi’s ICT environment currently indicates that there is need to
build and enhance ICT strategic leadership for an integrated and responsive
national ICT programme. The policy aims at establishing strategic ICT leadership
at all levels of society to take the lead in sourcing; creating an attractive
environment for investors and consumers; identifying areas needing priority
funding and support; and obtaining and directing resources.
Objective: To provide sustained high level ICT leadership and championship
oversight, inspiration and political goodwill.
Policy Statement 1: The policy will ensure that Government shall raise the level
of awareness among those in leadership positions on the role, use, application
and potential of ICT.
Policy Statement 2:

The policy will ensure that Government shall raise the

profile of ICT in the society and promote confidence in utilizing ICTs to the
citizens.
3.2. HUMAN CAPITAL DEVELOPMENT
The value of human capital is increased through education, healthcare and
acquisition of skills through training. Currently, there is limited access to health,
education and training services by the majority of Malawians. The integration of
ICT in service delivery within the education and health sectors will facilitate and
accelerate interventions in human capital development.
Objective:

To increase access to healthcare, education and training facilities

through ICT utilization.
Policy Statement 1: The policy will ensure that Government shall integrate ICTs
in the education systems at all levels in order to improve access to and quality of
education; improve management of education systems.

nation’s limited health facilities, improve management of health services and
information dissemination, and enhance medical research.
Policy Statement 3: Government shall develop a large pool of highly skilled ICT
personnel to carry out ICT research and develop ICT innovations within the
country.

3.3. E-GOVERNMENT SERVICES
Electronic government is the utilisation of ICTs in provision of public services. Use
of ICTs enhances accountability and promotes equitable allocation and distribution
of public resources.

ICT plays a crucial role in improving the efficiency of the

operations of the public service; particularly in improving the delivery of quality
service to the general public and the provision of national security.

Malawi is

currently ranked 159 out of 190 countries due to its low utilisation of ICTs for
public service provision.
Policy Statement 1:

Government shall deploy ICTs to facilitate effective and

efficient public service delivery and interaction between the public service and
citizens of Malawi, companies, government institutions, cooperating partners and
other stakeholders of the Government of Malawi;
Policy Statement 2:

Government shall deploy ICTs in order to enhance

oversight functions in Government.

3.4. ICT IN INDUSTRIES
Malawi is currently promoting the production of export-quality products and
services through its local industry sector. However, the country still depends on
imported goods as the local industry is unable to meet even the internal demands.
The ICT industry in Malawi is under-developed. The growth of the ICT industry, if
properly harnessed, will influence the rapid development of all industries in
Malawi.
Policy Statement 1:

The policy shall promote the use of ICT in the private

sector’s service delivery and in research and development of goods and services;

9

Policy Statement 2: Government shall promote local and foreign investment for
innovative production, R&D and diffusion of ICT by the private sector.

The policy will ensure that Government introduces

initiatives to promote the development of a domestic and export-oriented ICT
industry;
Policy Statement 5: Government shall promote the implementation of “Green”
ICT to encourage the use of environmentally-friendly ICT products.

3.5. ICT INFRASTRUCTURE DEVELOPMENT
ICT infrastructure is the base for communication and delivery of electronic
services. ICT infrastructure in Malawi is under-developed, especially in the rural
areas.
Objective : To develop the ICT Infrastructure in order to improve access and
delivery of services as well as reduce communication costs.
Policy Statement 1: Government shall promote ICT infrastructure development
in all areas of the country to provide basic means for electronic communication
and delivery of e-services.

adaptive and robust national ICT backbone infrastructure that feeds into equally
high quality regional and international ICT infrastructure;
Policy Statement 3: Government shall promote and facilitate domestic and
foreign private sector investments in ICT infrastructure development;
Policy Statement 4: Government shall encourage sharing and co-location of ICT
infrastructure and ICT facilities by service providers.

10

3.6. ICT IN THE PRIORITY GROWTH SECTORS
The growth sectors of MGDS include Agriculture, Tourism and Mining. There is
potential for ICT to stimulate, modernise and sustain processes and systems in
agriculture, tourism and mining sectors.
Policy Statement 1: Government shall encourage the utilisation of ICTs in agrobusiness industry;

agricultural extension services; research in agricultural

production and processing.
Policy Statement 2: Government shall encourage the utilisation of ICTs to
ensure that Malawi’s presence as a unique and attractive tourist destination is
recognized on the global map through the provision of up-to-date tourism
information;
Policy Statement 3: Government shall ensure that ICTs are used to strengthen
sustainable natural resource and environmental management practices; Provide
access to geographical information on natural resources and wildlife habitats and
exact location and quantities of minerals;
Policy Statement 4: Government shall encourage the use of ICT to explore
marketing opportunities for Malawi’s products including exportable natural
resources products;
Policy Statement 5: Government shall promote the utilisation of ICTs in
environmental protection.

3.7. RESPONSIVE ICT LEGAL, REGULATORY AND INSTITUTIONAL
FRAMEWORK
The ICT Sector is a very dynamic sector that requires regular updates in
legislations and regulations.

Currently, Malawi’s Communications sector is

regulated by the Communications Act 1998, which only focuses on postal,
broadcasting and telecommunications.
Policy Statement 1: The policy will ensure that Government develops and
harmonises legal instruments to ensure that the ICT industry is regulated to
safeguard human rights, facilitate fair competition within the industry and
promote accountability to the public.
11

Policy Statement 2: The policy will ensure that Government develops laws and
institutional framework to govern the use of electronic evidence, and to
coordinate development and utilisation of ICTs in Malawi.
3.8. PROMOTING NATIONAL SECURITY
Globalization and pervasiveness of crime and other security challenges have
brought perverse tendencies which are threats to national security. Malawi needs
to establish adequate capacity to deal with national security, violation of human
rights, undesirable impacts of ICTs including the violation of privacy, spread of
undesirable materials, cyber-crimes, digital frauds and terrorism. Surveillance and
readiness of security agencies require the use of specialized skills and ICTs.
Policy Statement 1: Government shall create statutory obligations for ICT

service providers to address security needs of the country.
Policy Statement 2:

Government shall enhance the capacity of security

agencies to be up to date with developments in the ICT sector, including
cyber crimes.
Policy Statement 3: Government shall use ICTs to provide early warnings to
mitigate risks and impact of disasters and facilitate relief management.
Policy Statement 4:

Government shall promote the use of ICTs to mitigate

crimes and enhance public security.
Policy Statement 5:

Government shall establish mechanisms for cooperation

with international security agencies to combat cross-border crimes.

3.9. INTERNATIONAL COOPERATION
ICT is the key element in the globalisation process. Countries cannot operate in
isolation and close cooperation between different countries is of great importance.
In accordance with the existing foreign policy, the Government of Malawi will
therefore, consolidate the existing regional and international relationships in the
ICT sector and establish new ones where they do not exist.
Policy Statement 1:

Government shall ensure that Malawi is a major and

regular player in the regional and international ICT committees and increase the
level of participation in regional and international ICT fora.
12

Policy Statement 2: Government shall ensure that Malawi adheres to the ICT
standards as enlisted in international and regional agreements to which it is a
signatory.

3.10. UNIVERSAL ACCESS OF ICT AND ICT RELATED SERVICES.
The majority of Malawians live in rural and underserved areas. These areas do
not have adequate access to ICT services due to poor or no network coverage,
insufficient access to public pay phones as well as personal phones, very limited
availability of postal and Internet services, limited TV coverage, and lack of
relevant Internet content that may be useful to them. One of the fundamental
principles of the Constitution of the Republic of Malawi is to enhance the quality of
life in rural communities and to recognize rural standards of living.
Policy Statement 1: Government shall ensure that all people in every part of
the country have access to affordable, reliable and efficient essential ICT services
in their community by 2016.
Policy

Statement

2:

Government

shall

promote

the

development

and

implementation of initiatives for the creation and development of electronic local
content that will inform, educate and entertain the public.
Policy Statement 3:

Government shall ensure the provision of financial

incentives to ICT service providers for expansion of infrastructure and services to
areas that are not economically viable and ensure that services are viable and
sustainable in the long term;
Policy

Statement

4:

Government

shall

facilitate

the

deployment

and

exploitation of ICTs in the promotion of diversification and improvement of the
quality of information; increasing accessibility to ranges of information resources
within and outside the country and creating a supportive environment for the
development of the mass media and the private press in the information age;
Policy Statement 5: Government, in coordination with Non-governmental
organizations and development partners, shall mobilize financial resources for
implementation of ICT programmes for women and the youth;
Policy Statement 6: Government shall encourage and promote the development
of special ICT services for the disadvantaged communities and the disabled;
13

Policy Statement 7: Government, in coordination with Non-governmental
organizations and development partners develop capacities targeted at special
groups of people in society to ensure that ICT initiatives are all-inclusive;
Policy Statement 8: Government shall encourage development partners, nongovernment organizations, as well as the private sector's participation to facilitate
the roll-out of community-based ICT initiatives.
