Introduction

1.1

Overview
This document is the National Information Security Policy. The policy outlines the
mandatory minimum security controls that all public and private sector
organisations that use, own and/or operate protected computers, handle official
communications and personal data must apply to reduce their vulnerability to
cyber threats. The use of the security measures mandated by this policy would
increase the capacity of organisations to endure and recover from cyber attacks.

1.2

Applicability of National Information Security
Policy
As noted above, this policy is mandatory for all public and private sector
organisations that use, own and/or operate protected computers, handle official
communications and personal data. In accordance with the Computer Misuse
Act 2011, the term “protected computers” refers to computers used directly in
connection with or necessary for Uganda’s security, defence, diplomacy; law
enforcement; communications infrastructure, banking and financial services,
public utilities; public key infrastructure and public safety. In this policy, “official
communications” encompass information that Ministries, Departments, Agencies
and Local Governments (MDALs) create and process during their day-to-day
business activities. Official communications have lower security sensitivity than
data handled by protected computers. However, the loss, theft and unauthorised
disclosure of “official communications” could have negative consequences on
the MDALs. Lastly, “personal data” covers data that relates to an individual.

1.2.1

Critical Infrastructure (CI)
In this policy, “critical infrastructure” is the collective term for all systems used
directly in connection with or necessary for protected computer activities, the
handling of official communications and personal data. This policy adopts the
International Telecommunication Union (ITU)’s definition of critical infrastructure
(CI). Hence, in this policy, CI comprises of “key systems, services and functions
whose disruption or destruction would have a debilitating impact on public health
and safety, commerce, and national security, or any combination of these.”
According to the ITU, CI encompasses physical elements such as facilities,
buildings and equipment and virtual elements such as systems and data. The
ITU further observes that the physical and virtual elements of the infrastructure
include human aspects such as the protection of personnel and the mitigation of
the insider threat. This policy addresses all aspects of the ITU definition of CI
because it covers governance, information, personnel and physical security.

UNCLASSIFIED

1.2.2

Critical Information Infrastructure (CII)
The ITU regards Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) as the virtual element of
critical infrastructure. The information and communication technologies (ICTs),
that form CII, increasingly operate and control critical national sectors such as
health, water, transport, communications, government, energy, food, finance and
emergency services; their physical assets and the activities of personnel.

1.3

Policy Review Cycle
NITA-U shall review this policy, at least annually, to help ensure that it maintains
relevance to business needs, cyber threats and approaches for countering them.

1.4

Structure of National Information Security Policy
The National Information Security Framework (NISF) comprises of five tiers or
levels. This policy is at tier three. The policy presents a set of mandatory
minimum-security requirements under four headings or parts, which are:

1.5



Security governance;



Information security;



Personnel security; and



Physical security

Adaptation of Security Controls
It is important to stress that the mandated minimum requirements contained in
this policy define baseline security controls only. In reality, organisations would
have to do more than merely apply the basic security controls. As a result,
organisations must adapt the security controls provided for by this policy to their
circumstances. Adaptation is inevitable because critical infrastructures reside in
many sectors broadly grouped into health and safety, commerce and national
security. Therefore, organisations acting through their Boards, must determine
the additional security controls that they must apply to mitigate, to acceptable
levels, the cyber threats relevant to their business activities. Boards must reach
decisions on the level of security controls appropriate for their organisations by
considering their own articulated Risk Appetite, business needs and the value,
sensitivity and criticality of the information assets under consideration.

1.6

Policy Context
The Government of Uganda (GoU) regards information security as an enabler of
the efficient, effective, safe and secure delivery of public services. Information
security also serves national security goals by protecting CII that operate and
control the above-mentioned critical national sectors and their physical assets.

2.1

National Information Security Strategy
The National Information Security Strategy (NISS) described the security risks of
technological advance and the risk mitigation measures of such advancement.
The NISS recommended the creation of the Directorate of Information Security
(DIS) in accordance with the National Information Technology Authority, Uganda
(NITA-U) Act, 2009. The DIS, which authored this policy, oversees and promotes
information security governance, risk remediation planning and response. The
NISS also recommended the creation of a National Information Security Advisory
8

UNCLASSIFIED

Group (NISAG) to advise the GoU on information security governance matters.
The NISS further mandated the creation of a National Computer Emergency
Response Team (CERT) under NITA-U.

3

Guiding Principles
The guiding principles below influence actions and decisions within this policy.

3.1

Top Leadership Accountability
The first principle is that the most senior person in the organisation must assume
ultimate accountability for information security. Cabinet Ministers should ensure
that MDALs report on their information risk position at least annually.

3.2

Collective Responsibility
The principle requires all individuals to accept a collective duty to contribute to
efforts to ensure that critical infrastructure assets and services obtain protection
commensurate with their value, sensitive and criticality to their organisations.

3.3

Personal Accountability
Individuals must understand and accept personal accountability for safeguarding
the assets entrusted to them and expect to answer for and/or face sanctions for
breaching security rules.

3.4

Risk Management/Proportionality
Organisations must adapt security controls to their circumstances in particular
their business needs, risk appetite, value and sensitivity of their information.

3.5

Secure/Assured Sharing
This principle requires organisations to apply suitable security controls to enable
the secure sharing of information regardless of its form and method of transfer.

3.6

Suitable, Trustworthy and Reliable Staff
Organisations must only hire staff after verifying that their character and personal
circumstances are such that they can be trusted with access to vital IT assets.
9

UNCLASSIFIED

3.7

Resilience
This principle requires organisations to build capacity to withstand and recover
from cyber attacks and disruptions in a timely manner with minimal damage.

I.
Security Governance

4

Security Governance

4.1

Introduction
Security governance focuses on all the activities required to manage a functional
area namely information, personnel and physical security. This policy adopts the
US ISO/IEC 27001 Plan-Do-Check-Act (PDCA) continuous improvement model
to structure all security governance processes as illustrated below.

Figure 1 – Security Governance and the PDCA Model

Governance aims to ensure that security programmes support business goals.
Thus, mandatory minimum security governance requirements are as follows:

UNCLASSIFIED

4.2

Policy Statement on Information Security
Boards are supreme governing bodies that provide GoU and private sector
organisations guidance on overall policy direction and strategies. Boards also
facilitate, supervise and support management in the implementation of their
mandate and strategies. Given that Boards must consider all the major risks
affecting their organisations, it is crucial that they issue a policy statement on
information security. The purpose of the Board statement is to underline the
importance of information risk management to effective and secure operations.

GV1 – All Boards of organisations with critical infrastructure must issue a
Policy Statement on Information Security. As a minimum requirement, the
Statement must: (a) recognise information as a vital business asset; (b)
acknowledge information risk management as a business enabler and an
integral part of good corporate governance; (c) contain the Board’s
acceptance of ultimate accountability for information risk management; (d) set
clear direction on information risk management by determining Risk Appetite;
and, (e) assign management and employees security responsibilities..

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must:

4.2.1

Issue Policy Statement on Information Security
The policy statement on information security:

4.2.2



Recognises information – in all its forms – as a crucial business asset;



Explains why information security matters and outline policy objectives;



Is a Board commitment to protect organisational information from all threats
– internal or external, deliberate or accidental;



Assigns Accounting Officer accountability for information security; and



Requires all employees (including contractors) to comply with the Statement.

Articulate Information Risk Appetite
Boards must articulate organisational information Risk Appetite. A statement of
information Risk Appetite states the level and type of information risks that a
given organisation is willing to accept, tolerate or survive in the pursuit of its
strategic goals. The statement must:


Explicitly note the Board’s Risk Appetite in relation to information risk;



Map the Risk Appetite on a spectrum e.g. low to very high; averse to hungry;



Address information risk’s relationship with corporate goals in the same way
as other risks e.g. legal, financial, operational, compliance and reputational;
13

UNCLASSIFIED

4.3



Require that all project proposals and plans to demonstrate consistency with
the Board articulated information Risk Appetite;



Be read and understood in conjunction with the risk management strategy;



Assign monitoring responsibility usually to the Audit Committee; and



Be reviewed, debated and agreed at least annually.

Information Security Organisation
Organisations must have an effective organisation to manage its information
security activities. The Accounting Officer must establish such an organisation
with a view of achieving the mandatory minimum-security outcomes below.

GV2 – All organisations with critical infrastructure must establish suitable
information security management arrangements with clearly defined
accountability at all levels. As a minimum requirement: (a) The Accounting
Officer must accept personal accountability for embedding information risk
management into the Internal Control system; (b) a senior executive must
assume overall responsibility for information risk management at Board level;
(c) organisation must establish a senior management committee to
coordinate information risk management; (d) heads of business divisions
must assume responsibility for named information assets; (e) every system
must have a single responsible officer; and, (f) organisations must appoint
trained staff to security roles.

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must:


Set up an Information Security Management System (ISMS) in accordance
with US ISO/IEC 27001:2005. The organisation shall also adopt the "PlanDo-Check-Act" (PDCA) model to structure all ISMS processes; and



Create an information security organisation that is fully compliant with the
requirements of US ISO/IEC 27001:2005.

As a minimum requirement, organisations should distribute roles as follows:

4.3.1

Responsibilities of Boards & Accounting Officers
The information security organisation must perform the roles below at Boardlevel:


Treat information risk as a corporate-level risk;



Review the information risk position at least quarterly; and



Explicitly address information risk management in Annual Reports.

14

UNCLASSIFIED

4.3.2

Responsibilities of Information Risk Owner
The security organisation shall appoint a Board-level official to the role of
Information Risk Owner (IRO) with responsibilities including:

4.3.2.1



Ownership of a plan to foster a culture of information security;



Accountability for the organisational risk management policy;



Alignment of the risk management programme with business processes;  



Advising on information risk sections of the Statement on Internal Control; 



Ensuring that all assets have skilled and empowered owners; and



The production of quarterly and annual information risk assessments.

Choice of Information Risk Owner
It is important to stress that the IRO is a role not necessarily a job title. As such,
organisations could appoint anyone with adequate standing and expertise to this
role. However, guided by the Presidential Directive to create a programme to
professionalise information security, the Chief Information Security Officer
(CISO) or a similar title must be the first choice for the Board-level IRO role.
Choosing a CISO for the IRO role would help ensure that the Board receives
timely and effective advice about the impacts of their strategic and operational
decisions on information security. Organisations may appoint an interim IRO
during the hiring and/or training of a CISO or similar title to take over the role.

4.3.3

Responsibilities of Information Asset Owners
Information asset owners must be heads of division or department and perform
the following functions:

4.3.4



Understand and support the organisation’s security culture;



Know what information the assets under their responsibility hold;



Know who accesses the assets under their responsibility and why; 



Identify and mitigate risks to the assets under their responsibility;



Ensure that assets under their responsibility are available for business use;



Provide the Board-level Information Risk Owner reasonable assurance that
the assets under their responsibility are secure at least annually.

Responsibilities of Security Coordination Group
Led by Board-level Information Risk Owner, the information security coordinators
must perform the following functions:


Ensure that effective information risk management processes are in place;

15

UNCLASSIFIED

4.3.5



Approve organisational security policies and standards; 



Monitor compliance with agreed security policies and standards; and



Encourage the professionalisation of all security areas.

Responsibilities of Operational Security team
Led by chief information security officer or similar role, the operational security
team must perform the following functions:

4.4



Implement the organisation’s information risk policy;



Follow approved security policies and standards;



Enforce security requirements on all stakeholders including suppliers; and 



Identify and report non-compliance with security policies and rules.

Risk Management
Risk management activities must show that the Board and Accounting Officer,
acting with and through the Board-level Information Risk Owner, are complying
with the mandatory minimum-security requirements below on mitigating risks to
acceptable levels.

GV3 – All organisations with critical infrastructure must adopt a formal,
consistent and policy-guided risk management approach to help ensure the
security of critical infrastructure. Drawing on the guidance within the NISF, all
organisations must: (a) have a suitable information risk policy to address threat
sources and actors; (b) prioritise risks; and, (c) manage information risks during
the ICT system's development, acceptance, operational and decommissioning
and disposal phases.

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must:


Use the Board-issued information Risk Appetite as a guide for routine risk
management decisions to ensure that the organisation avoids taking either
too much or too little risk in pursuit of its business goals;



Identify business critical assets and the impact of their compromise or loss;



Have in place a Risk Register to record and audit risk management decisions
by identifying risk owners, residual risk and risk treatment actions; and



Comply with NISF guidance contained in the Security Standard No.1 –
Technical Risk Assessment (SS1) and Security Standard No.2 – Risk
Management and Accreditation (SS2).

16

UNCLASSIFIED

4.5

Awareness, Education and Training
The purpose of awareness, education and training is to foster an organisational
culture that values, protects and handles information assets safely and thereby
achieves the mandatory minimum-security outcomes outlined below.

GV4 – Organisations must ensure that all users – including Ministers, Board
members, senior executives, employees and third party users – obtain
security awareness before gaining access to critical infrastructure. As a
minimum requirement, the awareness must: (a) as part of the induction
process, explain to staff the security risks associated with their work; (b) help
staff gain awareness of the organisation’s security policies; (c) remind staff of
their personal responsibility for safeguarding assets entrusted to them; (d)
articulate potential penalties for breaching security rules; (e) be assessed
formally; and; (f) be repeated at least annually.

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must:

4.6



Conduct security induction training for all employees, including contractors
and subcontractors, to ensure that they are conversant with organisational
security policies and procedures as well their personal accountability for
securing assets under their control and/or supervision;



Allocate sufficient resources to finance a sustained user security awareness
and education programme covering relevant risks, threats and vulnerabilities;
acceptable usage; impacts of cyber attacks; incident response actions and
the personal consequences of breaching security rules;



Avail security policies to all staff, including contractors, internally;



Ensure that all staff, including contractors, obtain appropriate briefings about
how legislation identified in this policy, in particular, the Official Secrets, the
Access to Information, the Computer Misuse, the Electronic Signatures and
the Electronic Transactions Acts affect their work activities;



Provide security cleared staff training matching their access privileges;



Ensure that staff performing security roles receive suitable training; and



Regularly review and re-evaluate the effectiveness of security awareness
and education activities in light of a changing threat environment.

Business Continuity & Disaster Recovery
Business continuity activities aim to show that the organisation has the capacity
to withstand interruptions to critical business activities and thereby achieve the
mandatory minimum-security outcomes outlined below.

17

UNCLASSIFIED

GV5 – All organisations must implement appropriate business continuity (BC)
and disaster recovery (DR) programmes to minimise the impact of and
ensure the timely recovery from interruptions that may result from natural
disasters, accidents, equipment failures and deliberate actions. As a
minimum requirement, organisations must have in place: (a) a BC
management strategy that takes a long-term view of organisational continuity
needs; (b) a policy outlining management direction and support for business
continuity; (c) BC and DR plans for all locations; and, (d) systematic BC/DR
testing, reporting and maintenance procedures for all critical infrastructure.

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must:

4.7



Address information security needs of organisational business continuity;



Establish the criticality of different facilities, systems, sites and networks by
performing a business impact analysis of the unavailability of each asset;



Identify and assess the probability and the information security impacts of
events that could cause interruptions to business operations e.g. fire, theft;



Adopt a common business continuity planning framework to ensure that all
plans address information security requirements consistently;

likelihood and impact of security incidents and ensuring the quick resumption of
business activities in line with the mandatory minimum-security outcomes below.

GV6 – All organisations with critical infrastructure must have a formal security
incident management process to enable the accurate and timely
identification, communication, investigation and response to security events
and weaknesses. As a minimum requirement, the process must: (a) formally
establish management’s accountability for incident management; (b) define
roles and responsibilities; (c) include tested policies, plans and procedures;
(d) ensure staff obtain specialist incident response training; (e) promote an
incident reporting culture; and, (f) quantify, monitor and learn from incidents.

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must:
18

UNCLASSIFIED



Put in place effective mechanisms for quantifying and monitoring the types,
volumes and costs of information security incidents;



Adopt procedures for reporting security incidents to GoU agencies such as
the national Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT); and



Ensure that the collection, retention and presentation of data about security
incidents comply with relevant rules of evidence to enable follow-up action.

Assurance & Compliance
Assurance and compliance reporting aims to demonstrate that the organisation
is achieving the mandatory minimum-security outcomes outlined below.

GV7 – Organisations must provide reasonable assurance that their security
arrangements mitigate risks to critical infrastructure adequately. Using a
range of compliance mechanisms, organisations must, as a minimum

Information Security

5.1

Introduction
Information and the supporting processes, systems and networks that process,
store, retrieve, and transmit it, play a vital role in the conduct and success of
GoU and private sector operations. Therefore, organisations must protect the
information they handle internally and that they share with external partners.
Assuring the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information is necessarily
a corporate-level concern because security incidents threaten organisational
reputations, legal positions and the ability to conduct business operations.

5.1.1

GoU information security commitment
The GoU is committed to:

5.1.2



Achieving high standards of Information Security governance;



Treating information security as a critical business issue and creating a
security-conscious environment;



Demonstrating to third parties that it deals with information security in a
proactive manner; and



Applying the guiding principles outlined in section 3 such as implementing
controls that are proportionate to risk.

Applicability of information security requirements
Uganda is determined to thwart internal and external threat actors seeking to
breach the security of information assets within the country. Therefore, the
information security mandatory minimum-security requirements apply to:
i.

All staff in organisations with critical infrastructure including public and
civil servants, contractors, consultants, temporary employees, guests and
volunteers. The requirements also apply to third parties that access and
use of information that critical infrastructures handle;

ii.

All types of information i.e. written, printed on paper, stored electronically
or optically, transmitted by courier or using electronic means, recorded on

access information assets and the activities they perform with the assets.

5.1.3

Information Security and Security Governance
The themes contained in “Part 1 – Security Governance” apply to the information
security functional area in the same way as personnel and physical security. For
example, the information security area must have effective leadership; adopt a
credible risk management approach; conduct effective security awareness,
education and training; handle security incidents and institute assurance and
compliance reporting mechanisms. Moreover, the information security functional
area adopts the PDCA continuous improvement model to all processes. The
mandatory minimum information security requirements are as follows:

5.2

Information Security Policy
An information security policy helps improve security if published, enforced,
audited and updated to reflect organisational requirements. A security policy
aims to achieve the following mandated minimum-security requirements:

IS1 – Management must draft, obtain Board-approval and publish an
information security policy that addresses the NISF mandatory minimum
requirements in terms of the organisation’s business requirements, threat
environment and risk appetite. As a minimum requirement, the policy must: (a)
explain how the organisation and supply chain protect information and physical
assets; (b) apply to all the activities linked to protect computers; (c) define
acceptance and compliance arrangements by its staff and the supply chain; (d)
undergo regular review to ensure its continuing relevance.
To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, the policy must:


Define the purpose, scope and approach to managing information security
within the organisation;



Identify and assign suitable security roles and responsibilities depending on
the size, structure, business needs and threats to the organisation;



Require the creation of a manual guiding the implementation of an ISMS in
compliance with US ISO/IEC 27001;



Specify a review cycle in order to ensure its continued applicability.

Asset Management
Organisations must achieve and maintain appropriate protection for information
assets in compliance with US ISO/IEC 27001:2005. Effective asset management
helps achieve the mandated NISF minimum security outcomes outlined below.

IS2 – All organisations must ensure that assets associated with critical
infrastructure receive the level of protection appropriate to their value,
sensitivity and criticality. As a minimum requirement, all organisations must: (a)
use approved criteria to create a definitive register of business critical facilities,
systems, sites and networks; (b) designate a suitably empowered owner for
every asset; (c) use the Government Security Classification Standard to
determine the acceptable procedures for labelling, handling, transmitting and
decommissioning assets; (d) audit the asset register regularly; and; (e) inform
the Board of the main security risks affecting vital business assets.

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must:


Conduct an inventory of their assets drawing up and maintaining a register of
important assets as a prerequisite to risk management;



Ensure that designated divisions own and secure named information assets;



Identify, document and enforce rules of acceptable use of information assets;

5.4

Secure Information Sharing
Secure information sharing is about ascertaining that exchange partners have in
place security controls that achieve the minimum-security outcomes below.

IS3 – All organisations, particularly those within and/or connecting to
Government, must require internal and external entities to show compliance
with mandated NISF requirements and approved security policies before
sharing or allowing connections to protected computer assets. As a minimum
requirement, organisations must: (a) identify and record risks involving external
parties; (b) create information exchange policies and procedures; (c) use
formal exchange agreements such as codes of connection and memoranda of
understanding; (d) assess compliance of exchange partners at least annually
or when required; and, (e) disconnect/end sharing with non-compliant entities.

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must:


Ensure that users are fully conversant and comply with approved information
exchange policies, procedures, controls and relevant national legislation;



Use cryptographic solutions to provide users and applications the underlying
“trust” to operate authentication, integrity, confidentiality and non-repudiation
security services to protect collaborative tools and information exchanges;



Establish exchange agreements that require parties seeking access to GoU
and other critical infrastructure to have in place security measures that match
the security classification and handling requirements for the asset;



Ascertain that exchange agreements with external parties are enforceable;

5.5

Supply Chain Security
All organisations increasingly source ICT systems and software from a global
network of suppliers, distributors and business partners. The advantages of a
global ICT supply chain including competitive prices, innovative products and
flexibility. Regrettably, there is clear evidence that global ICT supply chains have
heightened system and software risks. Thus, supply chain security measures
aim to help achieve the mandated minimum-security outcomes below.

IS4 – All organisations must mitigate risks of intentional and unintentional
supply chain compromise. As a minimum requirement, organisations must: (a)
establish consistent supply chain security processes with clear lines of
accountability; (b) ensure that suppliers are subject to and pass a national
security impact assessment; (c) include security clauses in service contracts;
(d) ensure that the computer networks, products and services supplied do not
introduce information security risks; (e) assess compliance with requirements
at least annually; and, (f) enforce sanctions for non-compliance.

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must:


Identify and evaluate the security risks related to outsourcing or offshoring
before letting contracts for critical infrastructure and services;



Recognise that they retain accountability for managing their information risks
even where they outsource ICT systems and services to third parties;



5.6

Access Management
Access management focuses on how to control who gains access to critical
infrastructure. At its simplest, access management or control aims to ensure that
only business and security requirements determine who accesses information,
information processing facilities and business processes. Consequently, access
control aims to achieve the minimum-security outcomes below.

IS5 – Organisations must ensure that only users, processes and devices with a
business need and suitable security clearances gain access to critical
infrastructure. As a minimum requirement, access management must: (a)
follow a formal access control policy linked to HR processes; (b) use formal
access registration and revocation processes; (c) require appropriate
identification and authentication techniques for all IT systems; (d) enable
organisations to deter, detect, resist and defend against accidental or
deliberate unauthorised actions; and, (e) enable regular review of access
rights.

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must:


Define and document business requirements for access control and restrict
access to critical infrastructure to those who satisfy these requirements;



Adopt an access control policy that enforces the principle of least privilege;



Restrict and control the allocation and use of privileges in accordance with
the Need-to-Know principle;



Select and apply a suitable access control model amongst Discretionary,
Role Based and Mandatory Access Control;



Apply the principle of uniform access management i.e. use of authentication
and authorisation services to control resource use;



Have in place a formal process for user password management;



Ensure that users are aware of and abide by their responsibilities to maintain
access controls such as passwords;



Enforce recommendations of access rights reviews e.g. disable users; and



Harden and lockdown user applications such as web browsers and office
productivity applications to reduce exposure to software vulnerabilities.

27

UNCLASSIFIED

5.7

Network Security Controls
Proportionate risk-based technical security controls can help achieve the
mandated NISF minimum-security outcomes outlined below.

IS6 – All organisations must apply technical security controls appropriate to the
protected computer’s value, sensitivity and criticality. As a minimum
requirement, the controls must include: (a) a formally documented security
architecture providing end-to-end network security; (b) the segregation of
networks handling information of different business impact levels; (c) the
enforcement of service minimisation; (d) the use of unified authentication and
authorisation services; (e) the matching of security levels with information
protection needs; and, (f) the adoption of the defence-in-depth principle.

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must:


Adopt a security architecture that provides end-to-end network security by
enabling the detection, identification and correction of security vulnerabilities;



Ensure that users only gain access to network services e.g. web browsing
and file upload if they have a legitimate business reason for the access;



Enforce sufficient segregation, zoning or variable depth security to separate
specific areas of the network, groups of information services and information
systems handling data of different security classification levels;



Implement boundary protection measures for shared networks, especially
those extending across organisational boundaries, in compliance with the
access control policy and requirements of the business applications;



Enforce network routing controls to ensure that connections and information
flows do not breach the access control policy of the business applications;



Apply the principle of service minimisation consistently across the network by
disabling services that do not satisfy business and security needs for access;



Adopt solutions that use techniques such as encryption to offer converged
voice, data and video packets protection appropriate to their security needs;



Adopt the “defence in depth” or “layered‟ approach to network security
through the use of different technical security controls and security products
to mitigate security threats collectively; and



In accordance with ISO/IEC 18043, install network intrusion detection (NIDS)
and network intrusion protection (NIPS) devices to monitor network traffic for
unusual or suspicious activity and prevent cyber attacks; and



Build survivability into networks to ensure that technical solutions continue to
deliver a minimum set of essential functionality in a timely manner even if
parts of the network are unreachable or have failed due to an attack.

5.8

Malicious Code Protection
Malicious code such as such as viruses, worms, spyware and Trojan Horses are
popular attack vectors for a range of threat actors seeking to gain unauthorised
access to sensitive ICT systems and the information they store and handle. The
threat actors use e-mail attachments, infected websites, instant messages, chat
rooms and social media to trick users into clicking on infected links. Malicious
code exploits vulnerabilities in ICT hardware and applications to breach security.
Therefore, understanding malicious code risks and applying appropriate security
countermeasures can achieve the mandated minimum-security outcomes below.

IS7 – All organisations with critical infrastructure must apply appropriate
controls against malicious code. As a minimum requirement, the organisations
must: (a) assess the risk of malicious code; (b) adopt a malicious code policy
that considers their business needs and threat environment; (c) deploy suitable
malicious code detection mechanisms; (d) educate users about malicious code
risks; (e) ensure that authorised mobile code complies with security policy; and
(f) address published technical vulnerabilities in a timely manner.

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must:


Mandate that all users, regardless of location, abide by a malicious code
policy that should, amongst other issues, require the installation of anti-virus
or anti-malware software on all devices; update of anti-virus or anti-malware
software signatures; system scanning; secure file attachment handling;
secure file sharing; removable media scans; virus log generation and review;



Identify and block all direct e.g. e-mail attachments, social media, malicious
websites and indirect e.g. unauthorised personal laptops, PDA, USB,
CD/DVD routes that threat actors could use to inject malicious code;



Ensure that network boundary devices have the capacity to check inbound
and outbound content for malicious code such as viruses, worms and Trojan
horses and mobile code such as Java, JavaScript, ActiveX, or any other
executable code with potential to damage networks, applications, and data;



Use measures such as logically segregated environments (i.e. sandboxes)
and application-specific controls to manage the execution of mobile code;



Install host-based software to scan, clean, quarantine and raise alerts about
suspicious files, including malicious websites, prior to access;



Provide users suitable security awareness and education about the impacts,
preventative measures and actions against malicious code attacks;



Routinely patch ICT systems, security enforcing products and applications
against known vulnerabilities to reduce exposure to malicious code;



Conduct regular vulnerability assessments to identify potential weaknesses
that could enable the introduction of malicious code;



Build adequate capacity to identify, deter, resist and defend against known
and unknown (zero-day) malicious code attacks; and

29

UNCLASSIFIED



5.9

Have in place effective and current contingency, recovery, investigatory and
reporting procedures to enable timely response to malicious code attacks.

Portable and Removable Media Security
Portable and removable media devices increase workplace productivity by
enabling access to corporate network resources anytime, anywhere. Therefore,
the devices are a popular way of gaining access to corporate network resources.
Apart from devices that organisations that organisations supply, IT departments
face pressures to accept the trend of bring your own device (BYOD) where staff
seeks to use personally owned devices at work. However, the portable devices
expose sensitive information assets to security risks greater than one would
expect in office environments usually due to the lack of physical security
measures. Thus, portable and removable media security aims to achieve the
outcomes below by balancing the benefits and risks of mobile devices.

IS8 – All organisations using portable and removable media must adopt formal
procedures to prevent the unauthorised disclosure, modification, removal or
destruction of assets, and interruption to business activities. As a minimum
requirement, organisations must: (a) perform a formal risk/benefit analysis
before use of the media; (b) as part of a formal policy, require authorisation to
use and transfer the media; (c) use baseline builds that, by default, lock down
access to media drives; (d) encrypt devices to deter unauthorised access; (e)
enforce security policy on media to detect and resist unauthorised use; (f)
conduct user awareness training; (g) audit user actions; and, (h) prevent the
holding, storage and processing of sensitive information on personal devices.

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must:


Lock down host devices to stop users changing default configurations and
thereby enabling malicious actors to execute privileged commands;



Use full disk hardware encryption for devices processing sensitive data;



Ensure that users understand that maintaining physical custody of the device
is the best form of defence;



Not allow the use of privately owned devices to process, store or remotely
access critical infrastructure, programs and data except in emergency, shortterm situations where it is not practical to issue official equipment;



Define procedures for the timely termination of emergency use of privately
owned devices to process, store or remotely access critical infrastructure;



Prevent devices that do not comply with organisational policy, such as the
use of hardened configurations, from connecting to the corporate network;



Give users appropriate training in the handling of authentication credentials
such as encryption keys, hardware tokens, smartcards and passwords;

30

UNCLASSIFIED

5.10



Defend against random and targeted attacks by requiring users to power off
devices when not in use; never to leave devices unattended; requiring that
users store devices separately from credentials, amongst other measures;



Minimise data aggregation risks by ensuring that user devices only store
data required to perform approved business activities at any given time;



Adopt anti-virus or anti-malware procedures including stand-alone systems
(i.e. ‘sheep dips’) to scan portable and removable media for malicious code
before their use for data import and export; and



Make sure that users are conversant with mobile device incident response
and reporting procedures such as when to report device loss to the Police.

Remote Access Security
Remotely connecting a computer either to another computer or to a network over
public networks such as the Internet increases staff flexibility and productivity.
Staff with remote access can perform general work activities, access e-mail and
transfer files. However, remote access presents unique security challenges to
organisations. Firstly, remote access calls for additional security measures given
that it occurs over insecure public networks. Secondly, because remote access
occurs in exposed environments such as homes or when travelling, it increases
exposure to risks such as theft of equipment and information, the unauthorised
disclosure of information, unauthorised remote access to internal systems or
misuse of facilities. Therefore, in accordance with ISO/IEC 27002, organisations
must not authorise remote access or teleworking unless satisfied that suitable
security arrangements and controls are in place and that the measures comply
with relevant information security policies. Good remote access security can help
achieve the following mandated information security outcomes.

IS9 – All organisations must implement appropriate security measures to
mitigate remote access risks. As a minimum requirement, organisations must:
(a) adopt a formal remote access policy; (b) assess the risks, threats and
vulnerabilities of remote access; (c) use security controls e.g. encryption to
protect data whilst at rest and in transit; (d) educate users about remote access
risks; (e) security accredit remote access solution handling classified data; and,
(e) align remote access policy with incident management plans.

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must:


Adopt a formal remote access policy that defines roles and responsibilities
for management, users, administrators and security personnel guided by
business needs, conditions, threats and the impacts of security breaches;



Demonstrate that adequate authentication, access control, communication
and availability measures are in place to reduce the risks of unauthorised
access, disruption and modification of remote access solution servers, clients
and applications in accordance with ISO/IEC 18028-4;

31

UNCLASSIFIED



Enforce a remote access policy requirement that users and devices only gain
access to network services for which they authorisation for;



Grant remote access only for as long as is necessary for business purposes;



content that they process against eavesdropping;



Encrypt remote access clients to make them inaccessible if lost or stolen;



Ensure that users accept and comply with the Security Operating Procedures
(SyOPs) for mobile devices such as powering off devices when not in use;



Ensure that users know and accept their personal accountability for guarding
remote access devices against threats and risks in insecure environments
such as snatching, shoulder-surfing, eavesdropping etc;



Provide remote access servers satisfactory security including protection
against unauthorised physical access; assured power supply; secure set-up,
configuration and administration; back-up and recovery procedures;



Present a formal risk assessment and obtain approval from relevant security
agencies before permitting the remote administration of critical infrastructure,
programs and data from overseas locations given the risk posed by threat
actors and sources such as foreign intelligence services to such access;



Ensure that remote access solutions, including contracts with IT suppliers,
comply with applicable legislative or regulatory constraints in particular the
Official Secrets Act, 1964 and the Access to Information Act, 2005 regarding
the handling of information, which is likely to prejudice the security of the
State or interfere with the right to the privacy of any other person;



Submit remote access solutions to a formal security accreditation process to
provide assurance about the adequacy of information security measures e.g.
baseline builds; personnel and physical security controls in the context of the
unique threats, vulnerabilities and risks such solutions face; and



Sanitise and dispose of remote access devices in accordance with the NISF
Secure Equipment Disposal and Re-Use requirements.

Protective Monitoring
Protective monitoring comprises of technical and procedural measures geared at
detecting and stopping attempts to exploit information system vulnerabilities.
Organisations should take a risk-based approach to selecting the level of
protective monitoring undertaken. Thus, the level of protective monitoring should
match business requirements, exposure to threats and risks and the business
impact of security breaches. The mandated minimum security outcomes outlined
below would help create an effective protective monitoring regime.

IS10 – All organisations must implement measures to detect, and tie to users,
unauthorised information processing activities. As a minimum requirement,
organisations must: (a) define a monitoring strategy; (b) adopt an accounting
and audit policy; (c) produce, and preserve for an agreed time, audit logs
recording user activities, exceptions, faults and security events; (d) establish
procedures for reviewing monitoring results; (e) train staff to interpret
monitoring results; (f) protect audit and logging facilities and log data; and, (g)
align protective monitoring with incident management and HR policies.

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must:


Define and adopt a protective monitoring strategy that defines the objectives,
approaches and resources required to support consistent organisation-wide
accounting, audit and monitoring activities;



Have in place an accounting and audit policy that complies with business
requirements for real-time security accounting and audit. The policy shall
help developers and product teams ensure that technical solutions consist of
suitable accounting and audit points. In addition, it should help information
assurance teams to verify the extent to which the implemented accounting
and audit features comply with NISF security accreditation requirements;



Ensure that the network security architecture contains suitable features to
identify, record, alert and generate security audit reports;



Ensure that accounting activities match the level of logging for each security
classification. IT teams must not deviate from the accounting requirements
before presenting a risk assessment and convincing management that the
new level of logging adequately assures the security of business activities;



Standardise accounting and audit log data to ease correlation in accordance
with ISO/IEC 27002;



Have in place effective procedures to review recorded logs and alerts to help
identify and hold to account those who misuse information assets;

help ensure that no user or application process gains access to accounting
and audit data without explicit authorisation and a clearly defined role;



Deny system administrators the access privileges to erase or de-activate
logs of their own activities;



Separate accounting and audit logs that support routine security activities
from evidential logs that have legal ramifications because they might contain
intrusive and confidential personal data and may be admissible in Court;



Ensure that, where protective monitoring activities collect data of relevance
in legal proceedings, it is possible to verify and demonstrate the evidential
weight of the data and ensure its legal admissibility in Courts of Law;



environment and results of technical risk assessments.

Information Back-Ups
Achieving the mandated minimum information security outcomes outlined below
can ensure the integrity and availability of data, software and documentation and
enable quick recovery from disasters or media failures. Back-ups should cover
all information processing environments such as live and pre-production.

IS11 – All organisations must adopt formal policies and procedures to backup
and regularly test copies of information and software required to recover from
major disruptions. As a minimum requirement, organisations must: (a) define
the required back-up levels; (b) base the frequency of back-ups on the value,
criticality and sensitivity of data; (c) produce accurate and complete records of
back-up copies; (d) store back-up data a safe distance away from the main
site; (e) afford back-up information suitable physical and environmental
protection; and, (f) test back-up media regularly to ensure its recoverability.

UNCLASSIFIED

5.13

Security Accreditation
There must be a clear plan to provide stakeholders relevant information about
how an organisation complies with the mandated NISF minimum security
requirements. Organisations demonstrate compliance with security requirements
by creating a body of evidence containing procedures, processes, instructions
and plans for maintaining the security of an information system throughout its
life. The mandated minimum information security outcomes below would show
that the organisation has identified and addressed major risks to vital systems.

IS12 – All protected Government computers must be accredited to the NISF
Risk Management and Accreditation Standard. As a minimum requirement,
organisations must: (a) accept and retain accountability for accreditation; (b)

Personnel Security

6.1.1

Introduction
Employees are the most important asset for any organisation. However, staff
could also be potent threat sources and actors. Indeed, changes in national
information security policies worldwide have roots in high-profile accidental and
deliberate disclosures of sensitive national security and personal information.
Therefore, it is vital to reduce the likelihood of staff exploiting legitimate access
to critical infrastructure facilities, sites, information and staff for unauthorised use.
Personnel security is important in the context of defending the cyber supply
chain against State and industrial espionage threats. This section outlines the
steps that organisations that use, own and/or operate critical infrastructure must
take to establish the trustworthiness, integrity and reliability of individuals before
granting them access to sensitive information assets.

6.1.2

Personnel Security and Risk Management
The themes contained in “Part I – Security Governance” apply to the personnel
security functional area in the same way as information and physical security.
For example, the personnel security area requires a credible risk management
approach as follows. There are no guarantees in security. This is more so
concerning personnel security. It is impossible to guarantee that people would
always behave reliably. For example, honest individuals experience changes in
lifestyle, which could affect their reliability. Changes such as new spouses and
starting a family could put individuals under financial pressure challenging their
integrity. In other instances, reckless personal behaviour and entrapment could
increase susceptibility to blackmail. Therefore, organisations must follow the risk
management principle and the mandatory security requirement presented in part
1, to decide the level of acceptable personnel security risk at any given time. As
a result, mandatory minimum personnel security requirements are as follows:

6.2

Security Roles & Responsibilities
National legislation such as the Official Secrets Act, 1964 and newer laws such
as the Computer Misuse Act, 2011 generally aim to reduce unlawful misuse of
information, in particular that has been entrusted in confidence to Government
officers, employees and contractors. However, it is difficult to enforce such laws
in Courts of Law if organisations fail to demonstrate that employees, contractors
and third party users understood their responsibilities. Achieving the mandated
minimum information security outcomes below would help an organisation show
that it has taken due care to ensure that the individuals understand expectations.

PS1 – To reduce the risk of theft, fraud or misuse of facilities, organisations
must ensure that all users understand their information security responsibilities.
As a minimum requirement, organisations must: (a) communicate security
expectations to all employment candidates; (b) include security duties in the
employment contracts that all staff must agree and sign; (c) require staff to sign

UNCLASSIFIED

and abide by Security Operating Procedures (SyOps) for specified critical
infrastructure or services; (e) inform staff that non-compliance with the signed
security documents may lead to disciplinary action; and, (f) enforce sanctions
for non-compliance including dismissal and prosecution.

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must:

6.3



Require all employees, including contractors and subcontractors to accept
their security roles and responsibilities formally. The acceptance shall include
an undertaking to: (i) protect assets under their control and/or supervision
from unauthorised access, disclosure, modification, destruction and
interference; (ii) comply with security processes and activities; and, (iii) report
security events or potential events or other security risks to the organisation;



Ensure that individuals agree to abide by all GoU and organisational policies,
standards, protocols and guidelines for protecting information, personnel and
physical assets against security threats regardless of type and origin; and



Confirm that, as part of the HR process, all employees, including contractors
and subcontractors, accessing and/or operating critical infrastructure sign
declaration forms acknowledging their obligation to abide by the Official
Secrets Act, 1964 and related laws during and after their employment.

Baseline Security Clearance
Baseline Security (BS) clearance provides reasonable assurance that individuals
seeking access to critical infrastructure are reliable. Therefore, all candidates
seeking employment or contracts in role requiring access to critical infrastructure
must undergo and pass BS vetting checks. The level of checks undertaken
would depend on business requirements, perceived risks and the value,
sensitivity and criticality of the information assets. The bottom line is that BS
vetting checks apply to all users of critical infrastructure.

6.3.1

Baseline Security Clearance Defined
This clearance is for individuals that would have access to information up to and
including RESTRICTED, and/or occasional, controlled and supervised access to
information up to and including SECRET. Achieving the mandated minimumsecurity outcomes below boosts confidence in the reliability of people accessing
sensitive assets.

PS2 – All organisations must perform Baseline Security checks to ensure that
the character and personal circumstances of individuals seeking employment
are such that they can be trusted with access to critical infrastructure. As a
minimum requirement, organisations must: (a) satisfactorily validate the
identity of all applicants; (b) confirm academic, employment and financial

UNCLASSIFIED

records; (c) undertake criminal record checks; (d) establish that applicants are
entitled to undertake the employment in question; and, (e) record and risk
manage cases where it is impossible to perform all the required checks.

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must:


Ensure that HR processes do not allow anyone to commence work on critical
infrastructure projects without undergoing appropriate recruitment checks;



Verify the identity of the candidate by conducting independent checks using
Government or third party issued documents such as passports or similar
photographic identity documents;



Establish whether the applicant has the right to work in Uganda including
meeting residency requirements based on the sensitivity of the position;



Check the candidate’s employment record by validating the completeness
and accuracy of the curriculum vitae;



Obtain satisfactory character references about the applicant e.g. one
business and one personal;



Establish whether the applicant is qualified for the job by confirming the
claimed academic and professional qualifications; and



Based on risk assessment, determine whether the applicant is liable to
undergo additional national security vetting described in section 7.4.

National Security Vetting
A security clearance is a status granted to individuals that allows them to access
certain information. Security clearance is important for critical positions because
occupants of such positions who successfully commit acts such as illegal site
access, data espionage, illegal interception, data and system interference cause
more significant damage to national security and interests that those in less
sensitive positions. Therefore, national security vetting seeks to stop individuals
wishing to subvert or damage the stability of Uganda from occupying sensitive
positions dealing with critical infrastructure. The national security vetting process
involves tougher checks than BS vetting using two clearance levels as follows:

6.4.1

SECRET Clearance
This security clearance level is for individuals who require frequent and
uncontrolled access to information up to and including SECRET.

6.4.2

TOP SECRET Clearance
This clearance level is for individuals in privileged and sensitive managerial,
technical and information security roles who require frequent and uncontrolled
access to information marked or labelled up to and including TOP SECRET.
Organisations must keep such roles to a minimum number of staff. It is important
to emphasise that, in common with all forms of security, national security vetting
provides no guarantees about the future reliability of vetting subjects. However,
effective national security vetting can help achieve the outcomes below.

PS3 – Individuals requiring access to computers necessary for Uganda’s
security, defence, diplomacy, public safety, public utilities and economic
stability must undergo national security vetting. As a minimum requirement,
organisations must: (a) submit for security vetting all applicants for roles on the
list of GoU security vetted positions; (b) not initiate the national security vetting
process before completing recruitment checks; and, (c) seek Security
Controller advice on the required clearance levels before making job offers.

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must:


Create a process to comply with the national security vetting requirements of
appropriate vetting organisations;



Ensure that the Security Controller has the current list of GoU security vetted
positions and that all candidates for positions on the list undergo national
security vetting before starting work;



Ensure that the holding of a valid security clearance is not a routine condition
for applying for posts or contracts on the list GoU security vetted positions.
41

UNCLASSIFIED

However, in exceptional situations, for example where the clearance process
would take longer than the contract, organisations might make it a condition.
Organisations must record the exceptions for audit and legal reasons;


Be aware that security vetting can occur either during recruitment or at any
stage when business requirements, perceived risks, sensitivity and value of
information warrants more assurances about the employee’s character and
personal circumstances;



Have a GoU Ministry, Department, Agency sponsor for all security clearance
applications;



Subject to national security considerations and guided by the Need-to-Know
principle, the sponsoring GoU entities should inform individuals when they
submit their names for national security vetting;



Ensure that candidates understand that, whilst no one is obliged to undergo
national security vetting, occupancy of posts on the GoU list of security
vetted positions is reliant upon obtaining and keeping a security clearance;



Rely on risk assessment to determine the necessity for, and the level of,
security vetting undertaken for candidates aiming for sensitive positions. For
example, support and ancillary staff may have to undergo appropriate vetting
depending on the results of the risk management exercise;



For sensitive positions, organisations may in accordance with relevant laws,
regulations and ethics, evaluate the applicant’s likelihood to succumb to
pressure and/or inducement to exploit their legitimate access to premises,
information and staff for unauthorised use by conducting detailed checks of
the applicant’s financial matters such as credit references, assets held
individually and with family members, financial commitments, unpaid bills etc;



In strict adherence with relevant laws, regulations and ethics, organisations
may consider whether the personal circumstances of the individuals such
as medical and criminal history as well as behaviour could pose a security
risk were that person to gain employment in a sensitive position;



Work with vetting organisations to find solutions to delayed clearances. For
example, an employee may work “at risk” for a specified time, as long as the
individual is being vetted and is working under supervision;



Only disclose the information gathered for the security clearance application
to organisations with a legitimate Need-to-Know. In addition, organisations
must only retain the security clearance information for as long as necessary;



Make a risk-based decision on whether to rely on the security vetting results
obtained from another organisation on a candidate under consideration, restart the vetting process or conduct more checks;



Subject to national security considerations, have in place a mechanism for
providing individuals reasons for the refusal of a security clearance;



Have in place a policy for dealing with existing employees who cannot
continue in their existing position and/or take up a new position because of
an adverse security vetting result. The policy must address issues such as
re-deployment and appeal procedures. Additionally, organisations must have

42

UNCLASSIFIED

clear, legal and ethical dismissal procedures for staff who fail a vetting check
but whose occupancy of positions requires a valid security clearance.

6.5

Ongoing Personnel Security Management
Baseline and national security vetting checks only provide assurance about the
individual’s security reliability at a given point in time only. In reality, baseline and
national security vetting occurs before the individual joins a new organisation
and/or changes jobs. Both screening exercises may not expose the vetting
subject’s full susceptibility to personal misbehaviour and/or amenability to
influence. Therefore, ongoing personnel security management aims to achieve
the mandated outcomes below.

PS4 – All organisations must monitor the continued security reliability of
individuals holding a GoU security clearance. As a minimum requirement,
organisations must: (a) maintain a record of security cleared individuals; (b)
ensure that only those with a business need maintain access to protected
computer assets; (c) identify changes in personal circumstances; (d) inform
individuals that failure to advise GoU vetting agencies of any significant
changes in personal circumstances may lead to disciplinary action; (e)
undertake periodic security appraisals; (f) investigate anything that may affect
an individual’s suitability to access critical infrastructure; and, (g) sanction noncompliance.

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must:


Maintain up to date personnel security records of security cleared individuals
as well as refused and withdrawn security vetting applications;



Ensure that security clearances undergo regular review and/or when material
facts or changes come to light to ensure that records are updated and reaffirm the individual’s suitability to hold a security clearance at a given level;



Inform national vetting organisations of any security incidents that may affect
the individual’s continued suitability to hold a GoU security clearance;



Submit individuals to pro-active security appraisals, annually and/or when
circumstances dictate, during which the vetting subject shall declare changes
in professional and personal circumstances and any security concerns that
might materially affect their suitability to retain a security clearance at a given
level. Individuals must understand that vetting organisations would regard
any failure to disclose material and security relevant changes to personal
circumstances as unreliability to the detriment of their security clearances;



Line managers and other staff have a duty to work with HR to identify, report
and investigate significant changes to the individual’s behaviour, personal
circumstances and attitudes to risk. Common warning signs include drug and
alcohol abuse, changes in working patterns, lateness etc;
43

UNCLASSIFIED



Ensure that access control measures maintain adherence to the Need-toKnow principle to make sure, that all times, individuals only have access to
premises, information and staff they need to perform their jobs. In keeping
with the mandated access management security outcome, organisations
must review the appropriateness of access rights regularly; and



Have in place formal processes for investigating suspected non-compliance
with security rules. Any such investigations, legal or disciplinary cases must
comply with relevant laws, regulations and ethics.

IV.
Physical Security

7

Physical Security
Physical security is about stopping unauthorised physical access, damage, and
interference to information, premises and resources by a range of physical
security threats including crime, espionage, natural disasters and acts of
terrorism. It also protects personnel against violence and other sorts of harm.

7.1.1

Physical Security, Governance and Risk Management
The themes contained in “Part I – Security Governance” apply to the physical
security functional area. For example, physical security also adopts the PDCA
continuous improvement model to structure all its governance processes.
Indeed, physical security measures are more effective when considered at all
phases of the broader organisational security programme. Physical security is
harder and more expensive to ‘bolt-on’ after the event. Physical security also
complies with mandated minimum security requirements on risk management
contained in the Governance section of this policy. Thus, good physical security
measures match business and security needs.

7.1.2

Physical Security in Context
Physical security measures work alongside and indeed are the bedrock of other
areas of security such as information and personnel security. Physical security
represented the bulk of security measures in the mainframe era. Organisations
invested substantial sums of money to restrict personnel access, used locks and
alarms and implemented environmental controls to cool the giant machines. It all
changed when computers became cheaper and smaller. For example, section
6.10 shows that remote access increases the risks of equipment and data theft
because it occurs in exposed environments such as homes or when travelling.

7.2

Physical Security Perimeter
This policy requires organisations to put in place an adequate physical perimeter
around sensitive information processing facilities to stop unauthorised physical
access. A perimeter is the whole area surrounding the building hosting protected
computer assets including roads, footpaths and any other areas just outside the
building. The physical security perimeter is the first layer of a ‘layered’ or
‘defence-in-depth’ approach to security that progressively increases the difficulty
of security controls the closer one gets to areas containing sensitive information
assets. As noted earlier, the physical security controls that the perimeter
enforces must align with business needs and be cost-effective. The costs of the
controls must not substantially outstrip the impact of loss. If the costs outstrip the
impact of loss, organisations should consider avoiding the risk, for example by
moving the assets to data centres that are easier to secure. By minimising the
risk of theft, destruction and unauthorised access, the security perimeter can
help achieve the following mandated minimum security outcomes.

UNCLASSIFIED

PH1 – All organisations must have appropriate security perimeters to shield
facilities hosting critical infrastructure against a range of physical security
threats including crime, natural disasters and acts of terrorism. As a minimum
requirement, organisations must: (a) allocate physical security roles and
responsibilities in particular designate a security controller; (b) conduct physical
security risk assessments before site selection; (c) design into or require
changes to a site’s security; (d) have effective access controls; (e) log and
review access; (f) prepare for, detect and respond to physical incidents.

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must:

7.3



Allocate physical security roles to facilities hosting critical infrastructure. In
common with information and personnel security, the Information Risk Owner
shall have overall responsibility for physical security risk management at
Board-level. The Information Risk Owner should appoint a Security
Controller to oversee day-to-day security aspects of a facility or group of
facilities. The Controller shall be Ugandan and either full-time or part-time
depending on business needs, costs and risks including national security;



Have in place a physical security policy that describes in appropriate detail
how the organisation would define, apply and evidence physical security
controls in all its locations in accordance with US ISO/IEC 27001:2005;



Ensure that no classified GoU data is processed, stored or transmitted to and
from any facility without a full risk assessment and formal approval from the
GoU client and relevant GoU national security agencies;



Choose the data centre site carefully taking into consideration issues such as
its visibility; proximity to hazards and crime; natural disasters; transportation;
access to environmental controls and emergency services;



Ensure that the site is designed securely with careful consideration for wall
height and fire rating; ceiling fire and weight bearing ratings; door and
window design and strength; electricity and environmental controls;



Clearly define the perimeter and ensure that its location and strength
corresponds with the security requirements of the assets within the boundary
and the results of a risk assessment;



Ensure that the perimeters are physically sound with no gaps to enable easy
break-in. In addition, external walls of the site must be of solid construction
with all external doors suitably protected against unauthorised access with
control mechanisms, e.g. bars, alarms, locks etc; and



Ensure that Security Standard No. 5 – Physical Security (SS5) and
referenced material therein are the main source of guidance on physical
security matters.

Physical Entry Controls
Secure areas within information processing facilities must have appropriate entry
controls to stop unauthorised personnel from gaining access. In keeping with the
47

UNCLASSIFIED

risk management/proportionality principle, the physical entry controls in place
must be commensurate with business and security requirements. Physical entry
controls can help achieve the following mandated minimum-security outcomes.

PH2 – Organisations must use appropriate entry controls to protect secure
areas against physical security threats. As a minimum requirement,
organisations must have: (b) baseline security controls such as guards, fencing
and external monitoring; (b) access card systems to identify employees, log
and manage access rights; (c) visitor management processes to enable visitor
sign-in, badge allocation, escorting and pass verification; and, (d) employee
management processes including requirement to wear identification and carry
access cards and the control of equipment movements.

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must:


Ensure that all facilities have in place baseline physical access controls to
safeguard information resources therein including an on-duty security guard
force; fencing (i.e. fences, gates, turnstiles and mantraps) and external
security guard patrols, outside Closed Circuit Television (CCTV) monitoring
or a combination of both. In addition, organisations must mandate the use of
access cards for access to buildings;



Ensure that all visitors report to the security reception and produce proof of
identification before gaining access to sensitive facilities. The visitors must
sign-in and sign-out and must wear an appropriate badge e.g. unescorted or
escorted at all times;



Record the date and time of entry and departure for all visitors. In addition,
visitors must only gain access to premises supporting critical infrastructure
for specific and authorised purposes;



Visitors receive a briefing on the security procedures of the secure facility
including emergency procedures;



Control and restrict access to areas designated for processing or storing
sensitive information to authorised persons only;



Have in place appropriate authentication controls e.g. access control cards
plus PIN to manage and validate access and securely maintain an audit trail
of all access;



Require all staff and visitors to wear visible identification at all times. All staff
at a facility have a duty to notify security personnel if they encounter
unescorted visitors and anyone not wearing visible identification;



Grant third party support service personnel restricted access to secure areas
or sensitive facilities when required only and monitor the access; and
Review, update and revoke access rights to secure areas regularly.



7.4

Internal Data Centre Physical Access Controls
Internal areas of information processing facilities require additional physical
security controls because this is where sensitive information is processed or
stored. The internal areas include the data centre, communication and switching
centres and end-user areas. The areas require more stringent personnel security
controls to safeguard the information processed therein. Organisations must
develop a general access control policy for use in the data centre to achieve the
following mandated minimum security outcomes.

PH3 – Organisations must implement appropriate internal physical security
controls to defend critical infrastructure against physical attacks. As a minimum
requirement, organisations must match the value, sensitivity and criticality of
assets with: (a) data centre classifications; (b) data centre location
requirements; (c) infrastructure and perimeter security measures; (d) access
controls; (e) access control logging levels; (f) package handling mechanisms;
(g) visitor management systems; and, (h) tape handling approach.

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must:


Classify data centres according to their criticality to the continued operation
of one or major business activities. The categories may be as simple as A
(TOP SECRET); B (SECRET); and C (RESTRICTED);



Use the data centre classifications to guide location decisions. For example,
due to their criticality, class A data centres may be located in a separate
building with a fenced perimeter etc. Based on business needs an
organisation may specify the minimum distance, for example a Class C data
centre may be in the same building or city as the production site;



Use the data centre classifications to determine data centre infrastructure,
access control and access logging, package, visitor and tape handling
requirements. For example, class A data centre may require security staff to
monitor activity via CCTV, limited interior and external visibility from the
computer and motion detection;



Ensure that sites processing, storing or handling classified information have
secure rooms with an Intruder Detection System (IDS) installed. Security
must respond to IDS alerts in a timely manner;



Ensure that personnel only know of the existence of, or activities within, a
secure area on a Need-to-Know basis;



Avoid unsupervised working in secure areas both for safety reasons and to
reduce opportunities for malicious activities;



Physically lock and periodically check vacant secure areas; and



Unless authorised for a business purpose, ban the use of photographic,
video, audio or other recording equipment, such as cameras on mobile
devices in sensitive secure rooms. Based on security needs, users may have
to surrender such devices at the security desk when visiting secure areas.

UNCLASSIFIED

7.5

Equipment Security
In accordance with US ISO/IEC 27001, organisations must protect equipment
against physical and environmental threats. The security measures help reduce
the risk of unauthorised access to information and loss or damage to equipment.
The measures have strong importance to equipment used offsite. Organisations
must also protect supporting facilities such as electrical supply and cabling
infrastructure. Equipment security aims to achieve the security outcomes below.

PH4 – Organisations must implement appropriate measures to prevent the
physical loss, damage, theft or compromise of equipment and infrastructure
supporting critical infrastructure. As a minimum requirement, organisations
must: (a) locate all production equipment within the access-controlled
boundaries of the data centre; (b) protect power and telecom cabling against
interception or damage; (c) use reliable electrical power supply; and, (d)
manage risks to off-site equipment, information or software.

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must:


Host all production computer systems such as servers, desktops, firewalls,
etc in the secure areas of the data centre to prevent unauthorised access;



Position devices processing sensitive data such as displays in a way that
reduces the viewing opportunities of unauthorised persons during their use;



Protect power lines supporting IT services and telecommunications wiring
against unauthorised access, damage or disruption through tapping. Where
possible, locate cabling underground and use protective shielding;



Have in place controls to minimise the risk of potential physical threats, e.g.
theft, fire, explosives, smoke, water (or water supply failure), dust, vibration,
chemical effects, electrical supply interference, communications interference,
electromagnetic radiation, and vandalism;



Establish and enforce guidelines for eating, drinking, and smoking in
proximity to information processing facilities;



Monitor environmental conditions, such as temperature and humidity for
conditions, which could adversely affect information processing facilities;



Have in place measures to protect power and telecom cabling against
interception or damage by installing lightning protection to all buildings and
fitting lightning filters to incoming power and communications lines; and



Address risk of off-site equipment, information and software in accordance
with the guidelines outlined in section 6.10 – Remote Access Security.

50

UNCLASSIFIED

7.6

Secure Equipment Disposal & Re-Use
Organisations must have in place measures to manage the security risks
associated with the disposal and re-use of computer storage media holding
sensitive information. The measures must cover the sanitisation and disposal of
storage assets into secure and less secure environments for repair, exchange
and recycling. Timely and cost-effective secure equipment disposal and re-use
procedures can help achieve the following mandated security outcomes.

PH5 – All organisations must adopt formal procedures to enable the secure
disposal and re-use of storage media. To minimise the risk of unauthorised
retrieval or reconstruction of erased data, organisations must, as a minimum
requirement: (a) define secure disposal criteria; (b) define secure sanitisation
levels commensurate with information sensitivity; (c) group storage media that
requires the same treatment; (d) define criteria to guide repair, re-use,
exchange or physical destruction decisions; (e) validate the success of
sanitisation exercises; and, (f) log decommissioning activities.

To achieve the security outcomes mandated above, organisations must:


Ensure that all media used to store and process sensitive information such
as networking devices; magnetic disks and tapes; office equipment; solid
state devices (SSDs); and optical disks is sanitised and disposed of in
accordance with organisational policies and procedures;



Have in place policies and processes that define secure sanitisation levels to
help all relevant stakeholders understand the degree of wiping required to
provide reasonable assurance that data from a decommissioned asset would
not be retrieved or reconstructed;



Adopt a process to guide sanitisation activities including asset classification
verification; sanitisation and post-sanitisation activities; validation of the
success of the sanitisation activities and final sign-off; and



Ensure that where it is not possible to destroy assets handling sensitive data
securely, procedures are in place to enable their secure storage and/or
return to its owner.
