Annex 1 to Government Decision No. 1139/2013 (21 March)
National Cyber Security Strategy of Hungary
1. In accordance with the principles of the Fundamental Law and based on the
review of the relevant values and interests and on the analysis of the security
environment of the cyberspace, the purpose of this Strategy is to determine
national objectives and strategic directions, tasks and comprehensive government
tools which enable Hungary to enforce its national interests in the Hungarian
cyberspace, within the context of the global cyberspace. The strategy aims at
developing a free and secure cyberspace and protecting national sovereignty in the
national and international context, which has undergone a significant change due
to the emergence of the cyberspace, a new medium which has become a key factor
in the 21st century. Furthermore, it aims at protecting the activities and
guaranteeing the security of national economy and society, securely adapting
technological innovations to facilitate economic growth, and establishing
international cooperation in this regard in line with Hungary’s national interests.
This Strategy indicates that Hungary is ready to perform and take responsibility for
cyberspace protection tasks and intends to develop the Hungarian cyberspace as a
key element of Hungarian economic and social life into a free, secure and
innovative environment. By way of efficient protective measures based on
prevention, the primary objective is to manage the threats and risks emerging in
and coming from the cyberspace, as well as to reinforce government coordination
and measures.
2. This Strategy reflects the basic values enshrined in the Fundamental Law of
Hungary, specifically freedom, security, rule of law, international and European
cooperation, in a separate field within security and economic policy; it is a
document of cyber security for national data assets as part of national assets,
derived from Section 38 of the Fundamental Law, as well as for the related critical
infrastructures. In accordance with the Hungarian National Security Strategy,
accepted by Government Decision No. 1035/2012 (21 February), and based
thereupon, the Strategy elaborates the government efforts and responsibility laid
down in Section 31 thereof. Its roots date back to the Budapest Convention
adopted in 2001 (“Convention on Cybercrime”); an international agreement
defining internationally recognised principles used as a reference. At the same
time, the Strategy is in conformity with the recommendations of the European
Parliament for the Member States included in Decision No. 2012/2096(INI) on
cyber security and defence, adopted on 22 November 2012, and with the joint
communication published by the European Commission and the High
Representative of the Common Foreign and Security Policy of the European Union
on 7 February 2013 under the title “Cybersecurity Strategy of the European Union:
An Open, Safe and Secure Cyberspace”. Furthermore, the Strategy is in line with
the Strategic Concept of the NATO accepted in November 2010, the Cyber
Security Policy of the Organisation adopted in June 2011 and its implementation
plan, as well as with the cyber protection principles and objectives set forth in the
documents of the NATO summits held on 19-20 November 2010 in Lisbon and on
20-21 May 2012 in Chicago.
I. The cyber security environment in Hungary

3. Cyberspace means the combined phenomenon of globally interconnected,
decentralised and ever-growing electronic information systems as well as the
societal and economic processes appearing in and through these systems in the
form of data and information. The Hungarian cyberspace includes the parts of the
electronic information systems of the global cyberspace which are located in
Hungary, as well as the societal and economic processes appearing in and through
the electronic systems of the global cyberspace in the form of data and information
that take place in, are directed to, or affect Hungary.
4. The increasing number and various sources of threats emerging in cyberspace as
well as the increasing order of magnitude of their consequences indicate that the
number and efficiency of public and non-public users has grown rapidly for the
past decade who use cyberspace to illegally acquire critical data or information and
disrupt communication and information systems. Our vital electronic information
systems and consequently, the functioning of our critical infrastructures are
threatened by a new form of warfare, information warfare, making cyberspace one
of the most important theatres in modern warfare. In addition to the damage caused
by external factors, the inadequate regulation of the operational security of the
information and communication systems constituting cyberspace poses a further
risk. Dynamic emerging new technologies, such as cloud computing or mobile
Internet, lead to the continuous evolution of new security risks. One of the key
objectives of this Strategy is to create awareness and capacity at the political and
professional decision making level which can manage the new cyber security
challenges arising from technological progress by flexibly adapting to them in the
foreseeable future.
5. Cyber security is the continuous and planned taking of political, legal, economic,
educational, awareness-raising and technical measures to manage risks in
cyberspace that transforms the cyberspace into a reliable environment for the
smooth functioning and operation of societal and economic processes by ensuring
an acceptable level of risks in cyberspace.
II. Hungary’s set of values, vision and objectives relating to cybersecurity

6. The protection of Hungary’s sovereignty in the Hungarian cyberspace is a
national interest, too; a free, democratic and secure functioning of the Hungarian
cyberspace based on the rule of law is regarded as a fundamental value and
interest. In Hungary, the freedom and security of cyberspace is ensured through the
close cooperation and coordinated activities between Government, academia,
business sector and civil society based on their shared responsibility.
7. Hungary aims at establishing and maintaining trust-based cooperation with all
public and private actors of the global cyberspace sharing the same set of values
with Hungary, and endevours to guarantee free and secure use of the global
cyberspace through its allies and international relations, particularly the EU and the
NATO, the Organization on Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), the
United Nations, the Council of Europe and other international organisations in
which the country is a member. Being aware of the fact that threats and attacks
emerging in cyberspace may escalate to the level requiring allied cooperation,
Hungary considers it highly important that cybersecurity has become an issue for
collective defence under Article 5 of the founding treaty of NATO. Hungary is

interested in this allied international cooperation for the sake of its own security,
too. Hungary regards the Central and Eastern European region with special
attention, where cybersecurity can be further improved within the framework of
regional cooperations.
8. To address present and future challenges, Hungary lays down the requirement
that the Hungarian cyberspace shall provide a secure and reliable environment:
a)
for individuals and communities to ensure social development and
integration through communication based on liberty, freedom from fear, and
guaranteeing the protection of personal data,
b)
for the business sector to develop efficient and innovative business
solutions,
c)
for future generations to ensure value-based learning and unharmed
collection of experiences resulting in a sound mental development,
d)
for electronic public administration, to promote innovative and cutting-edge
development of public services.
9. In the interest of a free and secure use of cyberspace, Hungary lays downs the
following objectives to be met by aligning the interests of national security,
efficient crisis management and user protection:
a)
to have efficient capabilities to prevent, detect, manage (react), respond to
and recover any malicious cyber activity, threat, attack or emergency, as well as
accidental information leakage,
b)
to provide adequate protection for its national data assets, to ensure the
operational safety of the parts of its critical infrastructures linked to cyberspace,
and to have a rapid, efficient mitigating and recovery capability in case of a
compromise, deployable also during a state of emergency,
c)
to ensure that the quality of IT and communication products and services
necessary for the secure operation of the Hungarian cyberspace meet the
requirements of international best practices, with special emphasis on compliance
with international security certification standards,
d)
to ensure that the quality of education, training as well as research and
development meets the requirements of international best practices, thus
contributing to the establishment of a world-class national knowledge pool,
e)
to ensure that the establishment of a secure cyberspace for children and
future generations meets the requirements of international best practices.
III. Tasks necessary to meet the objectives

10. The cybersecurity situation of Hungary is fundamentally solid. Arising from the
special structure of cyberspace, however, a number of security risks and threats
constituting a strategic challenge to the nation need to be considered. The tools
available for maintaining and improving the level of cybersecurity and to meet the
objectives, as well as the areas affected by fulfilling the tasks are the following:
a)
Government coordination. Primarily, each government institution assumes
its own responsibility for the free and secure use of cyberspace. However, due to
the complexity of this area, these responsibilities can only meet the Government’s
objective regarding a free and secure use of cyberspace through a clear and
efficient government coordination. Therefore, the central government coordination
through the Prime Minister’s Office shall be strengthened, a mandatory step for the
coordinated and concentrated use of government and sectoral resources.

Cooperation. Improved cooperation and efficient information sharing are
needed to meet our objectives and cybersecurity interests. To this end, it is
necessary to create operational cooperation fora ensuring the participation of
representatives of business sector and academia in preparing governmental
decision making, enabling the members of these fora to put forward
recommendations or opinions on the development and continuous improvement of
cybersecurity activities.
c) Specialised institutions. Cybersecurity tasks should be assigned to organisations
with specific skills and powers, cooperating not only with each other but also with
other authorities responsible for data protection and classified information
protection. These tasks affect organisations responsible for national security,
defence, law enforcement, disaster management and critical infrastructure
protection, as well as authorities responsible for electronic information security.
Cybersecurity incidents are handled by the Government Incident Response Centre
as an accredited member of the European Governmental CERT Group, as well as
the Sectoral Incident Response Centres in various sectors.
d) Regulation. In addition to a complex legislation, it is necessary to conclude
cooperation agreements with actors of civil society, business sector and academia
to provide an adequate basis and regulation for the efficient operation of
cybersecurity based on shared responsibility.
a) International cooperation projects. Hungary wishes to enhance its role in
cyberdefence initiatives and cooperation projects within the EU and the NATO, as
well as in the cybersecurity cooperation projects of the UN and the OSCE. It
strives to carry on and expand cooperation regarding cyberdefence exercise and
planning within the EU and the NATO, and maintain its leading role in developing
and running operational government cooperations, as well as in the Central and
Eastern European region. Hungary lays special emphasis on implementing
activities that are, on the one hand specified by the Digital Agenda of the European
Union for the Member States and, on the other hand, prescribed by the NATO
Cyber Security Policy and its implementation plan for allies. Hungary deems the
North Atlantic cooperation very important in respect of cyber security. Hungary
continues to play an active role in the European, Atlantic and global organisations
of national/governmental and Sectoral Incident Handling Centres, in the European
Network and Information Security Agency, and in the Board of European
Electronic Communications Authorities.
e) Awareness. Hungary maintains its leadership in organising Hungarian and
international cybersecurity forums. Through its specialised institutions and via
cooperation with actors of civil society, business sector and academia, it supports
activities for the secure use of cyberspace and raising awareness, as well as
initiatives promoting practical cybersecurity skills, with special focus on
awareness-raising among individual users and small and medium-sized enterprises.
f) Education, research & development. Hungary pays particular attention to
integrating cyber security as a field in the information technology syllabus of
primary, secondary and higher education, in training courses for government
officials and in professional training courses. Hungary strives for strategic
cooperation with university and scientific research centres which have achieved
outstanding and internationally recognised results in cybersecurity research and
development and help to establish cybersecurity centres of excellence.
b)
Child protection. Hungary regards the creation and maintenance of an
environment allowing the healthy development of children as a basic element of
cybersecurity, and treats it as a priority in all affected areas, achieving, at the same
b)

time, the objectives of the European Strategy for a Better Internet for Children.
Particular emphasis is laid on encouraging the creation of quality online content for
young people, supporting awareness-raising and preparatory measures, the
prevention of the harassment and exploitation of children, and the establishment of
a secure online environment. For this purpose, Hungarian non-governmental
organisations with a proven record in online child protection are regarded as key
partners.
g)
Motivation of business actors. In determining cyber security requirements
for public procurement tenders in information technology and communications,
Hungary intends to encourage equipment manufacturers and service providers
submitting bids to create the highest possible level of cybersecurity, with special
emphasis on compliance with international certification standards. Furthermore,
Hungary wishes to cooperate with business actors to develop incentive measures
for cybersecurity improvement.
IV. Government tools that are available or in need of reinforcement for
implementing the National CyberSecurity Strategy
11. Hungary is already in the possession of most tools required to meet its strategic
objectives as regards capabilities and potential resources, including:
a)
stocktaking and coordination of the government organisations responsible
for the security of the Hungarian cyberspace, establishment of efficient
cooperation;
b)
review of the civil society, business and academic organisations responsible
for the security of the Hungarian cyberspace, establishment of institutional
cooperation;
c)
stocktaking of critical information infrastructures and critical assets, as well
as national data assets, in addition, ensuring their protection;
d)
operation of specialised Government institutions;
e)
provision of a regulatory environment;
f)
participation in international and regional cooperation at political,
operational and regulatory levels;
g)
establishment of a support framework for research & development,
education and awareness-raising;
h)
establishment of business motivation systems;
i)
integrating cybersecurity aspects in technical developments under state
control and in tasks related to the development and operation of the Government’s
information systems.
12. The reinforcement and more efficient use of the available tools and their more
effective practical application in terms of national security require the
establishment and operation of a system for intra-governmental and nongovernmental cooperation.
