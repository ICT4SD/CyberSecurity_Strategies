Cyber Security Strategy

1

Purpose and summary
Slovenia’s cyber security strategy will improve the country’s cyber security assurance system, while
also systematically regulating this area. Strengthening the overall system is necessary because of the
ever-growing importance of cyber security for the smooth functioning of the systems the whole
society depends on. Moreover, the state is encouraged and bound to do so by national and
international strategic documents. An efficient cyber security assurance system is not and cannot be
cheap, but it is incomparably cheaper than fixing any consequences that might arise as a result of
security incidents if such systems were missing.
The strategy comprises an overview of the situation in those areas that are relevant for cyber
security assurance, outlining the vision and setting objectives. It further defines the areas where it
will be implemented, as well as the risks occurring in cyberspace. The strategy proposes the way the
cyber security assurance system should be organised, and the measures necessary for achieving the
set objectives.

Cyber Security Strategy

1

Introduction

In modern world, the use of information systems and networks is constantly increasing, and
therefore the importance of these systems for the successful development of economic and noncommercial activities, as well as the life and welfare of the society as a whole, is also increasing.
Network and information security contributes to strengthening important societal values and
objectives in the society, such as human rights and fundamental freedoms, democracy, the rule of
law, and economic and political stability.
On the one hand, the increasingly rapid development of information and communication
technologies (ICT) brings benefits to modern society, while on the other it gives rise to ever new and
technologically more sophisticated cyber threats. The trend in the use of ICT for political, economic
and military supremacy is becoming more and more pronounced. Undoubtedly, cyber attacks are
among the most significant security threats to the modern world, and therefore, cyber security has
become an important, integral part of national security.
In order to strengthen the cyber security assurance system, the state is encouraged and bound to
adopt strategic documents at the national and international levels. This issue is addressed in the
Resolution on the National Security Strategy of the Republic of Slovenia1, the Cyber Security Strategy
of the European Union "Open, safe and secure cyberspace"2, and Draft Directive on measures to
ensure a common high level of network and information security across the Union3.
This strategy will help Slovenia define its measures for establishing a national cyber security system
that will facilitate a rapid response to security threats and will serve to effectively protect the ICT
infrastructure and information systems, thus ensuring the continuous operation of both public and
private sectors, and, in particular, the key functions of the state and society in all security situations.
Ensuring the security of cyberspace4 will be balanced with the interests of ensuring safety and
economic viability as well as human rights and fundamental freedoms.

DEFINITION OF CYBER SECURITY5
Cyber security is generally defined as:
 a range of activities and other measures, both technical and non-technical, intended to protect
computers, computer networks, hard- and software and the information stored and processed
therein, including programmes and data as well as other cyberspace elements, from all threats,
including threats to national security;
 the level of protection provided by these activities and measures;

 joint professional endeavours, including research and development to implement and improve
these measures and increase their quality.

2

Analysis of the present situation

In Slovenia, there have already been a few proposals for systemic regulation of cyber security,
however, their implementation never took place. Nevertheless, it became clear that the country
needs a cyber security strategy that would join and direct the efforts of all stakeholders toward
strengthening and systematically regulating this important area.
Currently, the operational capacities to respond to cyber threats are distributed among SI-CERT6 as
the national response centre for network incidents, the Information Security Sector within the IT
Directorate at the Ministry of Public Administration, the Ministry of Defence for defence system and
protection against natural and other disasters, Slovenian Intelligence and Security Agency (SOVA) in
counter-intelligence activities, and the Police within its IT and telecommunications Office and the
Criminal Police Directorate, mainly in the Centre for Computer Investigations with the capacities to
combat cybercrime. Apart from the Police, which in the past five years has improved its capacities for
investigating and preventing cybercrime, all other bodies lack personnel, material and technical
resources, and organisation. Despite the shortcomings, the capacities at the operational level do
exist though a coordination body that would link the concerned stakeholders at the strategic level is
missing.

Slovenian Computer Emergency Response Team (SI-CERT) is a national response centre for dealing with incidents in
electronic network and information security, which has been operating within the public institute ARNES since 1995. It
coordinates incident resolution, provides technical advice in the event of intrusions, infections with computer viruses and
other abuses, and issues warnings to network administrators and general public on the current threats to electronic
networks. Currently, it also performs the tasks of Government's centre for responding to network indigents (SIGOV-CERT)
and assists in the establishment of an independent centre that will be responsible for protecting the IT infrastructure of the
state administration. SI-CERT is a member of the Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST), a member of the
group of national response centres at CERT/CC, a member of a work group of the European response centres TF-CSIRT, and
is accredited Trusted Introducer. SI-CERT is the Slovenian contact point for the security authority of the General Secretariat
of the EU Council and the national information point for the IMPACT programme of the International Telecommunication
Union (ITU).

Cyber Security Strategy

According to SI-CERT data7, 2060 incidents were handled in Slovenia in 2014, which is almost a 6.4fold increase with respect to 2008. The increasing trend regarding the above-mentioned deficiencies
of the cyber security assurance system raises concern.
Cooperation of stakeholders in cyber security assurance is not formally regulated, however, response
centres cooperate informally, unless there is a legal basis for it8. This includes providing information
about incidents and help in their resolution, the exchange of experience or the use of existing
capacities. An opportunity to establish cooperation is found, inter alia, joint participations in the
implementation of international cyber security exercises, organised by the European Network and
Information Security Agency (ENISA)9. Thus, such cooperation has already been established with
some banks, telecommunication providers and electricity distributors.
There are two awareness-raising projects: since 2011, SI-CERT has worked to raise national
awareness and holding the educational program "Safe on the Internet"10. The project’s key objective,
which is targeted at the general Slovenian public, and with a specific set of content also at small
enterprises, craftsmen and sole proprietors, is to raise the awareness on the safe use of the Internet.
The project, which is financed by the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport, is also participating in
the campaigns of the European month of cyber security.
Within the framework of the Centre for Safer Internet, which is run by a consortium consisting of the
Faculty of Social Sciences, ARNES, Slovenian Association of Friends of Youth and the Youth
Information and Counselling Centre of Slovenia - MISSS 11 and funded by the Directorate-General
Connect of the European Commission and the Ministry of Education, Science and Sport, SAFE.Si 12,
TOM Telephone and the Web Eye projects are being carried out. The SAFE.SI program operates as a
national point for raising awareness among children and adolescents about the safe use of the
Internet and mobile devices. The TOM Telephone program also informs children and adolescents
about the safe use of the Internet and mobile devices. Web Eye is an online reporting point, which –
in partnership with the police, prosecution, Ombudsman for Human Rights, Internet service
providers, public and other interested governmental and non-governmental organisations – allows
anonymous reporting of material allegedly containing instances of the sexual abuse of a minor and
hate speech on the Internet, and raises awareness on the problem of illegal web content.
In the education sector, IT or cyber security is included in the higher school study programme at the
Faculty for Security Studies of the University of Maribor, and in the curricula of study programmes at
the Faculty of Computer and Information Science and the Faculty of Social Sciences of the University
of Ljubljana, at the Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science of the University of
Maribor, the Faculty of Health Sciences of the University of Primorska, the Faculty of Information

Studies of Novo mesto, and the licensed independent higher education institution GEA College; as
part of the corporate security subject it is also included in the study programs at some other higher
education institutions. No subject in this area is taught at the primary and secondary school levels.
In accordance with its abilities, Slovenia participates in international cyber security exercises. In
Cyber Europe exercises, organised by ENISA, in 2010 Slovenia took part as an observer and in 2012
and 2014 as an active participant. Furthermore, from 2013 on, it actively participates in Cyber
Coalition exercises within NATO. Participation in these exercises proved to be a good opportunity to
check the capacities for cyber security assurance at the national level, as well as to exchange
experience and establish new connections between stakeholders. National cyber security exercise
has not yet been carried out.

Vision

Establishing a comprehensive cyber security system as an important integral factor of national
security will contribute to ensuring an open, safe and secure cyberspace, which will make the basis
for smooth functioning of infrastructure, important for state bodies' operations as well as for the life
of each individual.
By 2020, Slovenia will establish an effective cyber security assurance system, which will prevent and
also eliminate the consequences of security incidents. This objective comprises eight sub-objectives:
1.

7.

strengthening and systemic regulation of the national cyber security assurance system;
the safety of citizens in cyberspace;
cyber security in the economy;
ensuring the operation of critical infrastructure in the sector of ICT support;
cyber security to ensure public security and combat cyber crime;
development of cyber defence capabilities;
ensuring the safe operation and availability of key IC systems in the event of major natural and
other disasters;
8. strengthening national cyber security through international cooperation.

Cyberspace risks

In a modern society, practically all social activities depend on ICT systems, and with further
development this dependence is likely to increase. Systems interconnectivity means that the
vulnerability of one may affect the functioning of the other. As it is impossible to ensure complete
security against cyber attacks, abuse, fraud, human and technical errors, and other influences, the
approach used in determining the priority of a particular threat should be based on risk assessment.
In recent years13, an increase in the number of security incidents, advanced targeted attacks,
exposure of ICT infrastructure and the abuse thereof for implementing distributed denial-of-service14

Cyber Security Strategy

have been noted. Individuals are exposed to various online frauds, attempts of abuse of electronic
banking services and malicious code.

4.1 Technological Development
ICT develops extremely quickly, which indeed facilitates new innovative use , new business models
and a variety of development opportunities, while it also requires rapid adaptation of the legislative
and other social frameworks. Development guidelines suggest the implementation of cloud
computing, data-guided economy and mass data, the Internet of Things and innovative collaborative
business models based on them, where the limits of control and accountability for the protection of
personal and other data are blurred or at least poorly defined. In cloud computing, in addition to
ensuring safety and privacy, the quality of service can be questionable as well, since it is based on a
chain of the mutual trust of all stakeholders that form the cloud, rather than on the assessment of
the cloud as a whole. The ubiquitous mobile networks, the Internet of Things and mass data will
increase exposure to security threats at different levels, which cannot be resolved without a systemic
approach to risk management and a sufficiently high level of cyber security assurance.

4.2 The Internet
Considering the important fact that the Internet supports the operation of information and
communication systems in many areas, it must be addressed accordingly and, being a key support
system, also must be suitably protected. The Internet is exposed to risks posed by humans, natural
and other disasters, and technical failures. Special attention should be given to the legislative and
regulatory framework that addresses issues related to the protection of critical infrastructure in the
IC support sector.

4.3 Cyber crime
The European Agenda on Security declares cyber crime to be one of the three threats to European
security. With the increasing growth of widespread ICT use cyber crime, which includes a wide range
of activities, is also on the rise. On the one hand it includes offenses related to intrusions of privacy,
identity theft, obtaining information about individuals and legal entities for the purpose of extortion,
fraud and online scams, dissemination of child pornography, digital piracy, economic espionage,
money laundering, and counterfeiting, while on the other hand, it includes criminal offences related
to attempts to obstruct the functioning of the Internet, ranging from mass-sending of unsolicited emails and implementation of distributed denial-of-services, to cyber terrorism, which may cause
malfunctions of IC infrastructure and systems and may be as a result in some cases even lifethreatening. Means and methods used in cyber crime are also used in more traditional forms of
crime.

4.4 Intelligence
Society’s overbearing dependence on ICT has increased the risks associated with the activities of
foreign intelligence services. Various state or non-state stakeholders may exploit cyberspace to
achieve their objectives, particularly by carrying out cyber-intelligence operations, which my in
certain segments jeopardize the political, security and economic interests of the Republic of Slovenia.

4.5 Changes of the security environment
Malicious hacker intrusions into the information systems of state administration or state bodies also
pose a security risk. Malicious activity against the cyber security of critical infrastructure represents a
form of asymmetric warfare. Such activity is all the more dangerous in connection with increasingly
organised international terrorist networks.

4.6 Intrusions of privacy
In an information society, individuals' privacy increasingly comes under attack, as it must be aligned
with interests regarding retrieval, processing and storage of personal data by different companies for
commercial purposes, as well as by state authorities. It is expected that with the increasing terrorist
threats and the implementation of measures to prevent them trends towards greater control and,
consequently, the restriction of individuals' privacy in the cyberspace will also be on the increase.

5

Identification of stakeholders

Public and private sector organisations participate in the cyber security system. Apart from the
central coordination of the national cyber security assurance system and all the national response
centres, an important role is played by the Electronic Communications Networks and Services Agency
of the Republic of Slovenia (AKOS), telecom operators and telecommunication infrastructure
administrators, information society service providers, academic and research community (some
faculties and research organisations), occupational (chambers of commerce and industry) and
professional associations (Slovenian associations and sections of international association in the area
of information and communication technologies and cyber security), and software vendors that
provide support to national authorities.
In a broader sense, stakeholders in cyber security assurance in Slovenia also include relevant
organisations abroad, especially when these are cooperating with Slovenian stakeholders in response
to security incidents. In this respect, partners within the EU and NATO are particularly important.

6

The establishment of a comprehensive cyber security system and clear
governance structure

Successful high-level cyber security assurance requires the effective use of existing resources and
appropriate multi-level organisation. Slovenia will set up central coordination of the national cyber
security assurance system and provide conditions for its stable operation. This coordination body will

8

Cyber Security Strategy

coordinate the cyber security assurance capabilities at the strategic level to ensure cyber security in
the country at lower levels, and will represent a single point of contact for international cooperation.
The organisation form of coordination functions will be determined by the Government of the
Republic of Slovenia.
At the operational level of cyber security assurance, SI-CERT will operate with its capabilities at the
national level, the Ministry of Defence in the field of defence and protection against natural and
other disasters, the police in ensuring cyber security in the context of public safety and the fight
against cyber crime, SOVA in counter intelligence, and the emergent SIGOV-CERT in public
administration.

Figure 1: Scheme of the cyber security assurance system

The cyber security assurance system will also include other stakeholders. Operators of critical
infrastructure in the private and public sectors are important, particularly in the energy supply sector
(electricity producers and distributors), and in information and communication support (telecom
operators, information society service providers, etc.).
In awareness raising, education and research, the academic and research community will contribute
to the cyber security assurance system through their higher-education programmes and courses on
cyber security at all levels of education, and through the results of research organisations. The

Cyber Security Strategy

9

system will also be open to civil society's initiatives. This applies primarily to initiatives for
improvements and assistance in raising awareness among various target groups by professional
associations (Slovenian associations and the Slovenian sections of international associations in the
field of information and communication technologies and cyber security).

7

The areas of strategy implementation

Strategy implementation will focus on preventing security incidents, responding to security incidents
and increasing awareness of the target groups about the importance of cyber security.

7.1 Prevention
The prevention of security incidents ranges from the technical design of information system
components to providing national and international legal frameworks and regulations that contribute
to the development of safer applications and infrastructure. Furthermore, it should be ensured that
the design of programmes and ICT infrastructure include the safety and protection of individuals'
privacy, and that the standards ensuring safe and smooth operation of the systems, including the use
of encryption solutions, are observed. Risks are assessed, which serves as a basis for the preparation
and implementation of measures to mitigate unacceptable risks, and an analysis of the implemented
measures. The use of open-source technologies that ensure interoperability and allow best possible
control, and which are not partially of fully closed because of patent rights, is encouraged.

7.2 Response
Prevention alone is insufficient for achieving a high level of cyber security. As security incidents can
never be fully eliminated, it is necessary to provide for appropriate mechanisms to respond to them.
It is furthermore important to take account of the experience obtained from the prevention phase,
as well as from the past security incident response events. Experience may come from domestic and
foreign institutions responsible for cyber security assurance, and therefore their best possible
interconnectivity is very important. Based on the experience and analysis of incidents and risks, the
response measures are constantly updated and improved. Active cooperation is also observed in the
preparation of standard cyber crisis response procedures at the international or global level.

7.3 Awareness raising
People are those who develop, build and use ICT. Awareness raising and education may help to
eliminate the risks and build a culture of safe technology use. In the awareness-raising phase, the
experience derived from prevention and response phases must be utilised so that users are
acquainted with actual risks and effective methods of avoiding them. The methods and contents of
awareness raising (programmes) are adjusted to various target groups to the greatest possible
extent. For children and adolescents, cyber security topics are included in the curriculum at different
levels of education. Adjusted awareness-raising programmes for the remaining population and
business entities are developed. The use of encryption solutions, as one of the cornerstones of cyber
security assurance, is encouraged.

Strategy objectives and measures for their achievement

Strategy implementation, which will be based on the upgrade and update of the existing cyber
security system capabilities, will be monitored by the Government of the Republic of Slovenia, the
central coordination of the national cyber security system, and by the relevant ministries, in
accordance with the grounds of jurisdiction set out in the Constitution and legislation.
A number of measures will be carried out to reach the objectives of cyber security. If needed, during
the implementation of the strategy, the measures can be upgraded accordingly.

Table 1: Cyber security strategy objectives and actions needed to achieve them

8.1 Strengthening and systemic regulation of the national cyber security
assurance system
Slovenia will strengthen and upgrade its existing cyber security assurance system, including its
diplomatic and consular network. Due to the increasing volume of security incidents, the existing
capabilities of the response centres are no longer sufficient. In order to ensure the proper response,
the capabilities of the National Response Centre (SI-CERT and the response centre for the needs of
the defence and protection against natural and other disaster (cyber capacities of the Ministry of
Defence) will be strengthened, and an independent response centre for the public administration
systems will be set up (SIGOV-CERT). The framework of strengthening the cyber security assurance
system also included the preparation of a plan to respond to security incidents.
At the strategic level of cyber security assurance system, a central coordination for comprehensive
approach and coordination of activities in all areas of cyber security will be set up. One of the
functions of this coordination will be to act as a single national point of contact for international
cooperation in the area of cyber security.
Also in the future, Slovenia will regularly participate in international exercises on cyber security.
Besides that, it will also carry out exercises at the national level. The content of each exercise will
possibly be consistent with the risk assessment of a specific treat, however, based on the most
realistic scenario possible. At least occasionally, exercises will be carried out with the participation of
all stakeholder engaged in cyber security assurance. Thus, all the mechanisms, the preparedness and
the interaction of participants will be checked. Each exercise will be followed by a detailed analysis of
the results and drafting proposals for any improvements and, if necessary, upgrading or updating the
security incidents response plan.
To achieve the objective of strengthening and systemic regulation of national cyber security
assurance system, the following measures shall be implemented:


establishing a central coordination of the national cyber security assurance system;

 human resource and technological strengthening of bodies at the operative level of cyber security
assurance system along with the implementation of SIGOV-CERT;
 regular participation in international exercises on cyber security and organisation of national
exercises;
 gradual upgrade of state bodies' HKOM networks with equipment that is appropriately approved
by the Slovenian authorities as being safe and suitable for use;

12

Cyber Security Strategy

 implementation of competent checks of safety and functionality of IT equipment within the
existing and newly established bodies.

8.2 The safety of citizens in cyberspace
Each individual must be able to have access to the safest possible use of ICT, while respecting privacy
and human rights. Citizens must have the opportunity to become acquainted with the risks in
cyberspace and means of their control and the associated responsibility of each individual for their
own safety in the global communications network. Cyber security assurance should not
disproportionately infringe on privacy by using excessive measures or means. All the relevant and
interested stakeholders must always be involved in the drafting of the legislation governing
permissible degree of intrusion into the privacy of information in a timely and equitable manner.
Raising user awareness about the importance of cyber security is extremely important, as it
contributes to building or improving the culture of cyber security. Thus, users learn to independently
take care of their own security in cyberspace. Therefore, in addition to further implementation of the
existing awareness programmes, new ones will be developed. Participation in various initiatives to
raise awareness and involve civil society in these activities will be encouraged. Effective outreach will
focus on specific target groups (e.g. children and adolescents, different age groups of citizens,
business entities).
Cyber security topics will be properly included in the curricula of schools at all levels of the education
system. Furthermore, universities should be encouraged (e.g. by increased demand from the
economy) to offer independent study programmes on cyber security. Key stakeholders in cyber
security assurance should ensure the development of competences and certification of personnel
that perform or will perform the tasks of cyber security assurance by continuous training.
To achieve the objective of ensuring citizens’ security in cyberspace, the following two measures will
be taken:
 regular implementation of awareness raising programmes on cyber security;
 introducing contents in the area of cyber security in the education and training programmes.

8.3 Cyber security in the economy
As regards ICT in the economy, Slovenia already has a lot of potential, but with adequately focused
investments in research, development and innovation, further breakthrough is also possible in the
field of cyber security. Cyber security assurance in the economy is particularly important in the
digitalised business and industry environment. The state will co-finance projects and targeted
research in this field, which have the potential of contributing to cyber security. The applicable
results of such projects and research must constantly upgrade the system of cyber security. Likewise
in other areas, also in the area of cyber security the state will promote integration of academic and
research sphere with the economy at both national and international levels. Thus, it will help to
create a critical mass of experts in this field, thereby creating public-private partnerships that will be
able to develop innovative products and services with high added value to domestic and global
markets.

Cyber Security Strategy

13

For its operation, the increasingly digitalised economy should be provided with a secure
communication environment. Therefore, programmes to raise companies’ awareness about the risks
of cyberspace and the secure use of ICT will be continued. In doing so, greater attention will be paid
to the identified critical areas in accordance with the current analyses of the situation. Efforts for the
development and use of standards in cyber security will be promoted.
To achieve the objective of cyber security in the economy, the following two measures will be taken:
 the promotion of development and introduction of new technologies in the field of cyber security;
 regular implementation of awareness raising programmes on cyber security for business entities.

8.4 Providing the operation of critical infrastructure in the sector of ICT support
Critical infrastructure of ICT support sector must be designed and managed so as to provide systemic
ICT support at various levels. The uninterrupted operation of infrastructure must be ensured, which
requires the functioning of internet systems, as well as hardware and software that support critical
functions in the country. Rapid and efficient mechanisms for responding to threats and debugging,
i.e. sanation of damage resulting from security incidents, and preventive mechanisms that as far as
possible prevent such threats and errors, are established. By establishing an independent response
centre for public administration systems (SIGOV-CERT), SI-CERT will be relieved and thus – with
appropriate reinforcement – able to focus attention to providing cyber security in the ICT support
sector.
To achieve the objective of ensuring the operation of critical infrastructure in the sector of ICT
support, the following measure will be taken:
 regular assessment of risks to the operation of the critical infrastructure of the ICT support sector,
planning appropriate protection measures, and updating risk assessment in this field.

8.5 Cyber security assurance to ensure public security and combat cyber crime
Slovenia will develop cyber capabilities that will be able to independently and in cooperation with
other countries protect ICT systems in public security (Schengen, Europol, Interpol) and to provide
support to operational police work. The development of the capabilities of the police and judicial
authorities for combating cybercrime will be accelerated. Greater attention will be paid to the
development of digital forensics and care for adequate qualification of all law enforcement
authorities operating in this area. Knowledge of cybercrime suppression is also important for
successful prosecution of the classic types of crime, as the use of services offered online and other
networks is increasing in performing these activities. In the development of cyber capabilities, the
state will cooperate with industry and academic institutions. In the detection of new forms of cyber
crime and the exchange of information, cooperation of the police with response centres, academic
and research institutions, hardware and software producers as well as with professional associations
in the field of ICT at national and international level will be important. Legislation and procedures in
this area should stay abreast of the rapid development of ICT, and appropriate technical experts
should be involved in their drafting.

Cyber Security Strategy

To achieve the objective of cyber security assurance in the area of public security and combating
cyber crime, the following measures will be taken:
 Implementation of appropriate cyber capacities to protect ICT systems of the police;
 regular training on cyber security for law enforcement authorities participating in the
development of cyber capacities for public security and in combating cyber crime;
 regular updating of the laws and procedures in line with the development of ICT.

8.6 Development of defensive cyber capabilities
Slovenia will develop cyber defence capabilities that will be able to independently and in
cooperation with other EU and NATO countries to protect defence ICT systems and to provide
support to military operations and crisis planning. Slovenia will develop its cyber defence capabilities
independently as well as in cooperation with its EU and NATO partners, while also cooperating with
industry and academic institutions.
To achieve the objective of defence cyber security, the following measure will be taken:
 development of appropriate cyber capabilities to protect defence ICT systems.

8.7 Ensuring safe operation and availability of key ICT systems in the event of
major natural and other disasters
Slovenia is exposed to natural and other disasters15, which may also be large-scale. Therefore, it is
necessary to provide adequate resources and implement measures for ensuring the smooth
operation of ICT systems in all circumstances, even in the event of major natural and other disasters.
Cyber security assurance measures are intended to ensure data integrity as well as the availability,
reliability and security of access to services and data.
To achieve the objective of ensuring safe operation and availability of key ICT systems in the event of
major natural and other disasters the following measure will be taken:
 ensuring conditions for smooth operation of key ICT systems in the event of major natural and
other disasters.

8.8 Strengthening national cyber security through international cooperation
Given the global nature of the Internet and thus also the problems of cyber security, international
cooperation in ensuring cyber security for Slovenia as a small country is indispensable. Such
cooperation facilitates good exchanges of experience, knowledge and best practices, all of which
contribute to the strengthening of national security. Slovenia will therefore continue to promote the
participation of its representatives in international organisations such as the UN, EU, NATO, OSCE,
OECD and ITU, as well as in international professional associations in this field. It will strive for the

development of international standards of operation in cyberspace and for the implementation of
practical confidence-building measures in cooperation with other countries and international
partners. At the international level, Slovenia will take an active part in knowledge transfer in the area
of cyber security.
To achieve the objective of national cyber security with international cooperation, the following
measure will be taken:
 ensuring conditions for the participation of Slovenian experts in the relevant international cyber
security working bodies and associations.

Strategy implementation risks

The greatest risk to the strategy’s implementation is insufficient awareness about the importance of
cyber security assurance, which goes hand in hand with low general security culture, and the lack of
political will and consensus for the systemic regulation of this area at the national level.
Unsystematic development of such an important area as cyber security assurance would entail very
harmful consequences for the state, which would be – in the event of large-scale cyber attacks –
difficult to remedy.
Successful implementation of the strategy will, on the contrary, have a positive impact on the
assurance of national security, with positive multiplicative effects associated with the increased level
of security. It will also have influence on the increase of users' confidence in the Internet and thus
the development of new services and business models associated with its use, which will be reflected
in digital economic growth and greater social welfare.
STRENGTHS

WEAKNESSES

 Operational level of cyber security assurance has
been established.

 Strategic level of cyber security assurance has
not been established.

 Quality though insufficient human resources at
the operational level of the system.

 Lack of resources (financial, human, material and
technical).

 Good results of the preventive measures
(awareness raising programmes) implemented so
far.

 Insufficient cooperation between key
stakeholders.

 Participation in common international exercises.
OPPORTUNITIES
 Increased trust of users (businesses, state
administration, individuals) in the use of the
Internet, which increases its use (B2C, B2B, B2G,
G2C), lowers operating costs and, consequently,
allows digital growth.
 The integration of existing capabilities and the
utilisation of synergies.

 The field lacks a regulatory framework.
THREATS
 Insufficient awareness of the importance of the
area and the associated lack of political will and
consensus for rapid and effective action and
systemic regulation at national level.
 The possibility of system failure in the event of
an increase in security incidents if the system is
not reinforced.

Cyber Security Strategy

Being a strategic document, cyber security strategy has no direct financial implications; it is a guiding
principle of development activities for cyber security assurance. Financial implications will arise with
the implementation of the strategy, which will be limited by the resources available within the
respective applicable state budget, thus having regard to Article 23 of the Budget Implementation
Act, which provides that the amount earmarked for specific expenditure can only be in the amount
specified by the budget. The implementation of the strategy will also be limited by the resources
available within the Operational Programme for the Implementation of the EU Cohesion Policy 2014
– 2020.
