Draft National Cyber Security Policy & Strategy

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

In the early 2000’s, the focus of ICTs in Africa was on expanding Internet access. With the
advent of submarine fiber optics Internet transit, countries within the Africa region have access
to high speed broadband at reasonable prices. The focus on access today is the rollout of
terrestrial fiber optics backbone in countries.
The availability of Internet access means more people today have access to Internet. The
expansion of Internet access has brought with it risks of attack from person with disruptive
tendencies to dupe other Internet users and commit cybercrimes. These disruptive activities by
cyber criminal has cause the debate on cyber security to be on the top of the agenda for almost
every African country and many countries are planning strategies to combat the cyber criminals.
Several Global activities are taking place around the fight against cyber criminals and cyber
security. The ITU’s IMPACT program is providing several member countries early warning
systems on cyber crimes and is helping these member countries secure their cyber space. The
Commonwealth Cyber Initiative (CCI) is another initiative that seeks to help commonwealth
countries adopt efficient cyber security policy and Infrastructure. At the African regional level,
the AU developed a cyber security convention which was ratified by African heads of states last
year.
The cyber menace in Ghana had been more of cyber fraud. The popular “Sakawa” menace
where cyber criminals tend to dupe unsuspecting Internet users from Ghana and abroad of
large sums of money remain prevalent because inadequate laws on cyber crime which does not
help law enforcement properly prosecute cyber criminals. The Electronic Transaction Act
(2008), however, has provisions for law enforcement to fight against cyber crime. However this
not adequate and does not address fully all aspects of cyber security, especially the multistakeholder approach to fighting the cyber menace. Several initiatives are on going to address
the cyber menace and needs to be brought under one umbrella for Ghana.
The Ministry of Communications, Ghana with the support of UN Economic Commission for
Africa (UNECA) began a process in 2011 to review Ghana’s ICT for accelerated Development
(ICT4AD) policy document to include recent developments in ICTs that was not originally
included in the document. Cyber Security is one of the four thematic areas under this review

and the ministry has appointed an Adhoc technical committee and a resource person to develop
a national cyber security policy and strategy for Ghana. This document is the report submitted
by the Adhoc committee on cyber security which outlines the proposed policy and
implementation strategy with specific initiatives to get enforcement of cyber security up and
running in Ghana.

CHALLENGES, DEVELOPMENTS WITH FOCUS OF THE POLICY

i.

Overview

Ghana has had a number of websites defaced by hackers in recent times. The most
recent one being Ghana’s official web portal. Very important websites like the website of
National Communication Authority, the National Information Technology Agency (NITA)
and the website of the vice president of Ghana have all being defaced in recent past.
These attacks have indented the national image of Ghana and indicated a security
weakness of our cyber infrastructure and space.
Since the turn of the century, we have seen the high growth of the Internet in Ghana.
The growth has brought along cyber attacks on various information infrastructure as
well as cyber fraud perpetuated by criminally-minded persons popularly known as
“Sakawa”. The biggest problem is that victims of “Sakawa” and other cyber fraud
activities had often not found an advertised central point in the country to report the
incidences. Even when these incidences had been reported to the Ghana Police
Criminal Investigation Department (CID), it has taken many years to apprehend any
suspect because of the lack of know-how on tracing these criminal using computers –
based investigative skills. Worse of it all, when such cyber criminal were apprehended
and processed to court, there were no sufficient legal bases to prosecute these criminal
as the legal system was not up to date to convict and punish cyber criminals resulting in
Ghana’s image been dented as a cyber crime pronged location.
For many years, cyber cafes have been the main source of Internet access as many
could not afford the high cost of obtaining personal Internet access. However, with the
advent of high speed mobile Internet access via 2.5 to 3.5G modems, many of the cyber
fraud perpetuators are shifting their operations from the cyber cafes to working from
their home and obscure places that are not easily accessible. The cyber cafes are still
used by many cyber fraudsters because the cyber cafe business in Ghana is not
regulated and there are not specific rules guiding their operations.

Ghana’s mobile penetration today stands at over 92% as at July 2012. The high mobile
penetration has brought about an increase in mobile phone threats and fraud. A few
years ago, there were calls from an anonymous caller who started rumors of an
impending earthquake which caused panic and threatened national security. The
Ministry of Communications through the National Communications Authority reacted
swift to mobile phone threats by announcing SIM card registrations which ended
recently bringing some sanity to mobile security.
Until recently, Ghana’s Internet backbone and resources have been largely private
sector driven. Since the advent of Internet in Ghana in the early 90s, the National
Communications Authority has registered over 100 Internet and data service operators.
Government agencies have to buy services from private Internet service operators
which run most of the critical information infrastructure. The result was highly sensitive
government agencies using free email services like Yahoo and Google which expose
these agencies to risk of exposure of sensitive government information. However, since
2008, Ghana has embarked on a massive government network rollout to bring about
efficiency in government operations and citizens engagement through eServices. The
first phase of the eGovernment network project has been completed and handed over to
the National Information Technology Agency which has since July 2011 provided
Internet and Data services to over 100 Ministries Departments and Agencies (MDAs)
The includes project includes a national datacenter which will become the repository of
all government records and information. The Datacenter has enable NITA to provide
email and webhosting services under government designated second level domain
(.gov.gh) and all MDAs are expected to migrate to the platform in the near future to
ensure security of Government sensitive information. NITA is implementing the Public
Key Infrastructure (PKI) and Digital Certificates to enhance secure communication
within government. NITA’s eGovernment network has become critical information
infrastructures which when attacked can adversely affect functioning of government and
will dent the cyber image of Ghana.

Global Activities on Cyber Security

Cyber Security is central to the Information and knowledge economy. Countries which
have high levels of networked computers and automation stand greater risks than
countries with the least developed networked computer infrastructure. As many
countries with leased developed network infrastructure strive to become a knowledge
society, many network infrastructures will be rolled out with automation. This is
evidenced in many African countries where over the last few years, we have seen
massive submarine fiber optic cable Internet transit land on the shores and the massive
in-country fiber optic back bones being rollout. An increase in network computer
infrastructure will bring a proportionate risk to critical information infrastructure.
Since the year 2000, several countries with high levels of networked computers
infrastructure been working around securing their critical information infrastructure and
have developed cyber security policies and strategies to mitigate cyber incidences and
crimes. The United States of America for instance recently revised its policy and
strategy to meet high incidences of cyber attacks and increasing threats of cyber war.
Every cyber citizen (people in cyberspace) has a right to lawfully access to information
from around the globe irrespective of the location of the information. However, many
criminally-minded cyber citizens tend to misuse the grant of access to information and
commit cyber crimes. Since no one country can control cyber space and everyone can
have access to information anywhere it is important that countries to put in place a very
robust security around critical national infrastructure, setup very swift response systems
as risk of attacks cannot be eliminated, and use an international approach of
cooperation to secure cyber space and mitigate cyber crimes.
Many countries have already formed nation Computer Emergency Response Teams
(CERT) where cyber incidences are reported and coordinated actions taken to mitigate
the impact and national emergency response systems to facilitate process of responses
when the security of the nation is in danger by cyber attacks. CERTs have been set in
11 | P a g e

Draft National Cyber Security Policy & Strategy

very few developing nations, although there is much talk about the subject in many
developing countries as networked computers infrastructure expands.
The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) through the International Multilateral
Partnership against Cyber Threat (IMPACT) program has been playing a leadership role
is providing early warning systems and training cyber security experts around the world.
Today, IMPACT has over 142 countries as members. The IMPACT program has been
used to prosecute a global cyber security agenda. ITU has indeed developed frame
work for developing countries to help them kick start a process of developing policies
and strategy around cyber security.
Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams (FIRST) has also been a global
platform of Computer Emergency Response teams in the world. Membership to FIRST
is by recommendation and through testing of operational environment of country
CERTs.
The Budapest Convention on Cyber Security which has been in force since 2004 was
elaborated by the Council of Europe with the participation of Canada, Japan, South
Africa and the USA. The convention is open to any country which wants to participate.
The convention is used as a guideline, reference standard or model law in more than
100 countries.
iii.

Regional Initiatives

Governments in Africa today have moved ICT discussion form infrastructure to cyber
security. A decade ago, infrastructure was a major challenge to many African countries.
Many countries have invested in massive in-country infrastructure and the access
challenge is waning. The networked computer infrastructure coming up in many African
countries has open up cyber space to many more citizens and accompanying this, the
risk of using the Internet. A few countries like Tunisia, South Africa and Kenya already
have a CERT in place. Many countries are also in the process of developing cyber
security policy and strategy (including formation of CERTs). In order to harmonize the
12 | P a g e

Draft National Cyber Security Policy & Strategy

development of cyber security policy and strategy, the Africa Union (AU) and the UN
Economic Commission for Africa (UNECA) have developed a draft cyber security
convention that has been under review over the last few months and is due to be ratified
by African heads of States. Harmonization, it can be argued, will establish regional
cooperation in the fight against cyber crime.
iv.

Local Initiatives

Today’s society thrives virtually on using the Internet for communication and business.
As networked computer infrastructure expands in the country, there is an increasing
threat to business and communication.
Recent several cyber attacks on government websites in Ghana is a wake-up call for
the development of a cyber security policy and strategy. Resolutions of cyber
incidences have been uncoordinated and in many cases, there were no reporting
structure put in place to guide us in dealing with future attacks.
NITA’s concern of ensuring security of the network has forced it to initiate discussion
amongst stakeholder in the Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) to setup a
NITA Computer Emergency Response team (nitaCERT) to coordinate cyber incidences
and assist in resolving future incidences within the government network.
The national Computer Security Incident Response Team (CSIRT) initiative by the
Ministry of Communications and the Commonwealth Cybersecurity Initiative (CCI) is an
ongoing project for the creation of a national CSIRT. A CCI team were in Ghana
recently on the scoping mission to assist Ghana develop a cyber security policy and
strategy and, to help Ghana establish a national CSIRT. During the scoping mission, the
team interviewed over 70 cyber security stakeholder in Ghana and interacted with the
Adhoc Technical committee on the Cyber Security Policy and Strategy.

13 | P a g e

Draft National Cyber Security Policy & Strategy

The National Security Council and many other institutions such as Ghanaian Academic
and Research Network (GARNET) in academia are working on different projects
towards securing cyberspace.
The SIM registration by the National Communication Authority is another initiative to
mitigate cyber crimes committed using mobile phones. The Ghana Police Service has
also put in place the Anti-Fraud Unit to alleviate cyber and other crimes. The Economic
and Organized Crime Office (EOCO) of the Attorney General’s Department and
Financial Intelligence Center for the financial sector are all government initiatives
geared and mitigating crime in general and cyber crime in particular.
On the business side, the opening of an e-crime bureau in Ghana will help organization
investigate cyber crime thoroughly and improve protection of cyber space.
In spite all these initiatives, the fact still remains that a general lack of education on
cyber security amongst the consuming public of ICT products and services which needs
to be addressed.
II. NEED FOR POLICY

As Ghana strives to become, an information and knowledge economy, there is an
increased emphasis on informational activities and information industry. In the
information and knowledge economy, wars will be fought around information token of
countries. Businesses will compete on information and computer systems will work
efficiently on the right information to produce the output required. It is becoming
extremely necessary for nations to protect critical national information that is required to
ensure national security and ensure that the information and knowledge economy
continues to thrive and bring about wealth creation for citizens. As the infrastructure
problems get solved in countries, there is an increase in attacks on networked
computers and the critical information infrastructure that will sustain the economy of the
14 | P a g e

Draft National Cyber Security Policy & Strategy

information and knowledge society. There is therefore an increasing need to protect
critical national information infrastructure (CNII) and create a very robust incidence
response system when any attacked is made on the CNII to avoid loss of revenue due
to down time and ensure national security.
The need to create a culture of security which is absent today due to lack of awareness
of the enormous threats that users of Internet are exposed must be addressed by a
national cyber security policy. Awareness creation of the risks Internet users and other
stakeholders are exposed to can drastically mitigate the risks of cyber attacks and
consequential loss of revenue. This will create a very conducive environment in the
information economy where Ghanaians can create worth in peace without fear of
harassment by cyber criminal and fraudsters.
Government business can be brought to a halt if the NITA infrastructure is attacked. In
the same way, many businesses may grind to a halt if infrastructure of ISPs and other
public Internet and phone services are attacked. There is therefore the need to develop
technical capacity of local technocrats to enable them manage the cyber security risks
to government and private sector critical information infrastructure. In order to share
knowledge on incidence response and ensure that there is a uniform risk management
of all critical information infrastructures (both public and private), the policy must
address the need for a central coordinating body and work with a public private
partnership model.
III. RELEVANT PROVISION – ICT4AD
Pillar 14 of the ICT4AD policy relates to Security Agencies using ICT for combating
cybercrime. The pillar among other things emphasis on capacity building, international
cooperation and building infrastructure for security agencies to enable them use ICT to
combat crime and also ensure that the legal text of the policy pillar is up to date to help
security agencies prosecute any cyber crime offenders by the Attorney General’s office.

15 | P a g e

Draft National Cyber Security Policy & Strategy

The Electronic Transaction Act (ETA) 2008 has specific legislation on cyber crime and
prescribes punishment for cyber crime perpetuators. The Act addresses issues on the
fight against cyber crime.
The Data Protection Act which has been passed by the Parliament of Ghana ensures
protection of private data of government, citizens and businesses in Ghana.
The Pillar 14 and the ETA fails to capture a holistic approach to securing the cyber
space as a means of mitigating cyber incidences that may affect the ability of citizens to
create worth.
The several on-going initiatives which are not coordinated makes it impossible to know
what different agencies of Government, Academia and business are doing to enhance
cyber security. A National Cyber Security framework covering policy and
implementation strategy done holistically will ensure coordination and greatly enhance
the national cyber security of Ghana.

Draft National Cyber Security Policy & Strategy

I.

INTRODUCTION

Ghana’s determination of securing its cyber space is driven by a desire to ensure that
our people are free from cyber attacks with devastating effects. This is informed by the
fact that a people with a culture of cyber security achieved through awareness creation
and capacity building are in a better position to handle cyber attacks as and when they
occur. Our ability to identify and understanding threats and how they can be handled
reduces the number of actual attacks significantly and enhances the continuous
operation of the national infrastructure on which critical information are held in the
interest and security of the nation. Our desire also recognizes that the threat is not
restricted only to government but also to operators who provide public services to the
citizens and private networks and looks to ensure that ally effort to ensure cyber
security must be a private public partnership.

V.

MISSION STATEMENT

Our mission is to determine, analyze and address the immediate cyber security threats
posed on identified critical national information infrastructure by providing adequately
protection for the critical national information infrastructure and over time become a self
sufficient country attending to its cyber security needs.
VI.

POLICY SCOPE

This policy covers various aspect of cyber security including fight against cyber security,
national security, legal measures, law enforcement and protection of critical national
information infrastructure.
VII.

POLICY CONTEXT

Ghana, like many countries in Africa faces the risk of cyber attacks. Different
uncoordinated initiatives are being put in place to secure the cyber space of Ghana.
Many custodians of critical national information infrastructure are unaware of their roles
in ensuring the maintenance of cyber security within the country. In Africa, Governments
are discussing how to secure their cyberspace in the wake of heightened threats to

20 | P a g e

Draft National Cyber Security Policy & Strategy

national information infrastructure. Several national initiatives are taking place to ensure
that legal systems are updated to enable proper persecution of cyber criminals.
The threat that cyber attacks pose to African governments has prompted the African
Union Commission to develop a draft convention under discussion at the regional level
to harmonize the efforts of African countries in fighting cyber crime.
The cyber security policy will address major cyber risks facing Ghana from attacks on
the national information infrastructure. The policy seeks to address the lack of
awareness of risks users and businesses face doing business in cyber space. The
problem of “Sakawa” which has tarnished Ghana’s cyber credentials as a haven of
cyber fraudster will be addressed by the policy. The policy also addresses the need to
develop technology framework for combating cyber attacks and capacity building for
cyber security expects to make Ghana self –sufficient in the fight against cyber crime
and in the near future create a culture of cyber security in Ghana.
The National Cyber Security Policy (NCSP) seeks to address the risks to the Critical
National Information Infrastructure (CNII) which comprises the networked information
systems of ten critical sectors.
The policy recognizes the critical and highly interdependent nature of the CNII and aims
to develop and establish a comprehensive program and a series of frameworks that will
ensure the effectiveness of cyber security controls over vital assets. It is being
developed to ensure that the CNII are protected to a level that commensurate the risks
faced.
The policy has been designed to facilitate Ghana’s move towards a knowledge-based
economy and will be based on a number of frameworks that comprises legislation and
regulatory, technology, public-private cooperation, institutional, and international
aspects.

Assist MOC to collation of all cyber security initiatives
• Identifying critical national information infrastructure in
sectors as defined by the policy
• Support policy drivers to setup structures for medium
term strategy
• Design and implement a comprehensive National
Cyber Security Awareness program
National Security, Law and other and enhanced cyber Security
•

In order to have continuous activity on the Cyber security policy
and strategy, it is proposed that the current Adhoc technical
committee for cyber security be converted to a Working Group
(WG) to keep the momentum of the cyber security agenda to
ensure a quick implementation of the policy and strategy.
The National Cyber Security Policy WG (NSCPWG) will be
made up of current policy drafting Adhoc technical committee
which composition represent a public private collaboration and
by virtue of the selection of the members, also represent a
bottom-up approach. New members may be added to
overcome any shortfall in skill such as legal in the conversion.
The NCSPWG will assist the ministry of communication in the
establishment of recommended specific programs that require
immediate attention such as the awareness campaign for the
first year of the policy.
The rationale for the setting up of WG is to avoid any vacuum
between the adoption of the policy and the implementation of

the long term structures of the policy as well as begin a process
of awareness creation.
• Support implementing agency to begin actual
implementation of strategy
• Develop a National Awareness Creation Program on
Cyber Security including the creation of Nation Cyber

stakeholders. The program will include a cyber security
awareness portal that will establish a permanent awareness
campaign on the internet
The rationale for the setting up the Awareness Campaign is that
an aware community is able to foresee any possible attack and
take appropriate preventive measure to overcome such attacks.
The campaign will be targeted at main stakeholders and the
general public to help develop culture of cyber security.
• To develop a level of awareness in the community to
mitigate risk of cyber attacks by workshops, mass
media and other awareness programs
• Develop a National Awareness portal for easy access
to information on cyber security and easily downloads
for quick fixes
On-going program. In the first year, it is proposed that the
National Cyber Security Policy WG begin work on the program
and hand over to the emerging organization that will be
responsible for ensuring that the country attains a level of
awareness to mitigate cyber incidences.
