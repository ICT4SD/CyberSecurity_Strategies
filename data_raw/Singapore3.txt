PRIME MINISTER'S
FOREWORD

Singapore is an international centre of exchange and
commerce. We must always be open to new technologies
and know-how, in order to connect ideas, economies and
cultures across the world.
Digitally, Singapore is one of the most connected
nations in the world. We have long embraced infocomm
technologies for economic and social development.
Today, we have more phone lines than people. Almost all
households have high-speed broadband Internet access.
However, reliance on infocomm technologies also makes us vulnerable.
Cyber threats and attacks are becoming more sophisticated, with more severe
consequences. We cannot take cybersecurity for granted.
The Cybersecurity Strategy outlines Singapore’s vision, goals and priorities.
We are determined to protect essential services from cyber threats, and to create a
secure cyberspace for businesses and communities. The Cyber Security Agency
of Singapore will take the lead, and work with other agencies and private sector
partners to achieve this.
The Government cannot do it alone. Businesses are responsible for protecting
customers’ personal data. Individuals need to practise good cyber hygiene
to keep personal devices and data safe. If we each do our part to use our
systems and devices responsibly, then collectively we can help to protect
Singapore’s cyberspace.
Cyber attackers do not respect jurisdictions. All countries, especially highlyconnected ones like Singapore, benefit from international cooperation in securing
global infocomm infrastructures and responding to cyber threats. Singapore will
work closely with other countries to build consensus in cyber norms, strengthen
capacity and address cyber threats and crimes.

SINGAPORE'S CYBERSECURITY
STRATEGY AT A GLANCE
Singapore’s Cybersecurity Strategy
aims to create a resilient and trusted
cyber environment. This will enable us
to realise the benefits of technology and
so secure a better future for Singaporeans.
Four pillars underpin our strategy.
We will strengthen the resilience of
Critical Information Infrastructures
(CIIs). We will mobilise businesses and
the community to make cyberspace safer,
by countering cyber threats, combating
cybercrime and protecting personal data.

Building a
Resilient
Infrastructure
OUR STRATEGY:

We will develop a vibrant cybersecurity
ecosystem comprising a skilled workforce,
technologically-advanced companies and
strong research collaborations, so that it
can support Singapore’s cybersecurity
needs and be a source of new economic
growth. Finally, given that cyber threats
do not respect sovereign boundaries,
we will step up efforts to forge strong
international partnerships.

Creating
a Safer
Cyberspace
OUR STRATEGY:

“Cybersecurity is a team effort, everyone has a part to play, and everyone
has to play their part. The Government will take the lead to spearhead
initiatives to enhance Singapore’s cybersecurity stance, and we will need
everyone’s cooperation to reap long term benefits for the cyber ecosystem.
We aim to build a Smart Nation – one that will be enabled by trustworthy
infrastructure and technology.”
Minister-in-charge of Cybersecurity, Dr Yaacob Ibrahim,
GovernmentWare 2015

Developing
a Vibrant
Cybersecurity
Ecosystem
OUR STRATEGY:

To secure our digitally-enabled economy and society,
the Government will work with key stakeholders –
private sector operators and the cybersecurity community
– to strengthen the resilience of our CIIs.

Cyber technology can enable and empower business
and society, but only if it is safe and trustworthy.
A safer cyberspace is the collective responsibility of the
Government, businesses, individuals and the community.

Cybersecurity is both an imperative and an
opportunity. With advanced infrastructure and
a highly-skilled IT workforce, Singapore is wellpositioned to build a vibrant cybersecurity ecosystem.

First, we will enhance our CII Protection Programme to
establish robust and systematic cyber risk management
processes across all critical sectors. Second, we will
improve our sectors’ response and recovery plans to
breaches. We will mount multi-sector cybersecurity
exercises to test cooperation across multiple sectors and
address inter-dependencies during major cyber-attacks.
We will also expand and beef up national resources such
as the National Cyber Incident Response Team (NCIRT)
and the National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC). Next, we
will introduce the Cybersecurity Act to give the Cyber
Security Agency of Singapore (CSA) greater powers to
secure our CIIs. Finally, as threats to government networks
will continue to grow, we will expand efforts to secure
government systems and networks, so as to protect
citizens’ and official data.

First, to effectively deal with the threat of cybercrime,
the Government will implement the recently launched
National Cybercrime Action Plan. Second, we will
enhance Singapore’s standing as a trusted hub by
fostering a trusted data ecosystem. We will work
with global institutions, other governments, industry
partners and Internet Service Providers to quickly
identify and reduce malicious traffic on our Internet
infrastructure. Finally, communities and business
associations can play their part by fostering their
members’ understanding of cybersecurity issues
and promoting the adoption of good practices.

First, the Government will collaborate with industry
partners and Institutes of Higher Learning (IHLs)
to grow the cybersecurity workforce, including
encouraging existing cybersecurity professionals to
deepen their skills. Second, we will develop strong
companies and nurture local start-ups to ensure that
best-in-class solutions are available locally. There
are also opportunities for cybersecurity companies
to leverage Singapore’s traditional strengths in areas
such as financial and infocomm services to develop
exportable solutions. Third, we will foster closer
partnerships between academia and industry so as
to harness cybersecurity R&D in a more targeted
manner to deliver effective solutions. With skilled
professionals, technologically-advanced companies
and strong research collaborations, Singapore can be
at the global forefront of cybersecurity innovation and
create economic opportunities for Singaporeans and
the industry.

INTRO

Strengthening
International
Partnerships
OUR STRATEGY:

Cybersecurity is a global issue. Cyber threats do not
respect sovereign boundaries; indeed, jurisdictional
gaps are exploited to the cyber-attacker’s advantage.
Cyber-attacks disrupting one country can have
serious spill-over effects on other countries as our
inter-dependencies have increased through trade
and global financial markets.
Singapore is committed to strong international
collaboration in cybersecurity for our collective global
security. Singapore will actively cooperate with the
international community, particularly ASEAN, to
address transnational cybersecurity and cybercrime
issues. We will champion cyber capacity building
initiatives, and facilitate exchanges on cyber norms and
legislation. Through international consensus, agreement,
and cooperation, we can make cyberspace a safer and
more secure place for all.

INTRODUCTION
“Cybersecurity is important for Singapore given our high dependence
on information technology and the Internet, and cybercrime is also
growing. Cyber-attacks can take many forms and come from many
sources. They range from defacements of website and data theft,
often by persons who hide behind the anonymity of cyberspace [and]
can also include systemic threats”
Deputy Prime Minister Teo Chee Hean,
Committee of Supply, 6 Mar 2013

Cyber-attacks are increasingly frequent, sophisticated
and impactful. Globally, we have seen a surge in the
number of cyber incidents, such as ransomware, cyber
theft, banking fraud, cyber espionage and disruptions to
Internet services. Attacks on systems that run utility plants,
transportation networks, hospitals and other essential
services are more frequent. Successful attacks result in
disruptions which could cripple economies, and lead to
loss of life.
 
The advent of the Internet of Things will further
increase the attack surface. Left unchecked, malicious
entities can find more ways to launch attacks, steal data
and make cyberspace dangerous for all. The result is a
cyberspace that is hostile, and where basic interactions
and transactions cannot be trusted.
 
Singapore has consistently taken cyber threats seriously
and developed timely responses. Our cybersecurity
journey started a decade ago with the first Infocomm
Security Masterplan in 2005. The Masterplan was a
coordinated effort to secure Singapore’s digital environment
and strengthen public sector cybersecurity capabilities.
Since then, Singapore’s cybersecurity capabilities have
grown. With the formation of the Singapore Infocomm
Technology Security Authority (SITSA) in 2009, we
developed the capability to coordinate national-level
responses against large-scale cyber-attacks, particularly
against our critical information infrastructures.

Our
Smart
Nation
Journey

INTRO

In 2015, the Cyber Security Agency of Singapore
(CSA) was formed as the central agency to oversee
and coordinate all aspects of cybersecurity for the
nation. CSA is empowered to develop and enforce
cybersecurity regulations, policies, and practices.
 
While much has been achieved so far, the threats have
also become more sophisticated. We are even more
dependent on digital technology, especially as we
develop a Smart Nation of digitally-enabled businesses
and lives. Cybersecurity, beyond a necessity to defend
and protect, is also an enabler for our future economy
and society.
 
This Strategy is a statement of Singapore’s vision
and priorities for cybersecurity. It aims to catalyse
participation by all stakeholders - government
agencies, the cyber industry, professionals and
students, academia and researchers, and providers
of essential services. Together, we will ensure the
resilience of our national infrastructure and a safer
cyberspace, supported by a vibrant ecosystem that
provides good jobs and economic opportunities for
Singaporeans. It also signals Singapore’s willingness
to forge strong partnerships with the international
community to combat the transnational nature of
cyber threats.  

Singapore is transforming to become
a Smart Nation, where Singaporeans
are empowered by technology to lead
meaningful and fulfilling lives, where
digital connectivity leads to stronger
community bonds, and where the
power of networks, data and
infocomm technologies is harnessed
to create economic opportunities.

Smart Nation is a whole-of-nation
rallying call for citizens, companies,
and government agencies to work handin-hand to seize the many possibilities
of digital technology. We are putting in
place the necessary infrastructure and
policies to build capabilities, and to create
a conducive ecosystem where people and
companies co-create innovative solutions
to enhance the lives of our citizens. 

OUR CYBERSECURITY
JOURNEY SO FAR

2005 Infocomm Security Masterplan (ISMP)
(2005-2007)
The Info-communications Development
Authority (IDA) launched Singapore’s first
Infocomm Security Masterplan to coordinate
cybersecurity efforts across the Government.
A key priority was building basic capabilities
within the public sector to mitigate and respond
to cyber threats.
2008 Infocomm Security Masterplan
(2008-2012)
The second Masterplan focused especially on
the security of Singapore’s CIIs, with a vision of
making Singapore a ‘Secure and Trusted Hub’.
2009 Singapore Infocomm Technology
Security Authority (SITSA)
SITSA was established under the Ministry of
Home Affairs (MHA) to safeguard Singapore
against cyber-attacks and cyber-espionage.
SITSA’s responsibilities as a national specialist
authority included overseeing the preparation
and securing of CIIs against cyber threats.
2013 National Cyber Security Masterplan
(NCSM2018)
The third Masterplan expanded to cover the
wider infocomm ecosystem, which includes
businesses and individuals, in addition to
the previous focus on CIIs. It sought to make
Singapore a ‘Trusted and Robust Infocomm Hub’.
2013 National Cybersecurity R&D (NCR)
Programme
The National Cybersecurity R&D Programme
was established in October 2013 to develop
R&D expertise and capabilities in cybersecurity
for Singapore. It aims to improve the
trustworthiness of cyber infrastructure, with
emphasis on security, reliability, resilience and
usability. It is now co-managed by the National
Research Foundation and the Cyber Security
Agency of Singapore.

2015 Cyber Security Agency of Singapore
(CSA)
CSA was established under the Prime Minister’s
Office (PMO) and is managed administratively
by the Ministry of Communications and
Information (MCI). With its formation, all
agencies and initiatives related to cybersecurity
– the Singapore Computer Emergency Response
Team (SingCERT), national cybersecurity
master-planning and development functions
from IDA, and SITSA – were brought under
a single agency.
CSA is dedicated to the development of
cybersecurity, protection of CIIs and essential
services, and coordination of national efforts
against large-scale cyber incidents. CSA
is also empowered to develop and enforce
cybersecurity regulations, policies, and practices.
It will coordinate efforts across government,
industry, academia, businesses and the people
sector, as well as internationally.
2015 Cybercrime Command
The Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA)
established the Cybercrime Command as
a unit within the Criminal Investigation
Department (CID) of the Singapore Police
Force (SPF). The Command works closely with
other law enforcement agencies and industry
stakeholders, including the INTERPOL Global
Complex for Innovation (IGCI) located in
Singapore, to investigate cybercrimes.
2016 National Cybercrime Action
Plan (NCAP)
The NCAP was launched by the Ministry
of Home Affairs (MHA) in July 2016. The
plan spells out the priorities needed in the
fight against cybercrime. These include
a) the need for public education on staying
safe in cyberspace; b) the development of
capabilities to fight cybercrime; c) strengthening
cybercrime laws; and d) building local and
international partnerships.

2014 National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)
The NCSC was formed as part of SITSA, to
maintain cyber situational awareness, correlate
cybersecurity events across sectors, and
coordinate with the respective lead agencies to
provide a national-level response to large-scale,
cross-sector cyber incidents.

CHAPTER 1

A

RESILIENT
INFRASTRUCTURE

The Government will work with key stakeholders - the CII operators
and the cybersecurity community - in four major areas.
We will:
Step up the protection of our essential services. We will implement
a CII Protection Programme which emphasises robust and systematic
cyber risk management processes, and the importance of a culture
of cyber risk awareness across all levels of CII organisations. We will
increase the adoption of Security-by-Design practices to address
cybersecurity issues upstream and along the supply chain.
Enhance our capability to respond decisively to cyber threats.
We will enhance our national cyber situational awareness and
conduct regular multi-sector cybersecurity exercises with more
complex scenarios and involving more and more sectors. We will
build up more National Cyber Incident Response Teams (NCIRT)
and enhance the Disaster Recovery Plans (DRP) and Business
Continuity Plans (BCP) of the critical sectors.

Behind the scenes, in every city (and Singapore is no exception),
a gamut of essential services and infrastructure are needed to
keep a modern metropolis running smoothly. Essential services
such as energy, banking, healthcare and transport are powered
by infocomm technology. Cyber-attacks on these Critical Information
Infrastructures (CIIs) can interfere with these essential services.
At best, they lead to inconveniences. At worst, they can result in
significant disruptions to the economy and to our society.
The effects of a cyber-attack on Singapore have ramifications beyond
our shores. Singapore is an open economy and connected to the rest
of the world. It is a major international centre for trade, finance and
logistics. A cyber-attack on Singapore could potentially impact the
wider regional and global economy.
Singapore has to ensure that its CIIs are not just resilient against
physical threats, but also against cyber threats. A cyber-resilient
infrastructure will provide peace of mind to Singaporeans.
A cyber-resilient infrastructure will reinforce confidence in Singapore
as a resilient and trusted global centre of trade and commerce.

Strengthen our cybersecurity governance and legislative
framework. We will introduce a new Cybersecurity Act that will
require CII owners and operators to take responsibility for securing
their systems and networks. The Act will also facilitate the sharing
of cybersecurity information with and by CSA, and empower CSA
and sector regulators to work closely with affected parties to resolve
cybersecurity incidents in a timely manner.
Make Government systems more secure. The Government will
expand its efforts to secure its systems and networks. This includes
allocating 8 per cent of the total Government ICT expenditure to
cybersecurity. We will also reduce the attack surface of Government
systems, enhance cyber situational awareness in the government
sector and sharpen cyber incident management.

SINGAPORE’S
CRITICAL INFORMATION
INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS

The reliable supply of essential services depends on the security of the
computer and network infrastructure in Singapore’s Critical Information
Infrastructure (CII) sectors. Today, we have identified 11 CII sectors,
which cut across utilities, transport, and services.
 
Cyber-attacks on Singapore’s CIIs may have spill-over effects regionally
and globally. As an international financial, shipping and aviation hub,
Singapore also houses critical systems that transcend national borders,
such as global payment systems, port operations systems, and air-traffic
control systems. Successful attacks on these supra-national CIIs can have
disproportionate effects on the trade and banking systems beyond
Singapore’s shores.
 
The Singapore Government is working with the operators of our CIIs
to ensure they remain resilient in the face of cyber-attacks.

SERVICES
Singapore is a major financial centre that processes massive amounts
of transactions every second. For example, our local inter-bank
payment systems handle millions of transactions totalling trillions
of dollars annually. Many of our public services – government
transactions, healthcare, emergency services – are increasingly reliant
on complex underlying computer systems to serve millions of users
each year. The Government Technology Agency (GovTech), Ministry
of Home Affairs (MHA), MOH Holdings (the holding company of
Singapore’s public healthcare entities), Info-communications Media
Development Authority (IMDA) and the Monetary Authority of
Singapore (MAS) are committed to strengthening the cybersecurity
of the systems delivering government and emergency services,
healthcare, media, and banking and financial services.

CHAPTER 1

UTILITIES
Power, water and telecommunications
are the lifeline of modern cities.
In particular, the failure of power
and telecommunications services can
bring other services to a grinding halt.
The Energy Market Authority
(EMA), Public Utilities Board (PUB)
and Info-communications Media
Development Authority (IMDA) will
work closely with the private operators
delivering these services to raise
their cybersecurity posture and ensure
the reliability of these services.

TRANSPORT
Singapore is an international logistics hub. The
Singapore Port and Changi Airport are among the
world’s busiest. The Port is a major transhipment hub
that handles more than 130,000 vessels and 30 million
containers each year. The Airport sees more than
340,000 flights, 55 million travellers, and 1.8 million
tons of cargo annually. Our public transport system
handles 7.5 million passenger trips per day. The Land
Transport Authority (LTA), Maritime and Port Authority
(MPA) and Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore
(CAAS) have put in place governance frameworks and
are building cybersecurity capability to ensure that our
transport and logistics systems are robust.

CHAPTER 1

11

PROTECT OUR
ESSENTIAL SERVICES

Operators increasingly rely on computer networks and the Internet
to maintain essential services and to serve their businesses and
consumers. For CII operators, the gain in efficiency and productivity
is significant – but so are the increased vulnerabilities of essential
services to cyber disruption.
 
To ensure the continuous delivery of essential services, CII operators
need both physical resilience and cyber resilience. Cyber resilience
is the ability of our CIIs to withstand cyber-attacks, allowing them
to continue operating under the toughest conditions and recover
quickly after a disruption. We must raise the cyber resilience of our
essential services, and we can achieve this only with the trust and
participation of all stakeholders – the Government, CII operators,
and the cybersecurity community.
 
Singapore will:
Implement across all critical sectors, a CII Protection Programme
with robust and systematic cyber risk management processes.
A key part of the CII Protection Programme is to grow a culture
of cyber risk awareness across all levels of a CII organisation.
From the CEO to the employee, cybersecurity must be seen
as a business concern and not just one for the IT department.
Pre-empt cyber vulnerabilities by going upstream and
promoting Security-by-Design practices. Cybersecurity
will no longer be an afterthought, but will be consciously
implemented throughout the lifecycle of technology systems.

Implement CII Protection Programme
The Government will roll out a holistic CII Protection Programme
for government agencies and CII operators. It will build on the
Cybersecurity Readiness Maturity Assessment programme
implemented in 2012, which has enabled agencies and operators
identify areas for improvement.
 
The CII Protection Programme will, firstly, establish the foundation
to facilitate information exchange among CII operators through clear
policies and guidelines. Second, it will enable targeted and systematic
improvements through clearer  measurements of governance
maturity and networks’ cybersecurity hygiene. Third, it will require
operators to foster a culture of cyber-risks literacy across all levels in
organisations, proactively address cyber-risks and ensure that their
practices are consistent with policies. With a deep understanding of
cyber risks, sectors take ownership and provide management focus to
implement effective CII protection plans that are tailored to the unique
circumstances of each sector.
 
The goal is for all critical sectors to establish robust and systematic
cyber risk management processes and capabilities that are effective
against the evolving cyber threats.

Systematic Cyber Risk Management
A systematic cyber risk management framework comprises:
1

thorough identification and prioritisation of cyber risks and CIIs through
risk assessments, vulnerability assessments and system reviews;

2

well-informed and conscious trade-offs in security, cost and functionality,
decided at management levels of appropriate seniority;

3

sound systems and procedures to mitigate and manage these risks,
including disaster recovery and business continuity plans;

4

effective implementation that encompasses awareness building and
training across the organisation; and

5

continuous measurement of performance through process audits and
cybersecurity exercises.

Cybersecurity Maturity Assessment
The Government has been using the Readiness Maturity Index (RMI) framework
to assess the readiness of CII sectors in terms of their capabilities for risk-based
mitigation, early detection of threats, and robustness of the response measures.
The RMI is the metaphorical health check that directs the CII sectors’ effort to
manage cyber risks, and facilitates the development of action plans to improve
governance and procedures.

Promote Security-by-Design

Why is Security-by-Design
important?

Security-by-Design is an approach in the system development
lifecycle process to ensure that our applications and systems are
built, deployed, maintained, upgraded and disposed of securely.
The Government will promote the adoption of Security-by-Design
in several ways:
 
Progressively institutionalise Security-by-Design into the
governance framework for CII protection;
Promote the practice of penetration testing to discover
vulnerabilities early for remediation at the design stage;
Build a strong community of practice in product and system
testing based on established international standards, such as
the Common Criteria product assurance certification; and
Continue to refine methodologies and develop new security
validation tools to improve the efficacy of Security-by-Design.

Opening of the CREST Examination
Facility  for Penetration Testing Certifications
and Accreditations at the Singapore Institute
of Technology
The implementation of Security-by-Design
has to be complemented with highly skilled
professionals who can carry out security
validation processes rigorously and proficiently.
The introduction of CREST penetration testing
certifications and accreditations in Singapore
is one means of raising the professional
competency standards.

Security-by-design is a best practice
to ensure that system is developed
with security consideration upfront and
throughout its lifecycle. By integrating
risk assessment into the system
development lifecycle, trade-offs between
security, cost and functionality are
deliberated. The trade-off decisions should
be made by well-informed management at
the appropriate level of decision making.
This ensures that the system is optimised
for the conditions in which it is to be used.
Subscribing to Security-by-Design will
reduce piecemeal implementation and
the need for costly and often ineffective
retrofitting. Cybersecurity, when
thoughtfully considered and incorporated
at the design stage of a system will result
in an organically robust system design
that can better withstand cyber threats.

Designing cybersecurity into FinTech
The Monetary Authority of Singapore
(MAS) has formed a Financial Technology
& Innovation Group since August 2015
to drive the Smart Financial Centre
initiatives. This Group is responsible
for formulating regulatory policies and
1

Centre is therefore
to continually
strengthen
the industry’s
cybersecurity.”

developing strategies to facilitate the use
of technology and innovation to enhance
efficiency and better manage risks in the
financial sector. Efforts by MAS to manage
risks associated with FinTech include:

Establishing a FinTech Innovation Lab that allows stakeholders to experiment with
FinTech solutions, including security solutions;
Establishing “regulatory sandboxes” that can be used to carve out a safe and
conducive space to experiment with FinTech solutions, and where the consequences
of failure can be contained; and
Providing financial support through the Financial Sector Technology & Innovation
scheme for projects that uplift the cybersecurity ecosystem in Singapore.

CHAPTER 1

15

RESPOND DECISIVELY
TO CYBER THREATS
An effective cyber defence must assume that
there can and will be successful cyber-attacks.
When such attacks materialise, the cyber
defenders must be able to mount a robust response
and implement reliable recovery plans. This can
only be possible with a comprehensive framework
for preparedness.
 
Singapore has developed a national cybersecurity
response plan which allows for timely response
and ground initiative at the local level,
complemented with effective coordination and
strategic support at the sectoral and national
level. The plan envisages three tiers of response –
Tier 1 for cyber campaigns that threaten national
security, Tier 2 for cyber-attacks on a sector, and
Tier 3 for cyber-attacks on a specific operator.
The plan requires CSA to work closely with CII
operators and the cybersecurity community
to ensure an effective response.

Integration of Threat Discovery,
Analysis and Incident Response
The National Cyber Security Centre (NCSC)
monitors and analyses the cyber threat landscape
to maintain cyber situational awareness and
anticipate future threats. In the event of large-scale
cyber incidents involving multiple sectors, NCSC
coordinates with the sector regulators to provide
a national level response and facilitate quick alerts
to cross-sector threats.
The Government is investing in technologies
and systems that will strengthen and integrate
the NCSC’s three key functions of threat discovery,
threat analysis and incident response. This will
enable faster threat discovery and operational
response for cross-sector cyber incidents.

16

CHAPTER 1

The national response to a cyber-attack will
be led by an inter-agency Cybersecurity Crisis
Management Group, or CMG (Cyber). It is led
by the Permanent Secretary of the Ministry
of Communications & Information, supported
by CSA, and comprises senior policy decisionmakers from government agencies overseeing
the different critical sectors. CMG (Cyber)
serves dual functions: (a) it is responsible for
the development of cybersecurity policies and
standards, and oversees the implementation
of cybersecurity protection measures in the
critical sectors; and (b) in a cyber crisis, it
mobilises the necessary resources and directs
the operational responses to provide
a coordinated response to the threat.

More Comprehensive
Cybersecurity Exercises
Cybersecurity exercises are important ways
to raise the readiness of sectors, build incident
response plans and capabilities, and improve
communication and coordination between the
CII operators and government agencies. The
Government will conduct these cybersecurity
exercises at both the sector and national levels.
 
Sector exercises will run with more complex
scenarios and more sophisticated attack methods.
This will enhance the capability of the sectoral
cyber response teams and the quality of incident
management by the C-suite decision-makers in
the CII operators.
 
National-level exercises will encompass more
and more sectors, with an emphasis on the interdependent nature of essential services. This will
facilitate the discovery and mitigation of the
sectors’ inter-dependencies, and stress-test the
coordination and communication capabilities at
the national level.

Singapore will:
Enhance its national cyber situational
awareness by integrating threat discovery,
analysis and incident responses.
Conduct regular multi-sector cybersecurity
exercises with more complex scenarios
and involving more and more sectors.
Through these exercises, we aim to
identify vulnerabilities due to cross-sector
interdependencies and stress-test coordination
and communication across sectors.
Build up more National Cyber Incident
Response Teams (NCIRT) which can be
mobilised to lend support to a sector or CII
operator should they face an escalating
cyber incident.
Strengthen the Disaster Recovery Plans
(DRP) and Business Continuity Plans (BCP)
of essential services, especially against
a cyber-attack.

Expand the National Cyber Incident
Response Team (NCIRT)
National Cyber Incident Response Teams
(NCIRT) are currently drawn from the incident
response teams from CSA, Government
Technology Agency (GovTech), the Ministry of
Home Affairs (MHA) and the Ministry of Defence
(MINDEF). They are part of the Tier 1 and Tier 2
response under the national cyber response plan. 
 
The Government will further enhance the
capability of the NCIRTs to deal with more
complex and challenging attack scenarios.
It will also build up more NCIRTs by upgrading
certain sectoral CIRTs and also consider raising
additional NCIRTs from industry and academia.
This will increase the national capacity to deal
with large scale cyber-attacks.

Exercise Cyber Star
Over the past years, the Government has
conducted sector level exercises to exercise
individual critical sectors in their readiness
and incidence response plans against a cyberattack. This culminated in Exercise Cyber Star,
a multi-sector exercise conducted by CSA in
March 2016. It brought together industry and
Government representatives across the infocomm,
Government, energy, and banking and finance
sectors to exercise the response to a nationwide
attack. The exercise was a milestone in building
up cybersecurity readiness and validating the
effectiveness of cross-sector cooperation.

Recover, Restore, Remediate
Resilience in essential services is especially
applicable to CIIs, as a cyber-breach realistically
cannot be prevented all the time. A resilient system
will need to put in place prevention activities that
must be integrated with an expedient incident
response plan and a comprehensive recovery
strategy to mitigate the effects of cyber incidents.
As such, an important aspect following a cyberattack is to be able to return affected CIIs to normal
operations as soon as possible, or to facilitate their
continued operations in sub-optimal conditions
through a prolonged attack. The Government will
work with the sectors to ensure that robust Disaster
Recovery Plans (DRP) and Business Continuity
Plans (BCP) are built into their CII protection plans.

CHAPTER 1

17

STRENGTHEN GOVERNANCE
AND
LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK
The Cybersecurity Act
The Government will introduce a new Cybersecurity Act. This new legislation will equip
CSA with the necessary powers to effectively address increasingly sophisticated threats
to national cybersecurity.
The new Cybersecurity Act will establish a comprehensive framework for the prevention
and management of cyber incidents, and complement the existing Computer Misuse and
Cybersecurity Act (CMCA), which will continue to govern the investigation of cybercrime.
It will:
Require CII owners and operators to take responsibility for securing their systems
and networks. This includes complying with policies and standards, conducting
audits and risk assessments, and reporting cybersecurity incidents. CII owners and
operators will also be required to participate in cybersecurity exercises to ensure
their readiness in managing cyber incidents; and

“We will develop a standalone
Cybersecurity Act that
provides for stronger and
more proactive powers.”
Minister-in-charge of Cybersecurity,
Dr Yaacob Ibrahim, 2015

Facilitate the sharing of cybersecurity information with and by CSA. Recognising that
cybersecurity breaches will happen despite our best efforts, the Act will empower
CSA and sector regulators to work closely with affected parties to expeditiously
resolve cybersecurity incidents and recover from disruptions.
 
CSA has been and will continue to work closely with sector regulators, CII stakeholders
and industry players in formulating detailed proposals for the new Act. A key principle is
to adopt a risk-based approach to cybersecurity, and to build in sufficient flexibility to take
into account the unique circumstances and regulations in each sector.

The need for stronger cybersecurity laws
In 2013, the Government amended
the then-Computer Misuse Act to
strengthen Singapore’s capability
in responding to national-level
cyber threats. This became the
Computer Misuse and Cybersecurity
Act (CMCA). When there is an actual
or suspected cyber threat, the CMCA
empowers the Minister of Home
Affairs to direct affected parties to
share vital information, and carry
out necessary measures to mitigate
the impact of the threat. Additionally,
some sector regulators have other
legislative powers to enforce
cybersecurity requirements on their
licensees. These powers, however,
vary from sector to sector, depending
on the operating environment and
level of technology adoption in
each sector.

CHAPTER 1

Today, cybersecurity threats
have become more sophisticated.
Essential services around the
world, including Singapore’s, face
a greater risk of being disrupted.
In the recent past, cyber perpetrators
have demonstrated attacks on a
range of essential services, including
the power grid and key banking
systems. There is a need to implement
more robust laws that allow for a
more proactive approach to national
cybersecurity. Many countries have
also strengthened their cybersecurity
laws over the past few years,
focusing on areas such as standards
for essential service providers,
information sharing, and cyber
crisis management.

CHAPTER 1

SECURE
GOVERNMENT NETWORKS
Government systems are among the prime targets
for cyber-attackers. Government systems contain
sensitive data, including those about their citizens;
they may be linked to essential services supplied
by CII operators; they are used to support a gamut
of public services including the maintenance of
national security and sustaining the economy.
Hence, the Government will spare no effort in
safeguarding its systems and networks. The
Government has undertaken, in this current term,
to work towards a goal of setting aside 8 per cent
of its ICT expenditure on cybersecurity.
The Government sector is already identified
as one of the eleven CII sectors in the national
cyber response plan.

The Government’s plans as a CII sector
lead incorporate many of the elements of
the larger national plan. They involve:
Reducing the attack surface presented by
Government systems and erecting multiple
layers of security controls and network
segmentation according to vulnerability
and need;
Expanding our capacity to detect, correlate
and analyse threats, using automation
and other technologies; and
Sharpening the skills of our incident
responders and stress-testing our
systems through more complex and
realistic attack scenarios.
Cybersecurity professionals on duty at Cyber-Watch Centre (CWC)

Reducing
Attack Surface
The Government has put in place long-term
measures including on-going and proactive
reviews of the ICT operating environments,
to ensure that security controls are commensurate
with rapidly evolving threats. For example,
in view of the increased frequency of targeted
attacks on Government networks, the Civil
Service will separate Internet surfing from the
networks that hold classified data according
to vulnerability, exposure and need.
 
At the same time, the Government will continue
its approach of adopting new technologies
to deliver secure and resilient digital services.
It is also looking into risk reduction initiatives
to minimise the potential loss of citizens’ data
or prolonged outages of digital services.

20

CHAPTER 1

Enhancing Situational
Awareness through Technology
The Monitoring and Operations Control Centre
(MOCC), Cyber-Watch Centre (CWC), and Threat
Analysis Centre (TAC) provide the Government
with cyber situational awareness of its networks.
 
We will continue to invest in technologies such
as analytics, automation, artificial intelligence,
and other state-of-the-art security technologies.
This will maintain the centres’ operational
excellence, to enable timely detection and
response to a cyber incident.

Preparing for
Cyber Breaches
The Government has expanded
considerable effort in building a
team of highly-skilled security incident
responders. However, we recognise
that no system is 100 per cent foolproof and breaches may still occur even
despite the best of our efforts. We will
continue to hold regular cybersecurity
exercises to stress test our procedures
and capabilities for a realistic evaluation
of our proficiency, and conduct redteaming sessions to validate the security
of our systems. The Government
will work with the sectors to ensure
that CII protection plans are in place
for expedient remediation to restore
essential services.

Cyber-Watch Centre (CWC)
The Cyber-Watch Centre (CWC)
was established by the Infocommunications Development
Authority of Singapore (IDA) in
2007 to monitor cyber threats to
government networks and provide
early warning of impending cyberattacks. To improve the detection
of malicious activities which could
affect access to online public services,
the CWC was upgraded in 2015 with
a wider range of detection capabilities
and enhanced correlation capabilities.
This is an example of a proactive
defence-in-depth security measure
to mitigate increasingly sophisticated
attacks and enhance infocomm
infrastructure security.

A

SAFER
CYBERSPACE

Digital connectivity has both empowered and endangered
businesses and individuals. It opens new social and commercial
opportunities, yet also exposes citizens to criminal syndicates across
the world. By commandeering computing devices, these malicious
actors can steal data, extort money, and attack networks, causing
harm to others. Cyberspace needs to be kept safe and trustworthy
for businesses and individuals to benefit from it.
Keeping cyberspace safe requires a spectrum of actions from the
international to individual levels. Countries have to cooperate to
take down criminals operating across borders, while businesses
and individuals can take preventive measures to keep their systems
and devices safe. Cybersecurity is the collective responsibility of
everyone - the Government, businesses, individuals and the community.

The Government will:
Combat cybercrime through the National Cybercrime Action Plan
(NCAP). The National Cybercrime Action Plan (NCAP) was launched
in July 2016 to establish a coordinated national effort to deal with
cybercrime. First, we will educate and empower the public to stay
safe in cyberspace, as it is more effective to prevent a cybercrime
from happening in the first place. Second, we will enhance the
Government’s capacity and capability to combat cybercrime,
in view of cybercrime’s transnational nature, speed and scale. Next,
we will strengthen legislation and the criminal justice framework.
This will support the investigation of cybercrimes and prosecution
of cybercriminals. Finally, we will step up partnerships and
international engagement to manage the rapidly evolving nature
of cybercrime and tackle cross-border issues.
 
Enhance Singapore’s standing as a trusted hub.
We will build a trusted data ecosystem by fostering trust between
organisations and users for data usage. Next, we will develop Data
Protection Officers as a professional career track to support the
effective implementation of data protection measures. We will also
strengthen Singapore’s position as a data hub by facilitating crossborder data flows and introducing Data Protection TrustMarks. Finally,
we will work with partners – global institutions, other governments,
industry partners and Internet Service Providers – to achieve a
cleaner internet by regularly measuring the health of the Internet,
identifying cyber threats quickly and reducing malicious traffic.
 
Promote collective responsibility for cybersecurity.
The actions of each business and individual can impact our
collective safety in cyberspace. Businesses and individuals need to
stay informed and take preventive measures to secure their computer
systems and digital devices, particularly to prevent malicious actors
from hijacking their systems and devices to cause harm to others.
Communities and business associations can take the lead to make
cybersecurity a priority, and tap on government cybersecurity
expertise to improve their members’ understanding of cybersecurity
issues and encourage adoption of good practices. With the right
knowledge, expertise and attitude, we can all reap the full benefits
and possibilities of technology.

CYBERCRIME:
THE NEW CRIMINAL FRONTIER

The growth of the Internet has created numerous business and social opportunities. However,
where there are opportunities, there are also risks. Locally and internationally, the Internet has been
exploited for cybercrimes like scams, hacks and thefts.
For businesses, malicious cyber activities may cause service disruptions and loss of data pertaining
to customers, employees, and commercial entities. These can result in substantial revenue losses,
erosion of customer goodwill, and loss of reputation. Inextricably, personal lives may also be affected.
For individuals, poor personal cybersecurity habits can open doors to cybercrime and malicious
activities. Extortion, fraud, and adverse credit ratings are some of the detrimental consequences that
individuals and their families may face, when their computers and mobile devices are compromised
and personal data stolen.

Ransomware
In May 2016, ransomware
encrypted University of
Calgary’s computer systems
on the eve of a conference.
The conference organisers
had to re-create processes
and conference data by hand
for the event to continue.
To prevent the malware from
spreading to the rest of the
systems, the University had
to shut down other IT services,
causing a week-long, campuswide disruption that was more
far-reaching than the impact
of the malware.
The malicious actors behind
this incident demanded the
equivalent of Canadian $20,000
in Bitcoins to decrypt the data.
The University eventually
gave in and paid the ransom
to retrieve the research data.

Supply chain malware attack
In 2013, more than 40 million credit
card numbers were stolen through
malware that was injected into the
US retailer Target’s Point-of-Sales
system. Although Target had
multiple cybersecurity solutions in
place, the malware slipped in through
one of Target’s vendors. Further
investigations were hindered as
the stolen data was sent offshore.
Target incurred US$252 million
of breach-related expenses and
faced several lawsuits. Target’s CEO
held himself personally accountable
and resigned.

24

CHAPTER 2

Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)

Smartphone hack

In January 2016, online banking
services for millions of HSBC UK
customers were taken offline by a
DDoS attack. The disruption happened
on an important day for personal
finances; it was the first pay-day of the
year, and two days before the deadline
for personal tax returns. Many HSBC
customers took to social media to vent
their anger.

In 2015, 50 Singapore users
had their smartphones infected
by a malware that disguised
itself as a banking application
to steal credit card details and
other user credentials.
Today’s smartphones are
essentially computers that
execute highly personal tasks
while being always connected
to the Internet, making them
attractive targets for cybercrime.

DDoS attacks work by overwhelming
websites with Internet traffic. Globally,
such attacks have become more
frequent against even small businesses.
The motives are varied. Attacks can be
used to protest against a company, take
down a competitor temporarily, or be
part of extortion threats.

Online scams

Malware enabled heist
In February 2016, US$81 million was
stolen from Bangladeshi Bank in a carefully
coordinated hack. After using stolen credentials
to initiate fraudulent bank transfers, the
hackers used malware to hide the traces of
the transactions, hindering remediation actions.

Traditional crime is increasingly
migrating to where Singaporeans
spend a good part of their
time – online. The number of
e-commerce and online scam
cases in Singapore doubled from
1,929 in 2014 to 3,759 in 2015,
resulting in a loss of S$16.7
million.

CHAPTER 2

25

COMBAT CYBERCRIME
National Cybercrime Action Plan (NCAP)
The Internet has afforded criminal elements the
opportunity to commit cybercrimes quickly, easily
and on a large scale. Criminals have also exploited
the anonymity provided by the Internet and the
transnational nature of cybercrime to escape
detection and prosecution. These characteristics
of cybercrime pose significant challenges for law
enforcement agencies around the world.
As the use of the Internet becomes more prevalent
in Singapore, the number of cybercrime cases has
risen sharply. Recognising the need for a concerted

and coordinated national effort to effectively
deal with the cybercrime, the Ministry of Home
Affairs (MHA) launched the National Cybercrime
Action Plan (NCAP) in July 2016.
The NCAP sets out the Government’s key
principles and priorities in combating cybercrime.
The Plan also details the Government’s ongoing
efforts and future plans to tackle cybercrime.
The vision of the NCAP is to ensure a safe and
secure online environment for Singapore.

The NCAP has four priority areas:
Educating and
empowering the
public to stay safe
in cyberspace

A

Prevention is the best way
to combat cybercrime; the
majority of cybercrimes can
be prevented if businesses
and individuals are educated
on the risks of cybercrime
and adopt simple cybercrime
prevention measures to
protect themselves online.

26

CHAPTER 2

(i) Conducting outreach to the
general public

(ii) Engagement of vulnerable
groups in society

In order to educate and empower
the public to stay safe in cyberspace,
the Singapore Police Force (SPF)
regularly shares cybercrime
prevention messages with the
public via various media platforms,
such as television, newspapers,
social media, text messages and
posters at public transport nodes
and lifts in public housing blocks.
At the local community level, SPF’s
Neighbourhood Police Centres
frequently engage the residents
through Community Safety &
Security Programmes and roadshows.
Through its Public Cyber-Outreach &
Resilience Programme (PCORP), SPF
uses behavioural insights to nudge
the general public to adopt good
cyber hygiene practices.

SPF has also tailored its
cybercrime prevention outreach
programmes to match the profile
of different vulnerable groups
in society, thereby ensuring
that the message of cybercrime
prevention is effectively
communicated to all segments of
society. Through its Collaborative
Social Programme (CoSP), SPF
will work with schools and NonGovernmental Organisations
(NGOs) to raise cybercrime
prevention awareness among
vulnerable groups.
(iii) Providing a one-stop selfhelp portal against scams
SPF has worked with the National
Crime Prevention Council (NCPC)
to transform the Scam Alert
website (www.scamalert.sg) into
a one-stop self-help portal against
scams. The portal will provide
information to the public on the
different types of scams, and
empower the public to take steps
to guard against them.

B

Enhancing the
Government’s capacity
and capability to
combat cybercrime
The transnational nature
of cybercrimes, coupled
with the speed and scale
at which such crimes are
perpetrated, presents
formidable challenges
for traditional law
enforcement approaches.
In order to effectively
combat cybercrime,
the Government will
(i) establish the SPF
Cybercrime Command,
(ii) boost cybercrime
investigation capabilities,
(iii) equip public officers
with the relevant skills
to combat cybercrime, and
(iv) enhance coordination
between SPF and
government agencies.

(i) Establishing the SPF
Cybercrime Command
The SPF Cybercrime Command
was established in December 2015
to increase the agility and
effectiveness of the SPF to respond
to cybercrimes by integrating SPF’s
cyber-related investigation, forensics,
intelligence and crime prevention
capabilities within a single command.
(ii)	Boosting cybercrime
investigation capabilities
SPF has also embarked on several
technology initiatives to improve
its cybercrime investigation
capabilities. These efforts will enable
SPF to effectively investigate the
rising number of cybercrime cases
and quickly process large volumes
of digital information in order to
sieve out necessary evidence for
a successful prosecution.
One such initiative is the DIGital
Evidence Search Tool (DIGEST) that
will automate the forensic processing
of voluminous data. This will in turn
lighten the workload of investigation
officers and allow them to focus
their efforts on more specialised
investigation functions. The tool
will also reduce the processing time
for digital evidence, ensuring that
investigation officers can follow up
on leads expeditiously and solve
cases in a shorter time.
(iii) Equipping public officers
handling sensitive data with the
relevant skills to combat cybercrime

cybercrime. To achieve this, a Cyber
Security Lab (CSL) has been set up
in the CCSS as a modern hands-on
facility for familiarising trainees on
approaches to mitigate cyber threats
and investigate cyber incidents.
CCSS will expand its curriculum
to offer a variety of skills-based
courses, ranging from cybersecurity
fundamentals and cyber defence,
to incident response, digital forensics
and malware analysis. These courses
are tailored to the needs of officers,
depending on their professional roles
and competency requirements.
(iv) Strengthening coordination
between SPF and government
agencies
SPF also works closely with
its partner agencies to ensure
a coordinated response to
cybercrimes. In recent years,
AGC and SPF have worked closely
together on sensitive and highprofile cybercrime cases, coming
together right from the start of the
investigations. AGC’s expertise has
helped SPF to ensure that crucial
evidence is secured at an early
stage and that police investigations
are watertight.
Given the closely-related nature
of cybersecurity and cybercrime,
SPF and CSA will work together
to ensure an effective response
to cyber-related incidents and
conduct exercises to stress-test
existing workflows, coordination
arrangements and procedures.

In recognition of growing
cybersecurity and cybercrime threats,
the Centre for Cyber Security Studies
(CCSS) was established in 2014
within the Home Team Academy
(HTA). The CCSS facilitates the
capability and capacity development
of Home Team Departments and
key stakeholders responsible for
the protection and operations of
infocomm systems across the public
sector. One of CCSS’ core functions
is to equip Home Team officers with
the necessary skills to deal with

CHAPTER 2

Strengthening
legislation and
the criminal justice
framework

C

The investigation of
cybercrimes and prosecution
of cybercriminals must be
supported by a robust criminal
justice framework. Laws need
to be updated to deal with new
cyber-offences and traditional
crimes committed online.
Regulatory frameworks have to
be constantly strengthened to
prevent criminals from taking
advantage of loopholes.

Stepping up
partnerships and
international
engagement

D

Industry and
Academic Partnerships
Deep expertise to deal with
cybercrimes need not just
reside with the Government
and can be found within the
private sector and academia.
Given the rapidly evolving
nature of cybercrime, the
Government will work closely
with industry players and
Institute of Higher Learning
(IHLs) so that the necessary
information and expertise
to deal with the latest threat
posed by cybercrime can
be shared seamlessly.

28

CHAPTER 2

(i) Amending the Computer Misuse
and Cybersecurity Act

(iii) Strengthening regulatory
frameworks

MHA intends to amend the Computer
Misuse and Cybersecurity Act
(CMCA), to ensure that the Act
continues to be effective in dealing
with the transnational nature of
cybercrimes, as well as the evolving
tactics of cybercriminals.

Aside from public education
and outreach, a key method
of cybercrime prevention is
to increase the difficulty of
committing such offences by
plugging potential loopholes
in digital platforms and
processes. MHA will regularly
review regulatory frameworks,
to ensure that cybercriminals are
not able to exploit vulnerabilities
in technology.

(ii) Reviewing other laws
In addition to amending the CMCA,
MHA will review other related laws
such as the Criminal Procedure
Code to ensure that these laws
remain relevant in dealing with
traditional crimes that are committed
in cyberspace.

(i) Increasing cybercrime awareness
in the private sector

(ii) Developing capabilities
to combat cybercrime

MHA has partnered industry
and IHLs to increase awareness
of cybercrimes in the private sector.
SPF regularly engages key private
sector stakeholders, such as those
from the Infocomm Technology
and banking industries to enhance
cybercrime prevention efforts, raise
awareness of cybercrimes and
encourage the adoption of good
cyber hygiene practices.

The Government has also
collaborated with the private
sector to jointly develop
capabilities to respond to the
latest cyber threats. For instance,
SPF has partnered local research
institutes to develop new
cybercrime investigations and
forensics capabilities. MHA has
also worked with IHLs to create
conducive environments for the
development of cyber-related
innovations. One example is
MHA and Temasek Polytechnic’s
joint establishment of the
Temasek Advanced LEarning,
Nurturing and Testing (TALENT)
Lab, which serves as a platform
for IHL students to design and
validate innovations, to see if
they are effective in dealing
with cyber-threats.

Prevention is key in countering
the threat of cybercrime
The scale and complexity of
cybercrime will continue to grow,
with its transnational nature posing
legal and operational difficulties for
law enforcement agencies. Prevention
is therefore still the key strategy to
counter the threat of cybercrime.
The NCAP will prioritise educating

International engagement
Strong international
partnerships enable
countries to deal with
cybercrime more effectively.
Singapore will actively
foster regional and global
cooperation, partner
INTERPOL and other
countries in capacity
building initiatives, and
bring global experts and
thought leaders together
to discuss the latest threats,
trends and solutions in the
cyber domain, and share
best practices and solutions.

and empowering the public to be
safe in cyberspace. Through the
various initiatives in the NCAP,
the Government will build strong
partnerships with industry, IHLs
and the public, and forge a sense
of shared responsibility in the fight
against cybercrime.

(i) Fostering regional
and global cooperation
Singapore is at the forefront of
working with foreign countries to
enhance our operational cooperation
against cybercrime. At the regional
level, Singapore is the Association
of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN)
Voluntary Lead Shepherd on
Cybercrime. This provides a platform
for the ASEAN Member States (AMS)
to coordinate the regional approach
to cybercrime, and work together
on capacity building, training and
the sharing of information. At the
international level, Singapore hosts
the INTERPOL Global Complex for
Innovation (IGCI), INTERPOL’s global
hub on cybercrime. Singapore has
led the IGCI Working Group and
INTERPOL Operational Expert Group
on Cybercrime, working with other
INTERPOL member countries to define
INTERPOL’s cybercrime programme.
Singapore will leverage INTERPOL’s
resources to strengthen our global
operational networks and build new
capabilities to tackle cybercrime.

(ii) Building capacities and capabilities
through collaboration at the regional
and global levels
Singapore has rolled out several
programmes with partner countries and
INTERPOL. This includes the two-year
(2016 – 2018) ASEAN Cyber Capacity
Development Project funded by Japan
and implemented by INTERPOL, the
Singapore-United States Third Country
Training Programme, and the ASEAN Plus
Three Cybercrime Workshop, involving
the People’s Republic of China, Japan and
the Republic of Korea. The involvement of
key Asian partners, AMS and INTERPOL
facilitates a conducive environment for
collaboration on cybercrime issues and
sharing of best practices, and forging
of effective operational links between
countries and across the regions.
(iii) Bringing global experts
and thought leaders together
Since 2013, Singapore has been
supporting thought leadership platforms
that bring together public sector and
industry partners on cybercrime. One
such example is the RSA Conference
Asia Pacific and Japan (RSAC APJ). Held
annually in Singapore, the RSAC APJ
is Asia Pacific’s leading conference on
information security.

CHAPTER 2

29

ENHANCE SINGAPORE'S
STANDING AS A TRUSTED HUB

Build a trustworthy data ecosystem
The compromise of personal data can cause
adverse disruptions to the affected individuals
and businesses. With increasing amounts of data
migrating to computer systems and electronic
devices, there is a need to secure these systems
and safeguard individuals’ data against theft and
misuse. At the same time, organisations can
leverage good personal data management to gain
a better understanding of their customers, increase
business efficiency and effectiveness, and boost
customer confidence.
Trust is essential for a data-enabled economy
and society. To build a trusted data ecosystem,
our organisations have to shift from compliance
to accountability.

Singapore will:
Work with organisations to embrace data
protection as part of their corporate culture;
Professionalise Data Protection Officers to
support the effective implementation of data
protection measures; and
Enhance Singapore’s standing as a trusted
data hub by introducing Data Protection
Trustmarks and working with foreign Data
Protection Authorities to facilitate crossborder data flows.

Build a relationship of trust
A reliable and robust data ecosystem
promotes trust and innovation. To
help organisations take ownership
in promoting trust and adopting
a mindset of accountability, the
Personal Data Protection Commission
(PDPC) will develop a Data Protection
Management Programme to help
organisations embrace data protection
as part of their corporate culture.
Robust data protection processes
are needed to enable organisations
to better use data. To do so,
organisations should adopt a DataProtection–by-Design approach,
which factors data protection as
a key consideration in the early
stages of any product or service
development. The rigour of this
framework will also require that
businesses conduct Data Protection
Impact Assessment as part of the
design, rollout and review of systems,

30

CHAPTER 2

Ongoing efforts for personal
data protection

Personal Data Protection Seminar 2016

applications and business processes.
Given that data breaches can and will
still happen despite organisations’
best efforts at securing personal data,
PDPC is studying a mandatory breach
notification for serious data breaches.

Under the Personal Data Protection
Act (PDPA), organisations are to take
reasonable steps to manage and secure
personal information that they hold.
Today, the PDPC adopts a multi-pronged
approach in supporting organisations,
particularly the Small and Medium-sized
Enterprises (SMEs). Through industry
briefings, online training resources, and
advisory guidelines, SMEs are equipped
with information on the requirements of
the PDPA and good data management
practices to adopt.

Professionalise Data
Protection Officers

Enhance Singapore’s standing
as a trusted data hub

Today, Data Protection Officers
(DPOs) hail from a range of
occupations. PDPC will develop
a Data Protection Competency
Framework (DPCF) to grow DPOs
as a professional career dedicated
to overseeing data protection
requirements of organisations.
This will ensure that DPOs are
equipped with the relevant skills,
competencies, and certifications
needed to do their jobs.

PDPC is currently developing
a system of Data Protection
Trustmarks to certify organisations’
data protection processes. By helping
organisations gain mutual confidence
in each other’s transactions involving
personal information, the Trustmarks
will increase compliance and
reinforce Singapore’s standing
as a trusted data hub.
Another focus area is the facilitation
of cross-border data flows. PDPC will
identify areas of collaborations and
cooperation with well-established
foreign Data Protection Authorities.
It will participate in global multilateral
networks to mutually recognise
the adequacy of each economy’s
data protection laws, thus enabling
transfers of data across jurisdictions.

Cleaner Internet
The Internet’s ability in allowing anyone to send
large volumes of any form of information – data,
voice, video - to another user has propelled it to
be the world’s dominant communication platform.
However, this design exposes end-users'
machines to malicious software that can hijack
these devices to blast phishing emails and even
launch cyber-attacks.
The increasing number of infected machines
spewing malicious traffic into the Internet has made
cyberspace less safe for everyone. Just as we would
stop people who eject sewage into clean water
pipes, we will also have to block users who may be
unwittingly polluting the Internet pipeline and alert
them on measures for cleaning up their machines.
As “gatekeepers” managing the Internet gateways
and enabling information flows across the Internet,
local Internet Service Providers (ISPs) play an
essential role to achieve a safer Internet space.
In 2011, the Government issued the first Secure
and Resilient Internet Infrastructure Code of
Practice to designated ISPs to ensure that sound
security is in place to deal with current and
emerging cyber threats. The Info-communications
Media Development Authority (IMDA) will
continue working with the ISPs to secure Internet
infrastructure for businesses and individuals.
Singapore will join the global community to measure
and improve the health state of cyberspace, and
CSA will collaborate with international organisations
on this front. To complement these efforts, the
Singapore Computer Emergency Response Team
(SingCERT) will continue to obtain early warning
of cyber threats and alert users on the preventive
measures they can adopt.

CHAPTER 2

31

PROMOTE COLLECTIVE
RESPONSIBILITY
The prevalence of ICT and the Internet has transformed the way
we work, play, live, learn and connect with one another. Just as
we lock our doors and keep our keys safe in the physical world,
we have a similar responsibility to stay safe in the cyber world.
Individuals now keep more of their friends’ and families’ personal
data than ever before on personal devices. The stakes are higher
for businesses as they are custodians of computerised data that
are vital to operations and impact customers’ lives. Cybersecurity
is a collective responsibility and a way of putting Total Defence
into action to keep Singapore safe. Everyone, whether individuals
or businesses, has a role in creating a safer cyberspace.

Stay informed
Recognising that businesses and
individuals can reduce cyber
incidents by taking basic measures,
the Government has taken steps to
educate the public on cybersecurity
since the first Infocomm Security
Masterplan was launched in 2005.
This needs to be a continuous effort
as “old” technology gets upgraded
with smart features. Today, 8 in 10
Singapore residents install anti-virus
software on their computers but only
3 in 10 do so on their smartphones².
CSA will keep the public updated
on new cybersecurity measures
to keep pace with technological
changes. We will continue existing
outreach programmes such as the
Cybersecurity Awareness Campaign
which started since 2011. We will
also broaden their reach across
age groups, and to include both
individuals and businesses. We will
leverage national security awareness
building platforms such as the Total
Defence and Let’s Stand Together
campaigns to raise appreciation of
the role of cybersecurity for a

strong and prepared nation.
We will expand the range of
resources on the GoSafeOnline
web portal and other critical
social media platforms.
Public education can be more
effective through collaborative
projects across the government,
industry and community. The
Inter-Ministry Cyber Wellness
Steering Committee brings
cyber-wellness messages to
youths and has reached more
than 245,000 participants
through 25 supported projects
since 2009. Another example is
the Cyber Security Awareness
Alliance, which brought together
government agencies, private
enterprises, and professional
associations to promote
the adoption of essential
cybersecurity practices. Since its
formation in 2008, the Alliance
has reached out to various
audiences through exhibitions,
clinics and talks.

Make cybersecurity
a business priority
For sustained and sustainable
cybersecurity adoption, cyber risks
should be recognised and treated
as important business risks. Trade
Associations and Chambers (TACs)
play an important role in reaching
out to businesses.
Trade Associations and Chambers
(TACs) play an important role in
improving the cybersecurity of their

members’ business operations.
The Government will continue
engaging TACs to help their members
tap on grants and resources to adopt
cybersecurity measures and develop
cybersecurity capabilities. We will
also work with TACs to advocate the
Security-by-Design approach and
incorporate cybersecurity holistically
into business risk management.

Tap on government
cybersecurity expertise
Businesses may find it challenging
to keep pace with new cyber threats.
SingCERT, which was set up in 1997
to facilitate the detection, resolution
and prevention of cybersecurity
related incidents, will deepen its
threat discovery and analysis
capabilities to deal with the evolving
local cyber threat environment.
SingCERT will expand its capacity to
facilitate the sharing of cybersecurity

information with the business
community, while ensuring that
sensitive corporate and personal
data are protected. It will also
partner the industry and Institutes
of Higher Learning (IHLs) to support
cybersecurity resource centres for
businesses and individuals.

VIBRANT
CYBERSECURITY
ECOSYSTEM

The Government will work with industry partners, professional
associations, IHLs and research institutes in three main areas.
We will:
Establish a professional workforce. We will encourage existing
cybersecurity professionals to develop their careers in the industry
by defining clearer career pathways, promoting internationallyrecognised certifications, and building strong communities of
practice. To grow the workforce, we will attract promising students
through scholarship and sponsorship programmes. We will also
support new entrants to the profession through industry-oriented
curriculum for students as well as up-skilling and re-skilling
opportunities for mid-career professionals.
Extend Singapore’s cybersecurity advantage through strong
local companies. We will build up the industry by attracting and
anchoring companies with advanced capabilities. We will also
nurture start-ups to boost the development of niche and advanced
solutions and grow local champions to sustain strategic areas of
interest. We will also develop market opportunities to bring
made-in-Singapore solutions into the global market.

With its advanced infrastructure and tech-savvy workforce,
Singapore is well-positioned to develop a vibrant cybersecurity
ecosystem comprising highly skilled professionals, companies with
deep cybersecurity capabilities and strong translational research
and development (R&D).
The ecosystem will ensure a sustainable source of expertise and
solutions to support our plans for a resilient national infrastructure
and a safer cyberspace. It will also bring economic opportunities
to Singaporeans and Singapore-based companies. Singapore’s
cybersecurity industry is dynamic and fast-growing, and has the
potential to double in value by 2020. Furthermore, integrating
cybersecurity service offerings with industry sectors that Singapore
is traditionally strong in will enhance our competitive advantages
in these areas.  

Innovate to accelerate the industry’s growth. The National
Cybersecurity R&D Programme has set aside S$190 million from
2013 to 2020 to support research into both technological and
human-science aspects of cybersecurity. We will sustain this effort
with world-class R&D facilities and focused talent development
programmes. We will promote R&D collaborations between the
Government, academia and industry to engender faster and more
market-relevant R&D outcomes.

ESTABLISH A
PROFESSIONAL
CYBERSECURITY
WORKFORCE

New entrants to the cybersecurity
workforce will be supported by:
Industry-oriented Curriculum

Good security requires highly-skilled
practitioners with deep expertise. Today, there is
a shortage of cybersecurity manpower around the
world. Qualified professionals are in great demand
as businesses pay more attention to cyber risks.
This demand will only increase as the frequency
and consequences of cyber threats continue to
grow. To ensure that Singapore has an adequate
and well-trained cybersecurity workforce,
Singapore will:
Encourage existing professionals to remain
and further their development in the industry.
We will institute clear career pathways,
promote certification, and foster strong
communities of practice; and
Work with industry and IHLs to attract new
graduates and convert existing professionals
from related fields. IHLs will update their
curriculum to be relevant to industry needs so
as to facilitate the transition of new entrants to

the workforce. We will offer cybersecurity
scholarships and sponsorships to attract
promising students. We will also offer
up-skilling and re-skilling opportunities
to cross-train mid-career professionals in
cybersecurity for better job prospects.
The cybersecurity profession is fast-paced and
varied. There are opportunities to specialise
in different areas. These include incident
response, digital forensics and penetration
testing for the technically inclined; threat
and intelligence analysis for the analyst-atheart; and risk management and governance
for the methodical change drivers. Regardless
of specialisation, cybersecurity professionals
from entry-level to C-suite positions are
highly sought after as companies across
many industries seek to secure their systems
and data. The Government is committed to
developing the cybersecurity industry as
a source of good jobs for Singaporeans.

Our universities and polytechnics
already offer cybersecurity
programmes for those keen to
pursue a cybersecurity education.
For example, the Singapore
Institute of Technology (SIT)
offers a Bachelor of Engineering
with Honours in Information and
Communications Technology
(Information Security), and
Singapore University of
Technology and Design (SUTD)
offers a Masters in Cybersecurity.
The Government will work with
Institutes of Higher Learning
(IHLs) and industry partners to
ensure that these programmes
and curriculums continue to be
relevant to the industry, with
students learning and acquiring
practical skills.
In particular, the Ministry of
Education (MOE) is launching a
co-operative degree programme
where students alternate between
campus and company on a
semester basis. The programme

Scholarship and Sponsorship
Programmes
To strengthen the branding of
cybersecurity, the Government
will build on existing scholarship
and sponsorship programmes.
Overseas cybersecurity
scholarships will be offered to
promising students, and students
with outstanding performance in
IHLs will be given opportunities
to further their education.
6th Singapore Cyber Conquest, Winner

enables students to develop a deeper
and practical understanding of their
field of study by integrating work
and study. Students may even
be hired by the company from
the outset. CSA will be one of
the participating agencies in this
programme and will be working with
the partner universities to develop
the cybersecurity degree curriculum
and provide on-the-job training to
successful applicants.

Up-skill and Re-skill
Opportunities
We will facilitate the conversion
of professionals in related fields
to cybersecurity by building on
the existing Cyber Security
Associates and Technologies (CSAT)
programme. In line with SkillsFuture,
these professionals will be able to
up-skill and re-skill themselves and
be cross-trained in cybersecurity
for better job prospects.

Current professionals can look forward to:
Defined Career Trajectory
The growth of a capable, adept and
competent workforce is sustained
by attractive career prospects and
a respected professional status.
The Government will work with
the industry to define a competency
framework for cybersecurity
professionals and it will be
incorporated into the upcoming
SkillsFuture Framework⁴ to be
launched in 2017. This will allow
professionals and employers to

determine the types of skills and
competencies required for different
cybersecurity jobs, and to establish
relevant training programmes and
clearer career pathways accordingly.

bring cybersecurity discussions
into the boardroom. Larger
companies could also define
apex cybersecurity positions
at the C-suite level.

Companies are also encouraged to
work with the Government to help
cybersecurity professionals develop
complementary skills such as risk
management and communication.
These will facilitate professionals in
translating cybersecurity issues into
enterprise risk considerations, and

To further improve the standing
of cybersecurity professionals,
the Cyber Security Agency of
Singapore (CSA) will work with
industry partners to reach out
to more companies, especially
Small and Medium-sized
Enterprises (SMEs), to increase

their awareness of what
cybersecurity professionals
do, and how they can contribute.
The Government will take
the lead in introducing a
cybersecurity scheme of
service for the public sector,
with competitive remuneration
and progression prospects.
It will also train and develop
cybersecurity specialists across
the public sector.

Internationally-recognised
Certifications
Cybersecurity professionals should
deepen their skills and keep abreast
of evolving technologies and best
practices. One way to do so is to
adopt internationally-recognised
certifications in areas such as digital
forensics, malware analysis and
incident response. CREST Singapore
(Council of Registered Ethical
Security Testers), for example, offers
certification for practising penetration
testers in Singapore.

Strong Communities of Practice

To build a common identity and
foster trust within the profession,
the Government will work with
industry associations such as the
Association of Information Security
Professionals (AISP) to introduce
and build strong Communities
of Practice for cybersecurity
professionals in Singapore.

⁴ The Skills Framework is part of SkillsFuture, a national movement initiated by the Singapore Government
in 2015 to help Singaporeans in skills development and skills mastery for the future.

CHAPTER 3

Support Start-ups
Singapore’s cybersecurity ecosystem will
benefit from more start-ups that diversify
the industry and boost the development
of niche and advanced solutions. The
Government and industry will work
together to support a strong network
of venture capitalists, accelerators and
entrepreneurs to help Singapore-based
cybersecurity start-ups to grow and scale.
This will assist in bringing ideas to the
market easily and quickly.

Grow Local Cybersecurity Champions
The Government will grow local
cybersecurity champions who can
develop globally competitive capabilities
in strategic areas of interest and sustain
the long-term growth of a competent,
professional workforce. The “Partnership
for the Advancement of the Cybersecurity
Ecosystem” (PACE) programme, initiated by
CSA in 2016, is an example of a meaningful
public-private partnership that co-develops
customised solutions with industry partners
for raising our cybersecurity posture while
supporting workforce skills development.

Develop Market Opportunities
We will facilitate access to new market
segments for our cybersecurity companies
and promote Made-In-Singapore solutions.
Government and industry will collaborate
to set up a cybersecurity resource centre
for users to explore and adopt innovative
solutions. Together, we aim to bring
Singapore’s cybersecurity capabilities
to the global market.

CHAPTER 3

INNOVATE TO ACCELERATE
For Singapore to be at the cutting-edge of cybersecurity, strong
R&D capabilities, institutions and partnerships are necessary.
These contribute to the building of resilient infrastructure and the
generating of new economic activities.
New cybersecurity solutions must be tested in the real world as part
of their development process. Singapore is an ideal test-bed, as a
small and agile city state with strong rule of law. Pilot solutions can
be quickly implemented and scaled in Singapore. Companies and
research labs can leverage Singapore’s global position in sectors
such as finance and logistics to develop solutions with international
significance. As these developed sectors will seek to innovate,
they could also serve as ready markets to test new cybersecurity
products and solutions.
Singapore will:
Support research into both technological and human-science
aspects of cybersecurity through the S$190 million National
Cybersecurity R&D (NCR) Programme;
Establish world-class facilities in specialised research areas and
develop local talent to sustain the community; and
Collaborate more closely with academia and industry under
the NCR Programme to develop innovative ideas and enhance
translational capabilities. A stronger public-private partnership
will ensure that R&D can address real-world problems in a more
targeted manner, and move research products more quickly from
the lab to the market.

National Cybersecurity
R&D Programme
Singapore’s cybersecurity R&D journey has already
started, with the aim of translating R&D capability
in Singapore into operational strengths. The S$130
million NCR was launched in 2013 by the National
Research Foundation (NRF). This was further topped
up in 2016 by an additional S$60 million as part
of the Research, Innovation and Enterprise 2020
Plan (RIE 2020). The NCR Programme has already
awarded 13 projects covering research areas such
as cyber-physical systems security and forensics.

CHAPTER 3

World-Class R&D Facilities and
Focused Talent Development
Singapore will continue to establish world-class
R&D facilities in specialised research areas
to attract top researchers and international
collaborators, and will promote the shared use
of such facilities. The Government is funding
S$8 million towards the National Cybersecurity
R&D Laboratory at the National University of
Singapore (NUS) that will be a shared resource
for cybersecurity researchers from academia,
industry and the Government. We will also
set up programmes to groom local talent for
a sustainable and vibrant R&D community.

New R&D Facilities

Our universities play a central role in
R&D. Each university will become a
cybersecurity centre of excellence, and
we see each already developing its own
area of specialisation. For example, the
Singapore University of Technology
and Design (SUTD) has a strong focus
on cyber-physical systems, and the
Singapore Management University
(SMU) specialises in mobile security.

In 2016, we also saw the launch of several
public-private initiatives, such as the ST
Electronics-SUTD Cyber Security Laboratory
developed under the Corporate Laboratory
@ University scheme administered by the
National Research Foundation (NRF). This
laboratory brings together industry and
academia under one roof to perform cuttingedge cybersecurity research.

The Secure Water Treatment (SWaT) at SUTD is funded by the Ministry of Defence and NRF.
It will serve as a key asset for researchers in Singapore and abroad who are studying the design
of secure cyber-physical systems.

R&D Collaborations between Government,
Academia and Industry
Public and private sector agencies can embark
on new R&D projects to examine and address
complex problems impeding the cybersecurity
industry’s growth. One example is the Cyber
Risk Management (CyRiM) project on cyber
risk insurance, which was launched in 2016 by
the Nanyang Technological University (NTU)
with sponsorship support from the Monetary
Authority of Singapore (MAS) and a consortium
of insurance industry players. The project
brings together academic expertise, industry

knowledge, and policy know-how to address the
data and standards gaps required for an efficient
cyber risk insurance market place.
The Government will initiate a Cybersecurity
Consortium, with S$1.5 million in funding over
three years from 2016. This Consortium will bring
together Government, industry and academia to
collaborate on research and seek out viable and
practical solutions with commercialisation potential.

STRONG

INTERNATIONAL
PARTNERSHIPS

Cyber threats do not respect sovereign boundaries and cyber-attacks
can emanate from almost anywhere in the world.
 
Malicious actors have deliberately exploited jurisdictional gaps
between countries to their advantage.
 
Moreover, with countries increasingly connected to one other through
trade, global logistics and financial markets, cyber-attacks disrupting
one country can and do have serious spill-over effects on other
countries. International collaboration in cybersecurity is thus pivotal
to our collective security.
 
Singapore has been an active participant at international  platforms
on cybersecurity. As an ASEAN member, we have supported and
contributed to regional efforts to build cybersecurity capabilities.

Through consensus, agreement, and cooperation, cyberspace can
be a safer and more secure place for all.
To achieve this, Singapore will:
 
Forge international and ASEAN cooperation to counter cyber
threats and cybercrime. We will continue working closely with the
international community and ASEAN partners to strengthen platforms
and procedures for cyber incident reporting and response. We will
work with ASEAN Member States to coordinate the regional approach
to cybercrime. We will also leverage INTERPOL’s resources to tap the
global operational networks and capabilities to tackle cybercrime.
 
Champion international and ASEAN cyber capacity building
initiatives in operational, technical, legislative, cyber policy and
diplomatic areas. We will partner the international community,
Dialogue Partners and ASEAN Member States to organise workshops,
seminars and conference that seek to advance cooperation and build
capabilities in these aspects .
 
Facilitate exchanges on cyber norms and legislation.
We will continue to participate in global and regional discussions
on cyber norms, cyber policy and legislation, cyber deterrence,
and cybercrime cooperation. We will host an annual Singapore
International Cyber Week (SICW) – with the inaugural session in
October 2016 – to catalyse, stimulate and promote exchanges on
cybersecurity and cybercrime issues.

FORGE INTERNATIONAL
AND ASEAN COOPERATION
TO COUNTER CYBER THREATS
AND CYBERCRIME
The lightning-fast speed of
cyber-attacks requires quick
and coordinated actions both at
national and international levels.
Singapore will work closely with
the international community and
ASEAN partners to strengthen
the platforms and procedures for
reporting cyber incidents, sharing
information and responding to
possible breaches.

Singapore, provides global
training and coordinates
international operations on
cybercrime for all INTERPOL
member countries. Singapore is
well-positioned and committed
to cooperating with the IGCI
and other countries through
INTERPOL to conduct crossborder joint operations against
cyber criminals⁵.

Singapore will also partner
international organisations
like INTERPOL to tackle
cybercrime and the Asia Pacific
Computer Emergency Response
Team (APCERT) to enhance
cyber incident reporting and
response linkages.

Singapore will continue to
contribute at existing ASEAN
channels for cooperation such as
the annual ASEAN CERT Incident
Drill (ACID), ASEAN Network
Security Action Council (ANSAC),
ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF)
Mechanisms as well as ASEAN
cybersecurity and cybercrime
workshops.

For example, the INTERPOL
Global Complex for Innovation
(IGCI), which is based in

Channels for cooperation
The ASEAN Regional Forum (ARF) was established in 1994 to foster constructive
dialogue and consultation on political and security issues of common interest and
concern, and to make significant contributions towards confidence building and
preventive diplomacy in the Asia-Pacific region.
The multi-stakeholder ASEAN Network Security Action Council (ANSAC)
was set up in 2012 to promote CERT cooperation and sharing of expertise.
The ASEAN CERT Incident Drill (ACID) is an annual exercise aimed at
strengthening cooperation among CERTs in ASEAN and its Dialogue Partners.
The exercise tests the coordination amongst the incident response teams and
their incident handling procedures. Singapore has convened ACID since 2006.
