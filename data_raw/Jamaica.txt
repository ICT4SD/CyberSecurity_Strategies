EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This Strategy recognizes that Information and Communications Technology
is a necessary tool for national development but with it comes inherent
risks which must be mitigated against. Cybercrimes have the potential
to erode confidence and trust in the economy thereby impairing national
development.
This Strategy seeks to establish a framework built around the following
key areas: i) Technical Measures; ii) Human Resource and Capacity Building;
iii) Legal and Regulatory; and (iv) Public Education and Awareness.

Technical Measures will seek to ensure that network infrastructure
and in particular critical infrastructure systems are resilient to cyber
threats. These efforts will include the establishment of a Cyber Incident
Response Team (CIRT). A risk based approach will be adopted whereby
risk assessments will be undertaken and the necessary preventative
measures (including the application of best practices and standards) will
be promoted and adopted by both the private and public sector.
Human Resource and Capacity Building recognises that establishing and
sustaining a pool of trained professionals in Information Security will
assist in ensuring there is national capacity to detect, respond and recover
from cyber incidents as well as promote local research and development
in Information Security in Jamaica.

Legal and Regulatory efforts will be focused on examining and undertaking
reform in the legislative landscape to promote a healthy and safe business
environment where businesses can thrive and all stakeholders can be
assured that should they fall victim to cybercrimes there is recourse.
Public Education and Awareness seeks to develop targeted campaigns
to facilitate each stakeholder group’s understanding the potential threats
and risks they would likely face and appropriate action they can take to
protect themselves. The vulnerable in the society are specifically identified
as requiring special attention.
This Strategy therefore represents a high-level approach to cyber security
that establishes a range of national objectives and priorities that will be
achieved within a specified timeframe1. The Strategy seeks to:

¡¡a and awareness regarding cyber security; and
¡¡develop a culture of cybersecurity.
Ultimately the Strategy, will seek to engender confidence in cyber space
such that Jamaicans can continue to achieve their full potential.

INTRODUCTION

INTRODUCTION
Since the liberalization of the Telecommunications sector in 1999,
phenomenal strides have been made in the area of Information and
Communications Technology (ICT). Jamaica now boasts tele-density in
excess of 108%; a 100% digital telecommunications network; submarine fibre optic transmission ring around the island; international submarine cable links from Jamaica to Cayman, the Dominican Republic,
Cuba and Florida; and a competitive ICT sector.
An additional outcome of liberalization has been the growth of the Business
Process Outsourcing (BPO) sector. Jamaica has become a highly competitive
and attractive business destination and a leading contact centre location
in the English-speaking Caribbean. As at March 2014, the local ICT/BPO
industry is estimated to be valued at US$230 million, accounting for six per
cent of the Caribbean and Latin American market. Additionally, there are
36 ICT/BPO operations employing over 14,000 individuals in the industry
and is poised to double in size by 20162.
While Jamaica’s tele-density indicates universal access to voice telephony,
internet penetration and more specifically fixed broadband penetration
remains low at 4.4% in 2013. Through the Universal Service Fund (USF)
the Government has and is utilizing various strategies to encourage
access including the:

Additionally, it is expected that more consumers will have access to
broadband with the grant of a licence for the use of the 700 MHz spectrum
for mobile broadband deployment.

The result of the foregoing is that Jamaicans are and will continue to be
more connected to each other and to the world. However, with increased
connectivity and the growing phenomenon of the Internet of Things (IoT)
come increased threats to the daily operations of individuals and businesses
alike. In light of estimates indicating that the Internet has approximately 50
billion “things” connected to it, with the number of connections predicted
to increase to 13 Quadrillion by the year 20203; Jamaica must be prepared
to address these threats if it is to continue to utilize ICTs for economic
and social development.

The Government’s vision with respect to ICT is to create a knowledgebased and educated society which is globally competitive and productive;
giving rise to the strategic placement of Jamaica as the key ICT hub
within the region’.4
Additionally, the National Development Plan (Vision 2030)5 has as one of
its national outcomes a technology enabled society where ICT, as a sector
and an enabler of other sectors, is utilized to, among other things, drive
productivity and efficiency and unleash the creative potential of Jamaicans.
At the centre of Jamaica’s focus on increased use and application of ICT
is broadband. Several authoritative and global research studies have
clearly established the link between ICT use and GDP growth6. More
recently, with broadband being considered critical to economic and social
development, more and more studies have focused on elaborating this
link. Research undertaken by the World Bank has shown that the
development impact of broadband on emerging economies is greater
than for high-income countries and that broadband has a potentially
higher growth effect than other ICTs, including wireline telephony and
mobile telephony7.Additionally, research also suggests that broadband
access and broadband speed positively affect household incomes8 and
that children with Internet access at home perform better in school and
are better-protected against online dangers as they are usually under
parental guidance9.Jamaica is positioning itself to benefit from the increased
use of ICTs and broadband and therefore notwithstanding potential security
threats and the myriad of possible cyber-attacks, it cannot become
complacent if it is to reap the derivative economic benefit inherent in
utilizing ICTs. Tangible and workable solutions must be found to create
a safe environment which engenders confidence in the use of ICTs by
both citizens and businesses while enabling creativity and innovation.

THE THREAT OF CYBERCRIME				
AND ITS IMPACT ON NATIONAL SECURITY
The National Security Policy10, states that ‘a fight against crime is therefore
a fight for development; measures to reduce the social and economic
damage caused by pervasive crime have to be integral to the developmental
activities of the state.’ It is also a globally recognized fact that cybercrime
is a real and present threat to the stability of any society and Jamaica
is no exception. The scale and sophistication of cybercrime has caused
many Governments to rethink their strategy in protecting their citizens
in an increasingly technology driven and dependent global economy.
Cybercriminals usually have clear objectives when launching their exploits.
They know what information they are seeking or what outcomes they want
to achieve, and they know the path they need to take to reach these goals.
These criminals will spend significant time researching their targets, often
through publicly available information on social networks, and plan their
objectives strategically. Many of these malicious attacks have sought to
expose and/or exploit sensitive and confidential information which can have
detrimental effects for government and critical infrastructure operators.
There is a thinking that users of the Internet should assume that nothing
in the cyber world can or should be trusted. Yet organizations in the public
and private sectors as well as individuals still desire the assurance that
the technologies they rely on every day can be trusted11.
In recent years increasing amounts of personal and sensitive data, such
as names, addresses and credit card information, are being harvested by
businesses. Additionally, increasing amounts of businesses store personal
and sensitive data on online platforms or other electronic media. As
massive amounts of data become readily accessible; they have become
high commodity items to cyber criminals as they can be sold to other
malicious actors. Consequently individuals, businesses and government
alike must take adequate precautions to protect their data.

Cybercrime
is a real and
present threat
to the stability
of any society
and Jamaica
is no exception.

Global trends in cybercrimes demonstrate that the financial sector is the
sector most targeted by cyber criminals. Their activities include phishing,
identity theft and the creation of fake banking apps12. The United Nations
Office of Drugs and Crime (UNODC) estimate that identity theft is the most
profitable form of cybercrime, generating perhaps US$1 billion per year in
revenue on a global basis. The same UNODC report estimated that the cost
of identity theft using cyber techniques in the United States was US$780
million13. Additionally, Interpol has stated that more criminals are exploiting
the speed, convenience and anonymity that modern technologies offer
in order to commit a diverse range of criminal activities. These include
attacks against computer data and systems, identity theft, the distribution
of child sexual abuse images, internet auction fraud, the penetration of

INTRODUCTION

online financial services, as well as the deployment of viruses, botnets,
and various email scams such as phishing14.
It is becoming increasingly evident that organized international gangs
are behind most Internet scams and that cybercrimes’ estimated cost is
more than that of cocaine, heroin and marijuana trafficking put together15.
Criminal gangs have recognized that their exposure is less when they
perpetrate cybercrimes with high profits as opposed to other traditional
forms of organized crimes. Jamaica’s National Security Policy therefore
identifies cybercrimes as Tier 1- Clear and present danger, with a high
impact and high probability of occurrence.16.
Another area often targeted by cybercriminals is critical infrastructure.
The critical infrastructure national landscape is the bed rock of daily
operations. The disruption of same has the potential to reduce the flow of
essential goods and services, impede or impair important economic and
financial operations, and fundamentally shut down the country. Therefore,
limiting the vulnerability of critical infrastructure by applying relevant
security standards, while at the same time assessing the risks, will reduce
the options available to criminals to attack these systems.

CYBER INCIDENTS IN JAMAICA
In Jamaica the emerging trend indicates an increase in cyber incidents.
Figure I below shows cybercrimes for the years 2011 and 2012, while	
Figure II shows cybercrimes for the period January – August 2014. Figure
III reflects cyber activities reported to the police for the years 2011 and
2012 but are not offences under the Cybercrimes Act.
In examining our cyber security approach, national security issues cannot
be ignored. Therefore the necessary support needed for the police,
intelligence and other national security services to, among other things,
ensure the maintenance of law and order, to deter, mitigate and protect
against significant external or internal threats, is critical. It will involve
ensuring that vital infrastructure is bolstered and resilience is built into
our social and economic systems so that they can withstand threats17.

FACING THE CHALLENGE
The Government is aware that facing the challenge will be difficult.
The inherent nature of cybercrime makes it a new paradigm for law
enforcement agencies. It is recognized that there are existing deficiencies
in our capacity, processes and technology to properly investigate and
prosecute these crimes. Additionally, it is recognized that the trans-border
nature of cybercrime requires international cooperation to assist in the
prosecution, mitigation and recovery efforts. In this vein, it is recognized
that the academic community and private sector are critical stakeholders
in securing our cyberspace and must play a significant role in advancing
these efforts.

TRAFFICKING PUT TOGETHER.

EXISTING CYBER SECURITY RELATED EFFORTS
A lack of understanding of the mandates of the various players within this
sphere can lead to stove-piped approaches resulting in conflicting legal
requirements and friction between various organizations and their cyber
security functions and capabilities18. This Strategy therefore recognizes
that delineating and correlating the roles and activities of the various
players is of utmost importance.
Our current reality regarding cyber security activities include:

¡¡Revision of the Cybercrimes Act, 2010
Jamaica’s Cybercrimes Act (‘the Act’) was promulgated on March 17,
2010 to address computer specific offences such as unauthorized
interception, unauthorized modification of computer program or data
and unauthorized access to any program or data held in a computer. The
Act requires that its provisions be reviewed by a Joint Select Committee
(JSC) of the Houses of Parliament after the expiration of two years from
the date of its commencement19. An eleven member JSC was established
in January 2013 to consider and report on the operation of the Act. The
recommendations made by the Committee for amendments to the Act
have been adopted by the Houses of Parliament and include increasing the
penalties for the offences under the Act, as well as, the criminalization of
actions prejudicing investigations and activities such as computer related
fraud, forgery and malicious communication. Additionally, provision will be
made for the forfeiture of computer material which is the subject matter
of an offence in the event that the person is convicted of the said offence.

13

National Cyber Security Strategy
Government of Jamaica

¡¡Establishment of a Cyber Incident Response Team (CIRT)
The ICT Policy, in addressing the matter of the utilization of ICT for enhanced
national security, identified as a strategy, the establishment of a CIRT
to address matters regarding cyber threats and appropriate responses
thereto. With the assistance of the International Telecommunication Union
work has commenced on the establishment of a national CIRT and the
building and deployment of related technical capabilities. The CIRT will
be domiciled in the Ministry with responsibility for ICT.

¡¡Establishment of the National Cybersecurity Task Force
The Government has established a National Cyber Security Task Force
(NCSTF) comprising a wide cross-section of stakeholders from the public
and private sector, as well as, academia. The NCSTF will, among other
things,
¡¡ formulate a strategy to develop, grow and retain high quality cyber talent
for the national workforce;
¡¡ assist in creating a framework to facilitate the building and enhancement
of confidence in the use of cyberspace and the protection and security of
related assets through collaboration amongst all stakeholders; and
¡¡ establish a public education and awareness programme.

¡¡Strengthening the capacity of law enforcement officers and prosecutors
The Communication Forensics and Cybercrime Unit (CFCU) within the
Jamaica Constabulary Force (JCF) was established in December 2010
with the merger of three (3) Units, namely the Cybercrimes Unit, Digital
Forensics Unit and Communication Intelligence Unit. The CFCU which has a
staff complement of 22 provides support for the investigation of all crimes.

¡¡The Digital Evidence and Cybercrimes Unit in the Office of the Director
of Public Prosecution (ODPP) was established in 2009 with a view to:
i.	 conducting in-depth research, preparation and prosecution of cybercrimes
and cases involving digital evidence; and
ii.	providing advice to the police and clerk of courts with regards to the
preparation and prosecution of cybercrimes, as well as cases, involving
digital evidence.
Since its establishment the Unit has grown to twelve (12) members.

LINKS WITH OTHER POLICIES AND PROGRAMMES
The Cyber Security Strategy will complement the following Government
of Jamaica (GOJ) policies and programmes:

¡¡The National Information and Communications Technology Strategy
2007-2012;

¡¡The National Development Plan 2030 (Vision 2030 Jamaica);
¡¡The Information and Communications Technology Policy 2011; and
¡¡The National Security Policy 2014.

GUIDING PRINCIPLES

GUIDING
PRINCIPLES
This Strategy is built on the following guiding principles:

¡¡Leadership: Recognizing that the Government is responsible for policy
development with respect to the ICT Sector and is one of the largest
consumers of information technology services, it commits, to driving the
objectives of this Strategy by adopting best practices in its operations;

¡¡Shared responsibilities: All users, in enjoying the benefits of ICTs, should
take reasonable steps to secure their own Information Technology (IT)
systems, exercise care in the communication and storage of personal
and sensitive data and respect the data and IT systems of other users.
This Strategy through its development and implementation supports a
multi-stakeholder approach with shared responsibility for a secure cyber
framework;

¡¡Protection of Fundamental Rights and Freedom: This Strategy will not
impair citizens’ rights under Chapter 3 of the Constitution;

¡¡Risk management: In a globalized world where all internet-connected
systems are potentially vulnerable and where cyber-attacks are difficult
to detect, absolute cyber security is elusive. A risk-based approach to
assessing, prioritizing, mitigating and resourcing cyber security activities
will be applied;

¡¡Innovation and Business Development: Recognizing the importance
of innovation and business development to our national economy, a
cyber-environment that is safe and conducive to such development will
be fostered; and

¡¡Sustainable Resources: A sustainable framework to ensure the
availability of human capital to meet the growing and changing needs in
the area of information and cyber security will be fostered.

Figure 2: National Cyber Security Strategy objectives

TECHNICAL MEASURES

It is important to establish an effective technical platform which includes
both physical infrastructure and human capacity. The key objectives
identified for this area are:

CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SYSTEMS ARE RESILIENT
IN THE FACE OF CURRENT AND FUTURE CYBER THREATS
The protection of the nation’s critical infrastructure is a priority and
will of necessity require collaboration of all relevant stakeholders. The
critical infrastructure community includes public and private entities
which provide information and services which underpin the social and
economic well-being of a nation. Today almost all infrastructures are
becoming increasingly dependent on IT or industrial control systems
(ICS) and, in many cases, both IT and ICS that guarantee their smooth
and reliable operations. This Strategy will ensure that action is taken to
adequately secure these systems from attacks and if penetrated there
are measures in place for minimal downtime.

20

National Cyber Security Strategy
Government of Jamaica

NATIONAL CAPABILITY FOR ENSURING TIMELY 		
AND EFFECTIVE RESPONSE TO CYBER INCIDENTS 		
IS ESTABLISHED AND MAINTAINED
The timely reporting of cyber security incidents plays an important role in
enhancing national cyber security. Incident reporting and analysis helps
authorities to determine what should be the focus of its security measures
to inform national preparedness, response and recovery efforts.
A national CIRT, with a direct reporting line to the Ministry with portfolio
responsibility for ICT, will be established. The CIRT’s services will include
incident response, handling and coordination, vulnerability response and
coordination, alerts and warnings, threat analysis, security audits and
assessments, forensics and risk analysis and education and training. In its
initial stages the CIRT constituents will include all government agencies
and critical national infrastructure operators. Additionally, the CIRT will
seek to issue timely alerts on emerging threats to ensure the integrity of
systems that may be at risk, as well as, build collaborative relationships
with all sectors to, among other things, foster trust.
The Strategy recognizes that cyber incidents may be as a result of criminal
activities (cybercrimes) and as such interagency cooperation between
the national CIRT and law enforcement will be encouraged to ensure
information sharing is facilitated. A framework will be established to
exchange information with its constituents regarding cyber breaches and
possible counter and/or mitigation measures to be deployed.
The CIRT, given its crucial role, will adopt policies for continuous training of its
staff and upgrading of its software and hardware, in order to remain current.

A RISK BASED APPROACH IS APPLIED IN ESTABLISHING
IT AND INFORMATION SECURITY STANDARDS, POLICIES
AND GUIDELINES FOR ICT INFRASTRUCTURE AND CYBER
SECURITY GOVERNANCE
Risk management is the process of identifying, assessing, and responding
to risk and then determining an acceptable level of risk for the assets. This
approach is applicable to both private and public sector assets. All relevant
public and private organizations must take the necessary measures to
protect their ICT infrastructure from threats, risks and vulnerabilities. As
such the establishment of sector specific and general baseline security
requirements will be established outlining the minimum security standards
that all organizations in that sector should comply with.
The Strategy will seek to ensure that mechanisms are developed to assess
existing international best practices in the area of Information Security
and adapt accordingly to suit local conditions. The adoption of minimum
standards for sector specific industries should result in the reduction of
the number of successful attacks.

21

National Cyber Security Strategy
Government of Jamaica

LEVERAGING REGIONAL
AND INTERNATIONAL PARTNERSHIPS
Many cyber security threats and vulnerabilities are international in nature.
Cooperation with regional and international partners for purposes of
information sharing as well as incident response is therefore critical.

HUMAN RESOURCE AND CAPACITY BUILDING

In support of the vision of creating a knowledge based society, this Strategy
will seek to ensure that there exists an available cadre of knowledgeable
and highly skilled professionals in the area of Information Security. The
key objectives identified for this area are:

AN AVAILABLE POOL OF SKILLED
AND KNOWLEDGEABLE PROFESSIONALS IN THE FIELD
OF INFORMATION SECURITY IS MAINTAINED
While it is laudable that some of Jamaica’s tertiary institutions offer
Computer Science and/or Computing Degrees which encapsulate
Information Security and Network Security programmes, more needs to
be done. The challenge therefore is to increase the number and availability
of professionals with a specialization in the discipline of network/cyber
security. The continuously changing nature of the field requires constant
training and education. The Strategy will seek to ensure that academia
supports the growth and development of this field.
Sustainability in the information security ecosystem is crucial and as such
accreditation and certification of skilled personnel in key positions will be
pursued. A catalogue of roles, and the relevant educational background
needed for key positions in Information Security will be developed.
Additionally, a national register with accredited cyber-security professionals
will be created and maintained.

JAMAICA HAS AN ACTIVE AND DYNAMIC CULTURE
OF RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT
Research and Development among stakeholders in academia, private and
public sectors will be encouraged. The Government will partner with local,
regional and international bodies to promote and incentivize innovation
and creativity in ICT and cyber security solutions. The Strategy will seek
to explore the possibility of the establishment of a fund for cyber security
research and development projects.
This knowledge base will be supplemented by an exchange of information on
experiences and evolving trends which will ensure not only the development
of innovative products but that ICT security professionals will have timely
and relevant information at their fingertips in order to perform optimally.

22

National Cyber Security Strategy
Government of Jamaica

LEGAL AND REGULATORY

In the context of the Government’s thrust to have ICT being an enabler for
all sectors, there is need to improve the legislative framework to create
an environment conducive to the efficient operation of the public and
private sectors and provide adequate protection for all.

JAMAICA IS A SAFE PLACE TO DO BUSINESS
Recognizing that all businesses are affected by cyber related issues; it
is the aim of this Strategy to ensure both online and oﬄine transactions
are taken into account. The legislative landscape will be periodically
reviewed to ensure it is adept to treat with subject areas, such as data
protection and electronic transaction and authentication and therefore
support a robust business environment, while remaining compatible with
international best practices.

ESTABLISHMENT OF A ROBUST GOVERNANCE FRAMEWORK
TO SUPPORT THE CYBER SECURITY LANDSCAPE
Jamaica, in this increasingly connected, global landscape must be able to
effectively address threats that arise. Recognizing that all stakeholders
play a role in this, a governance framework that supports a lead entity
with responsibility for cyber security coordination must be established.
Experience has shown that where there are cross cutting themes between
multiple agencies with similar responsibilities confusion emerges. It is
imperative that the roles and responsibilities of both the private and public
sector in the area of cyber security are clearly outlined. The development
of a communication mechanism that delineates roles and responsibilities
of key actors is crucial to the success of this Strategy.

MAINTENANCE OF AN EFFECTIVE LEGAL FRAMEWORK
AND ENFORCEMENT CAPABILITIES TO INVESTIGATE
AND PROSECUTE CYBERCRIMES
It is an act in futility to implement all the measures necessary for
cyber security and cybercrimes legislation if the capacities of those
who are required to enforce and prosecute those laws are not taken
into consideration. The JCF currently has some degree of capacity in
the area of cybercrimes investigation including computer and mobile
forensics. Additionally, the ODPP’s Digital Evidence & Cybercrimes Unit
has training in the prosecution of cybercrimes. However, there is need
for greater sensitization of and/or training for other arms such as the
Jamaica Defence Force, prosecutors in the Resident Magistrate Courts,
as well as, the judiciary. Therefore, there will be targeted sensitization
and training in cyber security and cybercrimes for these stakeholders.
The legislative framework should support regional and international
collaboration for example, investigations across borders and successful
prosecution of trans-border crimes. Additionally, consideration will be
given to being party to international conventions and mechanisms that
support Jamaica’s vision and is in line with the Constitution.

LEGAL PROTECTION IN CYBERSPACE
There will be dedicated efforts to ensure that the legislative framework
for cybercrime adequately addresses emerging threats and trends while
preserving the right to privacy and other fundamental rights and freedoms.
There will be no discrimination in the application of the law; as once a
person falls victim to a cybercrime within the jurisdiction there will be
legal recourse.

PUBLIC EDUCATION AND AWARENESS

Increasing awareness about cyber-security threats and vulnerabilities and
their impact on society has become vital. While there has been increased
adoption of ICT solutions in everyday life, there has not been the same level
of appreciation of the associated risks involved. Through public education and
awareness programmes individuals and corporate users can be informed
of appropriate online behaviour and thus better protect themselves.

JAMAICANS ARE KNOWLEDGEABLE AND AWARE
OF THE CYBER RISKS, AS WELL AS, THE ACTIONS
TO BE TAKEN REGARDING CYBER SECURITY
It is a priority that all Jamaicans should feel confident while using various
online platforms. As the Internet becomes more accessible through various
devices such as tablets, mobile phones, game consoles, and with the
advent of the IoT, more personal and financial information will be exposed
online. In this unregulated space of the Internet, mechanisms must be
implemented to educate users on the risks and the steps that can be
taken to mitigate their chances of becoming a victim, as well as, equip
them with the necessary tools to protect themselves.
Therefore, the national level of awareness about cyber security and the risks
inherent in the use of the Internet will be assessed and appropriately tailored
sensitization programmes developed to inform the Jamaican population.

MEASURES ARE IMPLEMENTED TO PROTECT VULNERABLE
GROUPS IN CYBERSPACE
It is the Government’s responsibility to establish measures which protect
the vulnerable in our society, such as, the elderly, youth and persons
with disabilities, as they often lack the wherewithal to do so themselves.
As the guardian of their interests it is the Government’s responsibility
to ensure that they are not overlooked but are informed and aware of
the risks. Programmes that will encourage the adoption of safe online
practices will be developed and the assistance of service providers will
be sought to provide built in tools to protect this group where possible.

JAMAICA HAS A CULTURE OF CYBER SECURITY
While, it is important to empower Jamaicans with the information and
practical tools needed to protect themselves online. It is equally, important
for individuals to take the security of their own personal data seriously and

practice good habits while navigating the Internet, downloading applications
or sharing information for both business and personal reasons.
In a similar vein businesses will have to implement measures to ensure
the protection not only of their data but that of their customers. This
should extend to employee security awareness and training programs
especially with the wide adoption of bring your own device (BYOD) policies.
Employee awareness is critical to the success of any security program.
It has been noted that adversaries often target employees using social
engineering schemes and thus businesses should implement effective
employee training programmes to ensure the integrity of their systems
is not compromised.
The Strategy will seek to improve the level of awareness of information
security, monitor and develop information skillsets though a proactive plan
for communications for all sectors of society. Additionally, businesses will
be encouraged to adopt self-regulation in the various sectors to ensure
the security not only of their data but that of their customers.

IMPLEMENTATION
AND REVIEW
The implementation of the Strategy will be led by the Ministry with
responsibility for ICT. A detailed outline of the activities associated with
the aforementioned strategic objectives is annexed. It is intended that
the Ministry with responsibility for ICT and the NCSTF will develop an
Implementation Plan to carry out the objectives and activities outlined in
this Strategy within three (3) months of its adoption. This will involve the
delineation of specific tasks associated with the objectives and activities
identified and the allocation of responsibilities to specific entities for
execution. It is envisioned that the preparation of the Implementation Plan
will go hand in hand with a review of this Strategy, which will be revised
and updated every three (3) years or as necessary.

CONCLUSION

CONCLUSION
As Jamaica embraces the benefits of ICT for socio-economic development
and seeks to position itself as a regional leader it must adopt and implement
best practices in cyber security in all facets of its economic and social
life. Recognising this inextricable interplay between socio-economic
development goals and national security strategies, this Strategy will play
an implicit and explicit role in securing the networks needed to support
the realisation of the nation’s development goals (Figure 3). Tackling the
issue of cyber security from this holistic approach therefore will ultimately
impact Jamaica’s vision of having a stable and prosperous economy.
