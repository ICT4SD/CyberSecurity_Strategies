About National Cybersecurity Strategy of Afghanistan (NCSA): 

In late 2001, after the establishment of the interim government, Afghanistan stepped into new 
horizons of political and socio-economic rehabilitation and reconstruction. The subsequent 
transitional and the elected Afghan government introduced new legislations which assisted 
private companies to make investments in the country and provide various services including 
telecommunications and ICT services for the people of Afghanistan. 

The Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT) was the first among 
the sectoral government entities in Afghanistan to design new strategies and policies, enabling 
private sector to make huge investment in the telecommunication and IT sectors. 

In 2009, MCIT established the first Cyber Emergency Response Team (CERT) in Afghanistan 
and it was officially named as AFCERT. The mandate of AFCERT was to fight against cyber 
threats and crimes and provide awareness and solutions on cyber security to the government 
and private sector. In its first two years of operation, AFCERT submitted an official report to 
the MCIT senior management regarding an upsurge in the cyber and electronic crimes in the 
country. In order to fight the said crimes, it was vital to conduct a risk assessment of all 
government ICT infrastructures and come up with a solution to mitigate those risks. 
AFCERT’s proposal on preparing a draft of Cyber Security Strategy for the country was 
accepted by the MCIT and ICT Council and to this end the MCIT and ICT Council 
established a committee. 

In 2012 the first awareness workshop on drafting the NCSA was held in ICTI Institute, 
supported and funded by the US Department of Commerce. It was a 4 day workshop and all 
government CIOs, ICT heads, private sector and academia participated and studied and 
analyzed various strategies from different countries. 

The NCSA committee was chaired by Information Systems Security Directorate of MCIT and 
held its regular meetings and assessments for one year. After a series of assessments and 
recommendations, the NCSA committee finalized and submitted the first draft of the strategy 
in July 2014 to the MCIT and ICT Council to review and adapt its action plan.

“ The art of war teaches us to rely not on the likelihood of the enemy’s not coming, but on 
our own readiness to receive him; not on the chance of his not attacking, but rather on the 
fact that we have made our position unassailable.” 

Sun Tzu, the Art of War 

Introduction 

The use of information and communication technologies has been spreading rapidly in 
Afghanistan and ICTs are playing important roles in all aspects of our lives. Alongside the 
public sector, entities that provide services in critical infrastructure sectors like energy, health, 
aviation, communication and financial services have also been heavily using information and 
communication systems. These systems improve the quality and the speed of the services 
delivery -thus helping organizations work more productively, efficiently and contributing to 
the improvement of living standards. 
As our public sector organizations use ICTs to provide services at an increasing rate, it has 
become an important aspect of our national security and competitiveness to ensure the 
security of information and communication technologies. The vulnerabilities inherent in ICTs 
may cause denial of service or abuse of service attacks, resulting in high scale economic 
losses, disturbance of public order and/or threats to national security. 
It is a fact that cyber space offers opportunities of anonymity and deniability for attacks on 
information systems and data. The tools and knowledge required for attacks are often cheap 
and easy to get, and it has been observed that anyone or any systems across the world can 
participate in cyber-attacks, either knowingly or unknowingly. And it is deemed almost 
impossible to determine who finances and organizes these enduring and advanced cyberattacks 
that target the information systems and data of critical infrastructures. These facts and 
conditions reveal the asymmetrical nature of the risks and threats in cyber space, making them 
even more difficult to tackle.
