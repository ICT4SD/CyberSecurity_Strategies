World  Telecommunication  and  Information  Society  Day  is  held  annually  on  May  17.  To  coincide  with  Bolivia's  
celebrations, the Autonomous Municipal Act No. 067 of the Internet in the Municipality  of La Paz came into effect,  
requiring Internet cafes in the La Paz region to filter  Internet content  to protect children.  EducaBolivia  is a portal  
operated by the Ministry of Education and contains information aimed at parents, teachers and students on a wide  
range of topics, including online safety.  ADSIB  has also organized a training seminar on  protecting web sites from  
cyberattacks.  IITCUP  reports  that  many  universities  in  Bolivia  offer  cybersecurity-related  coursework,  including  in  
digital forensics, and that appropriate personnel from IITCUP often utilize these courses for training. However, most  
of  the  coursework  offered  is  general  in  scope  and  theory-based,  and  incorporates  little  in  the  way  of  hands-on
