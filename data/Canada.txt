Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy: For a Stronger and More Prosperous Canada 

Message from the Minister 
Canadians’ personal and professional lives have gone digital: 
we live, work, and play in cyberspace. Canadians use the 
Internet, computers, cell phones and mobile devices every 
day to talk, email, text and twitter with family, friends and 
colleagues. We do business online everyday, from banking 
to shopping to accessing government services – and we do 
it from wherever we happen to be. Digital infrastructure 
makes all this possible, and also keeps essential services 
up and running. 

Canadians – individuals, industry and governments – are 
embracing the many advantages that cyberspace offers, and 
our economy and quality of life are the better for it. But our 
increasing reliance on cyber technologies makes us more 
vulnerable to those who attack our digital infrastructure 
to undermine our national security, economic prosperity, 
and way of life. 

Our systems are an attractive target for foreign military and 
intelligence services, criminals and terrorist networks. These 
groups are breaking into our computer systems, searching 
through our files, and causing our systems to crash. They are 
stealing our industrial and national security secrets, and our 
personal identities. 

We don’t see them, we don’t hear them, and we don’t 
always catch them. At times they are mere nuisances. 
At other times, they present real threats to our families, 
companies and to our country. 

Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy is our plan for meeting 
the cyber threat. It delivers on the Government’s 2010 Speech 
from the Throne commitment to work with provinces, territories 
and the private sector to implement a cyber security 
strategy to protect our digital infrastructure. It leverages the 
partnerships being established under the National Strategy 
and Action Plan for Critical Infrastructure, and supports the 
ongoing efforts by our law enforcement community to work 
with partners and international allies in cracking down on 
those who use the Internet for crime and illegal activities. 

Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy is a cornerstone of our 
Government’s commitment to keep Canada – including 
our cyberspace – safe, secure and prosperous. 


The Honourable Vic Toews, P.C., Q.C., M.P. 
Minister of Public Safety 



Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy: For a Stronger and More Prosperous Canada 

Introduction 
Cyberspace is the electronic world created by interconnected networks of 
information technology and the information on those networks. It is a global 
commons where more than 1.7 billion people are linked together to exchange ideas, 

services and friendship. 

The Canadian economy relies heavily on the Internet: 

Canadian online sales in 2007 were estimated at 

$62.7 billion;1 and 

In 2007, 87% of Canadian businesses used the Internet.1 

Canadian businesses are moving quickly to adopt the most 
modern digital applications, including next generation and 
mobile technologies. 

Canada’s governments have also become increasingly 
dependent on the Internet. The federal Government alone 
now offers more than 130 commonly used services online, 
including tax returns, employment insurance forms and 
student loan applications. 

Our success in cyberspace is one of our greatest national 
assets. Protecting this success means protecting our cyber 
systems against malicious misuse and other destructive 
attacks. This is a daunting challenge. There is no simple way 

Canadians are embracing cyberspace: 

• 74% of Canadian households had 
paid Internet service in 2008;2 
• 59% of personal tax filings were 
electronic in 2008;3 
• 67% of Canadians banked online 
in 2009.4

to detect, identify and recover from attackers who cannot 
be seen or heard, who leave no physical evidence behind 
them, and who hide their tracks through a complex web 
of compromised computers. 

Cyber security affects us all, in part because even attackers 
with only basic skills have the potential to cause real harm. 
Sophisticated attackers can disrupt the electronic controls of our 
power grids, water treatment plants and telecommunications 
networks. They interfere with the production and delivery of 
basic goods and services provided by our governments and 
the private sector. They undermine our privacy by stealing our 
personal information. Dealing with cyber threats in isolation 
is not enough. Through the implementation of this Strategy, 
the Government will continue to work with the provinces, 
territories and the private sector in a concerted effort to 
address the threats facing Canada and Canadians. 

Every year, we detect more attackers than the year 
before. And every year, those seeking to infiltrate, exploit or 
attack our cyber systems are more sophisticated and better 
resourced than the year before. They are investing in their 
capabilities. We must respond by investing more in ours. 

Cyber attacks include the unintentional 
or unauthorized access, use, mani- 
pulation, interruption or destruction 
(via electronic means) of electronic 
information and/or the electronic and 
physical infrastructure used to process, 
communicate and/or store that 
information. The severity of the cyber 
attack determines the appropriate 
level of response and/or mitigation 
measures: i.e., cyber security. 

The Government is continuing its efforts to help secure 
Canada’s cyber systems and protect Canadians online. 
Indeed this Strategy is but one element in a series of 
initiatives designed to protect Canadians. The Government 
has established the Canadian Cyber Incident Response Centre 
to monitor and provide mitigation advice on cyber threats, 
and coordinate the national response to any cyber security 
incident. The Government will soon introduce legislation 
to modernize law enforcement’s investigative powers, and 
ensure that technological innovations are not used to 
evade lawful interceptions of communications supporting 
criminal activity. 

These are important initiatives, but they are no longer sufficient. 
The threat is becoming more serious. We cannot allow 
our cyber security efforts to remain fixed on the threat as we 
understood it in the past. To ensure that our advanced use of 
cyberspace remains a strategic asset, Canada must anticipate 
and confront emerging cyber threats. Canada’s Cyber Security 
Strategy is our plan for making cyberspace more secure for 
all Canadians. 



Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy: For a Stronger and More Prosperous Canada 

Understanding Cyber Threats 
There are various ways to gain access to information in cyberspace. Attackers 
can exploit vulnerabilities in software and hardware. They can exploit security 
vulnerabilities by tricking people into opening infected emails or visiting corrupted 
websites that infect their computers with malicious software. They can take 
advantage of people who fail to follow basic cyber security practices, such as 
changing their passwords frequently, updating their antivirus protection on a 
regular basis, and using only protected wireless networks. 

Once they have access to a computer, attackers can steal or 
distort the information stored on it, corrupt its operations 
and program it to attack other computers and the systems 
to which they are connected. In many cases, victims suffer a 
theft of their identity and/or their personal assets. According 
to a study by McMaster University,5 1.7 million Canadians 
were victims of identity theft in 2008. The annual cost 
of identity theft in Canada has been estimated at nearly 
$1.9 billion. For this reason the Government has amended 
the Criminal Code to better protect Canadians from 
identity theft. 

Canadian companies can lose the race to bring a product 
to market, or experience other harm without ever realizing 
that their losses were caused by a cyber attack. It has been 
estimated that in a recent one year period, 86% of large 

Canadian organizations had suffered a cyber attack. The loss 
of intellectual property as a result of these attacks doubled 
between 2006 and 2008.6 

Though certain attack tools and techniques are more costly 
and sophisticated than others, most cyber attacks share 
four characteristics that, in part, account for their growing 
popularity. Cyber attacks are often: 

Inexpensive – Many attack tools can be purchased 

for a modest price or downloaded for free from 

the Internet; 

Easy – Attackers with only basic skills can cause 

significant damage;

Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy: For a Stronger and More Prosperous Canada 

Effective – Even minor attacks can cause extensive 
damage; and 

Low risk – Attackers can evade detection and 
prosecution by hiding their tracks through a complex 
web of computers and exploiting gaps in domestic 
and international legal regimes. 

While there is some similarity in the targets and methods 
of cyber attackers, the nature of the threat posed by each is 
made distinct by their differing motivations and intentions. 
Three types of threats are discussed below. 

STaTE SponSorEd CybEr ESpIonagE 
and mILITary aCTIvITIES 

The most sophisticated cyber threats come from the intelligence 
and military services of foreign states. In most cases, 
these attackers are well resourced, patient and persistent. 
Their purpose is to gain political, economic, commercial or 
military advantage. 

All technologically advanced governments and private businesses 
are vulnerable to state sponsored cyber espionage. 
Reports from Canada and across the world confirm that these 
attacks have succeeded in stealing industrial and state secrets, 
private data and other valuable information. 

Some foreign states have declared publicly that cyber attacks 
are a central element of their military strategy. Some states 
have been widely accused of using cyber attacks to coincide 
with – and magnify the effects of – traditional military 
operations. These cyber attack programs are typically 
designed to sabotage an adversary’s infrastructure and 
communications. They may also support electronic attacks 
on an adversary’s military equipment and operations. Cyber 
attacks that disrupt emergency response and public health 
systems would put lives in danger. 

Canada and our allies understand that addressing these 
risks requires modernizing our military doctrines. It is for this 
reason that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) has 
adopted several policy documents regarding cyber defence, 
and like the militaries of our closest allies, the Department 
of National Defence and the Canadian Forces are examining 
how Canada can best respond to future cyber attacks. 

TErrorIST USE of ThE InTErnET 

Terrorist networks also are moving to incorporate cyber 
operations into their strategic doctrines. Among many 
activities, they are using the Internet to support their 
recruitment, fundraising and propaganda activities. 

Terrorists are aware of the potential for using the Western 
world’s dependence on cyber systems as a vulnerability to 
be exploited. For example, there are now online resources 
providing advice to terrorists on how to defend their own 
websites while launching cyber attacks on their enemies. 
In addition, a number of terrorist groups, including Al-Qaeda, 
have expressed their intention to launch cyber attacks 
against Western states. Though experts doubt that terrorists 
currently have the ability to cause serious damage via cyber 
attacks, they recognize that this capacity will likely develop 
over time. 

CybErCrImE 

In much the same way as states have expanded their 
operations into cyberspace, so too have organized criminals. 
The more sophisticated among them are turning to skilled 
cyber attackers to pursue many of their traditional activities, 
such as identity theft, money laundering and extortion. 

Criminals now sell information stolen online, such as credit 
and debit card numbers, login passwords for computer 
servers, and malicious software designed to infiltrate and 
damage targeted systems. Even those of us who are diligent 
in protecting our personal information online are at risk of 
having our personal data stolen from the third parties we 
share it with. 


Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy: For a Stronger and More Prosperous Canada 

Some criminal organizations are now developing customized 
attack software. They are using advanced encryption 
technologies to protect their own assets and trade secrets. 
Some in the law enforcement and security communities 
argue that the capabilities of some cyber criminals now 
rival those of developed states. 


ThE ThrEaT IS EvoLvIng 

Much like bacteria developing drug resistance to antibiotics, 
cyber viruses and malicious code are continually evolving 
to evade our defences and antivirus software. The evolution 
of cyber attack tools and techniques has accelerated dangerously 
in the recent past. Statistics compiled by two well 
known Internet security companies, Akamai and Symantec, 
together show that malicious computer programs now 
originate in more than 190 countries.7 More than 60% of 
all the malicious code ever detected was introduced into 
cyberspace in 20088 alone. 

There is no doubt that the frequency and severity of the cyber 
threat is accelerating. Protecting Canadians in cyberspace 
will be a constantly evolving challenge. To effectively address 
this challenge will require a range of actions and responses, 
accompanied by continuing investment and vigilance over 
the long term.

Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy: For a Stronger and More Prosperous Canada 

Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy 
Canadian researchers have been at the forefront of making cyberspace a reality. 
This same ingenuity must continue to be applied to predicting, detecting and 
defeating the cyber threats of tomorrow, and exploiting cyberspace to further 
Canada’s national interests. 

Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy is our plan for meeting 
the cyber threat. The Strategy is built on three pillars: 

1. Securing government systems – Canadians trust 
Government with their personal and corporate information, 
and also trust Government to deliver services to them. They 
also trust that the Government will act to defend Canada’s 
cyber sovereignty and protect and advance our national 
security and economic interests. The Government will put in 
place the necessary structures, tools and personnel to meet 
its obligations for cyber security. 
2. partnering to secure vital cyber systems outside 
the federal government – Canada’s economic 
prosperity and Canadians’ security depend on the smooth 
functioning of systems outside the Government. In 
cooperation with provincial and territorial governments 
and the private sector, the Government will support 
initiatives and take steps to strengthen Canada’s cyber 
resiliency, including that of its critical infrastructure sectors. 
3. helping Canadians to be secure online – 
The Government will assist Canadians in getting the 
information they need to protect themselves and 
their families online, and strengthen the ability of 
law enforcement agencies to combat cybercrime. 
Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy will strengthen our cyber 
systems and critical infrastructure sectors, support economic 
growth and protect Canadians as they connect to each 
other and to the world. We all have a role to play as we take 
full advantage of cyberspace to build a safe, resilient and 
innovative Canada. 

The Government has sought input from stakeholders on 
a wide range of cyber threats and security practices. 
Collaboration, especially internationally, is essential if 
cyberspace is to be secured. Canada will benefit from 
being seen internationally and domestically as a trusted 
partner in making cyberspace safer. 


Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy: For a Stronger and More Prosperous Canada 

The Strategy: 

• Reflects Canadian values such as 
the rule of law, accountability 
and privacy; 
• Allows continual improvements to 
be made to meet emerging threats; 
• Integrates activity across the 
Government of Canada; 
• Emphasizes partnerships with 
Canadians, provinces, territories, 
business and academe; and 
• Builds upon our close working 
relationships with our allies. 
Three of our closest security and intelligence partners, the 
United States, the United Kingdom and Australia, recently 
released their own plans to secure cyberspace. Many of the 
guiding principles and operational priorities set out in those 
reports resemble our own. This complementarity reflects 
our shared experiences in dealing with cyber security, and 
demonstrates our determination to enhance our collective 
security by leveraging each ally’s domestic cyber regimes. 
Like Canada, our allies intend to review and update their 
plans regularly in response to evolution in cyber security 
technologies and practices, and the cyber threat environment. 

Canada will also build on its existing engagement in cyber 
security discussions at key international fora, such as the 
United Nations, NATO and the Group of Eight. We are one 
of the non-European states that have signed the Council of 
Europe’s Convention on Cybercrime, and the Government is 
preparing legislation to permit ratification of this treaty. 

Canada supports international efforts to develop and implement 
a global cyber governance regime that will enhance our 
security. To the extent possible, Canada will support efforts 
to build the cyber security capacity of less developed states 
and foreign partners. This will help forestall adversaries from 
exploiting weak links in global cyber defences. 

Working Cooperatively 

The Strategy will be implemented by the departments 
and agencies most directly responsible for securing the 
Government’s cyber systems. We will work with our provincial 
and territorial partners, as they are jointly responsible 
for protecting much of the critical infrastructure in Canada. 

Canada’s academic community, non-governmental organi- 
zations and private sector must join the Government in 
securing Canada’s cyber systems. Each of these communities 
has unique technological and analytical capabilities to offer, 
and a strong incentive to secure their own systems. Their 
collaboration is essential to our shared success to secure 
Canada and increase our productivity and prosperity. 

Individual Canadians must also play a primary role in 
securing Canada’s cyber future. The Government can introduce 
and support important cyber security initiatives, but it 
cannot protect each of us from every threat we encounter 
when we go online. Canadians must become aware of these 
threats, and of the tools available to recognize and avoid 
them. Most importantly, they must use these tools to 
protect themselves and their families. 

Cyber security matters to everyone, 
everyday. It matters for a safer and 
more prosperous Canada. 

Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy: For a Stronger and More Prosperous Canada 

Specific Initiatives 
Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy is built on three pillars: 

Securing Government systems; 
Partnering to secure vital cyber systems outside the federal Government; and 
Helping Canadians to be secure online. 


SECUrIng govErnmEnT SySTEmS 


The cyber world in which Canadians live, work and play lacks 
the regimes of law and order that govern our physical world. 
The Government is entrusted with safeguarding some of our 
most personal and sensitive information in its electronic 
databases. It provides services to Canadians and the private 
sector through its websites and electronic processing 
systems. And the Government transmits highly classified 
information essential to our military and national security 
operations via its classified communications systems. 

There have been many cyber attacks directed at Government 
systems. Cyber attackers regularly probe these systems, looking 
for vulnerabilities. Securing these links is not simply a matter 
of operational efficiency. It is a matter of national security 
and sovereignty, protecting the lives of our foreign service, 
military and law enforcement personnel, the integrity of 
our economy, and safeguarding the personal information 
of Canadians. 

We must and will strengthen the Government’s capability 
to detect, deter and defend against cyber attacks while 
deploying cyber technology to advance Canada’s economic 
and national security interests. Achieving the cyber integrity 
of Government requires that roles and responsibilities are 
clear, systems are strengthened and Government employees 
are aware of proper procedure. 

Establishing Clear Federal Roles 
and Responsibilities 

With a subject as critical as cyber security, there is no room 
for ambiguity in terms of who does what. This Strategy sets 
out the required clarity. 

Public Safety Canada will coordinate implementation of the 
Strategy. It will design a whole-of-Government approach 
to reporting on the implementation of the Strategy. It will 
provide central coordination for assessing emerging complex 


Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy: For a Stronger and More Prosperous Canada 

threats and developing and promoting comprehensive, coordinated 
approaches to address risks within the Government and 
across Canada. Within Public Safety Canada, the Canadian 
Cyber Incident Response Centre will continue to be the focal 
point for monitoring and providing advice on mitigating cyber 
threats, and directing the national response to any cyber 
security incident. Public Safety Canada will also lead public 
awareness and outreach activities to inform Canadians of 
the potential risks they face and the actions they can take 
to protect themselves and their families in cyberspace. 

The Communications Security Establishment Canada has 
internationally recognized expertise in dealing with cyber 
threats and attacks. With its unique mandate and knowledge, 
the Communications Security Establishment Canada will 
enhance its capacity to detect and discover threats, provide 
foreign intelligence and cyber security services, and respond 
to cyber threats and attacks against Government networks 
and information technology systems. 

The Canadian Security Intelligence Service will analyze 
and investigate domestic and international threats to the 
security of Canada. The Royal Canadian Mounted Police will 
investigate, as per the Royal Canadian Mounted Police Act, 
suspected domestic and international criminal acts against 
Canadian networks and critical information infrastructure. 

The Treasury Board Secretariat will support and strengthen 
cyber incident management capabilities across Government, 
through the development of policies, standards and assessment 
tools. The Treasury Board Secretariat is also responsible 
for information technology security in the Government 
of Canada. 

Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada will advise 
on the international dimension of cyber security and work to 
develop a cyber security foreign policy that will help strengthen 
coherence in the Government’s engagement abroad on 
cyber security. 

The Department of National Defence and the Canadian 
Forces will strengthen their capacity to defend their own 
networks, will work with other Government departments to 
identify threats and possible responses, and will continue 
to exchange information about cyber best practices with 
allied militaries. The Department of National Defence and 
the Canadian Forces will also work with allies to develop 
the policy and legal framework for military aspects of cyber 
security, complementing international outreach efforts of 
Foreign Affairs and International Trade Canada. 

Given the speed and complexity of many cyber attacks, 
barriers to cooperation and information sharing between 
federal partners must be eliminated. The Strategy includes 
measures to address this need, and provides the additional 
financial and personnel resources required to allow the 
Government to fulfill its cyber security obligations. 

Strengthening the Security of Federal 
Cyber Systems 

For each new technology or practice adopted to enhance our 
cyber security, another is developed to circumvent it. We will 
continually invest in the expertise, systems and governing 
frameworks required to keep pace with these evolving 
threats. We will also review our options for increasing the 
risks and consequences applied to those who attack our 
cyber systems. 

The Government will enhance the security of its cyber 
architecture. It will continue to reduce the number of Internet 
gateways into its computer systems, and take other measures 
to secure systems. 

In 2009 the Government made a number of important 
amendments to its Policy on Government Security. 
Administered by the Treasury Board Secretariat, the Policy 
sets out safeguards to assure the delivery of Government 
services to Canadians. Since the Government relies extensively 
on information technology to provide these services, 
the Policy emphasizes the need for departments and agencies 
to monitor and secure their electronic operations. 


Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy: For a Stronger and More Prosperous Canada 

The globalization of the technology industry makes it difficult 
to assess suppliers’ trustworthiness. Cyber attackers are well 
aware of the opportunities created for them by security gaps 
in the global supply chain. Some organized crime syndicates 
and foreign intelligence services have already exploited 
these vulnerabilities in an effort to disseminate exploitable 
technologies. The Government will strengthen processes 
to reduce the risk related to compromised technologies. 

Enhancing Cyber Security Awareness 
throughout Government 

While clear roles and responsibilities, and strengthened 
systems are important to achieving cyber security, the 
Government’s success in securing its systems is largely 
dependent on its employees. As countless incidents in 
all segments of society have shown, even the most 
sophisticated security systems can be undermined by 
simple human error. In Government, as elsewhere, people 
can fail to follow basic cyber security practices by: 

Not changing their passwords on a regular basis; 

Assuming that an office email system is more secure 

than it is; and 

Importing malicious viruses into workplace computers 

by visiting corrupted websites.

The economic success of Canada’s private sector depends in 
large measure on its ability to secure cutting edge research 
and intellectual property, business transactions and financial 
data. Failing to secure these assets inevitably leads to lost 
market share, fewer customers and corporate breakdown. 

In much the same way, our personal wellbeing depends on 
access to secure and reliable services from our transportation 
systems, communication networks and financial institutions. 
It is increasingly important to protect two of the primary contributors 
to our quality of life – private companies that drive 

our economic prosperity and the infrastructure systems that 
support our daily activities – against cyber threats. Failure 
to do so will have adverse economic impacts and undermine 
consumer confidence. 

A 2008 study by McMaster University9 on identity theft in 
Canada found that 20% of consumers have eliminated or 
reduced the amount of shopping they do online, and that 
9% have eliminated or reduced online banking activities 
due to the risks they perceive in doing business online. By 
building a secure and trusted business environment, we will 
help foster the productivity and innovation that drive our 
economic prosperity. 

The public needs to be more aware of the vulnerabilities 
inherent in the cyber systems that these industries use 
to deliver their services. Increased awareness will equip 
Canadians to avoid identity theft and potential financial loss. 
The Government will partner with the provinces, territories 
and private sector to improve the cyber security posture of 
Canada and Canadians. 

The Government will build on existing programs and expertise, 
such as Defence Research and Development Canada’s Public 
Security Technical Program to better support cyber security 
research and development activities. We will also collaborate 
with our private sector and academic partners to enhance 
information sharing activities. 

Partnering with the Provinces and Territories 

Strengthened partnerships among all levels of government 
are an essential component in delivering a comprehensive 
cyber security strategy for Canada and Canadians. Our 
provincial and territorial counterparts provide a range of 
essential services whose delivery is dependent on the safe 
and secure operation of their cyber systems. For example, 
they hold sensitive personal information in their electronic 
databases, including health records, marriage and driver 
licenses, and provincial tax return information. The provinces 

9 McMaster University, Measuring Identity Theft in Canada: 
2008 Consumer Survey 


Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy: For a Stronger and More Prosperous Canada 

and territories have a key role to play in promoting awareness 
among Canadians, especially young Canadians in the education 
system where first exposure to the Internet often occurs. 
Only when all levels of government are working together can 
Canadians be assured that their private information is secure 
and the services that they depend on will be delivered. 

Partnering with the Private Sector and 
Critical Infrastructure Sectors 

Many of the risks and impacts of cyber attacks are shared 
between the Government and private sector. For example, 
untrustworthy technology is harmful to both government and 
industry. Identifying these risks must be done in partnership. 

Fortunately, Canada’s public and private sectors share a long 
history of working together to achieve shared economic and 
national security goals. This cooperation needs to be further 
strengthened. Each partner must share accurate and timely 
cyber security information regarding existing and emerging 
threats, defensive techniques and other best practices. 

Strengthened public/private partnerships will be fostered 
through existing structures and organizations, such as critical 
infrastructure sector networks. Cross sector mechanisms will 
also be established, providing opportunities for governments 
and industry to collaborate on a broad range of critical infrastructure 
issues, including cyber security. 

Another key area for collaboration is the security of process 
control systems. These systems control everything from our 
machines and factories to our critical infrastructures. They keep 
our dams from overflowing, our electrical grids from collapsing 
and our transportation networks from malfunctioning. Their 
security is critical to the safe delivery of the services and 
products upon which Canadians depend. Joint public/private 
sector initiatives will be struck to identify and share best 
practices for addressing threats to these systems. 

Our collective cyber security efforts will be further refined 
through training and exercise programs. The result of these 
exercises, some of which are already underway, will be an 
improved understanding of the dynamic among partners 

in cyber security. Participation in these exercises will also 
support the improvement of procedures to prevent cyber 
security failures. 

The disruption of critical infrastructure and cyber systems 
can have direct impacts on businesses and communities on 
both sides of the Canada–United States border. Attacks on 
interconnected cyber networks can have cascading effects 
across industrial sectors and national borders. For this reason, 
Canada will be active in international fora dealing with critical 
infrastructure protection and cyber security.

Our success in harnessing cyberspace has helped us achieve 
unprecedented personal productivity and prosperity. But it 
has also allowed the world’s criminals to commit traditional 
crimes with 21st century technologies. The Government is 
taking steps to protect cyberspace from becoming a criminal 
haven. We will deny cyber criminals the anonymity they 
are seeking while at the same time protecting the privacy 
of Canadians. 

Combatting Cybercrime 

Criminals are learning quickly that cybercrime can be inexpensive, 
low risk and profitable. In one well known incident 
uncovered in 2007,10 over 45 million customer records were 
stolen from a well known North American retailer. The breach 
occurred over a three year period, during which criminals 
monitored wireless signals from point of sale credit card 
terminals. These attacks cost the retailer over $130 million 
and inflicted unknown financial harm on individual victims. 

Also in 2008, 11 people operating in five different countries 
were charged11 with breaking into the databases of nine major 
North American retailers, stealing some 40 million credit and 
debit card numbers from their databases, and selling the 
numbers (via the Internet) to other criminals.

Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy: For a Stronger and More Prosperous Canada 

Canada’s law enforcement agencies cannot combat transnational 
cybercrimes with outdated investigative powers 
and tools. Equipping our police to protect us in cyberspace 
requires that we provide them with new legislative authorities 
and supporting financial resources. 

Accordingly, the Royal Canadian Mounted Police will be given 
the resources required to establish a centralized Integrated 
Cyber Crime Fusion Centre. This team will increase the ability 
of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police to respond, using a 
risk-based analysis approach, to requests from the Canadian 
Cyber Incident Response Centre regarding cyber attacks 
against Government or Canada’s critical infrastructure. 

The Government has already passed legislation to combat 
identity theft. Other legislative reforms will be re-introduced by 
the Government to enhance the capacity of law enforcement 
to investigate and prosecute cybercrime by: 

Making it a crime to use a computer system to sexually 
exploit a child; 

Requiring Internet service providers to maintain intercept 
capable systems, so that law enforcement agencies can 
execute judicially authorized interceptions; 

Requiring Internet service providers to provide police 
with basic customer identification data, as this information 
is essential to combatting online crimes that occur in real 
time, such as child sexual abuse; and

Protecting Canadians Online 

Canadian families want their privacy, identities and physical 
wellbeing protected from cyber predators. And Canadians 
know that risks exist. According to a Decima Research study:12 

Only 35% of Canadians believe their computer is 
very safe against online threats; and 


12 Decima Research, Cyber Security Practices in Canada, 
Final Report, February 2008 

77% are concerned about the security of personal 

information. Yet 63% use the Internet for sensitive 

transactions and 57% keep sensitive information 

on their computers. 

As long as they know how to do so, Canadians will strengthen 
their own individual cyber security and that of Canada as a 
whole. We all need to follow basic cyber security practices, 
such as changing our passwords frequently, updating antivirus 
protection and using only protected wireless networks. 

The Government will increase Canadians’ awareness of 
common online crimes and will promote safe cyber security 
practices through the use of web sites, creative materials 
and outreach efforts. 

The Government’s ultimate goal is to create a culture of cyber 
safety whereby Canadians are aware of both the threats and 
the measures they can take to ensure the safe use of cyberspace. 
Creating such awareness will require a sustained effort 
over a period of several years. The effort must start now. 


Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy: For a Stronger and More Prosperous Canada 

Moving Forward 
With each passing day, Canadians’ dependence on cyberspace grows. There is 
no turning back to a world without an Internet. Just as previous generations took 
advantage of increasingly complex and helpful methods of communications, 
we have embraced the Internet. 

But as we enjoy the benefits of cyberspace, we also recognize 
that it threatens us in a variety of ways. Those who choose 
to abuse the Internet are becoming more sophisticated and 
dangerous every day. We must invest now in cyber security to 
protect our economic prosperity, national security and quality 
of life. 

Canada’s Cyber Security Strategy is Canada’s plan for securing 
our cyber systems. The Strategy will protect the integrity 
of Government systems and our nation’s critical assets. It 
will combat cybercrime and protect Canadians as they use 
cyberspace in their daily lives. By promoting awareness of the 
need for cyber security, the Strategy will encourage individual 
Canadians, industry and all levels of government to adapt 
behaviour and adopt the technology required to confront 
evolving cyber threats. 

The Government will begin implementing new initiatives 
under the Strategy in 2010. The initiatives outlined in this 
Strategy are important first steps. They will be adjusted 
and strengthened as required. 

Cyber security is a shared responsibility, one in which 
Canadians, their governments, the private sector and our 
international partners all have a role to play. The Strategy 
reflects this shared responsibility. Implementation will be 
a collective effort. Its success will depend on our ability 
to work together. 

Everyone must do their part.
