Approved by President of the Russian Federation Vladimir Putin on September 9, 2000  

  
                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                     29-12-2008  

   The Information Security Doctrine of the Russian Federation represents a totality of official  
   views on the goals, objectives, principles and basic guidelines for ensuring information  
   security in the Russian Federation.   

   The present Doctrine serves as the basis for:   

   - shaping government policy on information security in the Russian Federation;   

   - preparing suggestions to improve the legal, procedural, scientific-technical and  
   organizational framework for ensuring information security in the Russian Federation;   

   - devising targeted national information security programs.   

   The present Doctrine expounds the National Security Concept of the Russian Federation as  
   applied to the information sphere.   

   I. INFORMATION SECURITY OF THE RUSSIAN FEDERATION   

   1. The national interests of the Russian Federation in the information sphere and  
   how they are to be secured   

   The present stage in societal development is characterized by an increasing role of the  
   information sphere, which represents an assemblage of information, information  
   infrastructure, entities engaged in the collection, formation, dissemination and use of  
   information, and a system governing public relations arising out of these conditions. The  
   information sphere as a system-forming factor of societal life actively influences the state of  
   the political, economic, defense, and other components of Russian Federation security. The  
   national security of the Russian Federation substantially depends on the level of  
   information security, and with technical progress this dependence is bound to increase.   

   By the information security of the Russian Federation is meant the state of the protection of  
   its national interests in the information sphere, as determined by the overall balanced  
   interests at the level of the individual, society and the state.   

   The interests of the individual in the information sphere consist of the exercise of the  
   constitutional rights of man and the citizen to information access, to use of information in  
   the interest of carrying on activities not prohibited by law and of physical, spiritual and  
   intellectual development, as well as of the protection of information that ensures personal  
   security.   

   The interests of society in the information sphere consist of securing the interests of the  
   individual in this sphere, reinforcing democracy, creating a rule-of-law social state,  
   achieving and maintaining public harmony and of the spiritual renewal of Russia.   

----------------------- Page 2-----------------------

The state’s interests in the information sphere consist of creating conditions for harmonious  
Russian information infrastructure development and for the exercise of the constitutional  
rights and freedoms of man and the citizen with respect to receiving and using information  
to ensure the inviolability of the constitutional system, the sovereignty and territorial integrity  
of Russia, and political, economic and social stability; the interests of the state also consist  
in the unconditional maintenance of law and order and in the promotion of equal and  
mutually advantageous international cooperation.   

Based on the national interests of the Russian Federation in the information sphere, the  
state forms its strategic and current domestic and foreign policy objectives for ensuring  
information security.   

Four ingredients of the national interests of the Russian Federation stand out as most  
salient in the information sphere.   

The first ingredient of Russia’s national interests in the information sphere comprises  
observance of the constitutional rights and freedoms of man and the citizen to receive and  
use information, the assurance of a spiritual renewal of Russia, and the preservation and  
reinforcement of the moral values of society, traditions of patriotism and humanism and the  
cultural and scientific potential of the country.   

Achieving this requires:   

- raising information infrastructure use efficiency for the sake of social development, the  
consolidation of Russian society, and the spiritual rebirth of the multinational people of the  
Russian Federation;   

- streamlining the system of formation, preservation and rational utilization of information  
resources that form the basis of the scientific, technical and spiritual potential of the  
Russian Federation;   

- securing the constitutional rights and freedoms of man and the citizen freely to seek,  
receive, transmit, produce and disseminate information by any legal means and to get  
reliable information about the state of the environment;   

- securing the constitutional rights and freedoms of man and the citizen to personal and  
family privacy, the secrecy of postal mail, telegraph, telephone and other communications,  
as well as to the defense of honor and reputation;   

- reinforcing the mechanisms of legal governance of relations in the field of intellectual  
property protection, and creating conditions for observance of the federally prescribed  
restrictions on access to confidential information;   

- guaranteeing the freedom of mass information and the prohibition of censorship;   

- not allowing for propaganda or campaigning that serves to foment social, racial, national  
or religious hatred and strife;   

- securing a ban on the collection, storage, use and dissemination of information about the  
private life of persons without their consent and of any other information to which access is  
restricted by federal legislation.   

----------------------- Page 3-----------------------

The second ingredient of the national interests of the Russian Federation in the  
information sphere comprises information support for the state policy of the Russian  
Federation that involves conveying to the Russian and international public trustworthy  
information about the state policy of the Russian Federation and about its official position  
on socially significant events in Russian and international life, with the provision of access  
for citizens to open government information resources.   

Achieving this requires:   

- bolstering the state mass media, expanding their capabilities to promptly convey reliable  
information to Russian and foreign citizens;   

- intensifying the formation of open government information resources and raising the  
efficiency in their practical use.   

The third ingredient of the national interests of the Russian Federation in the information  
sphere comprises promoting modern information technologies, boosting the national  
information industry (the industries of informatization, telecommunication, and  
communication facilities in particular), securing the satisfaction of domestic market  
requirements with its products, and their entry into the world market, and providing for  
accumulation, storage reliability, and effective utilization of national information resources.  
Problems in developing high technologies, retooling industry, and multiplying achievements  
in national science and technology can be solved only on this basis under present-day  
conditions. Russia must occupy a worthy position among world microelectronic and  
computer industry leaders.   

Achieving this requires:   

- developing and improving the infrastructure of the unified information space of the  
Russian Federation;   

- developing the Russian information services industry and raising the efficiency in  
utilization of government information resources;   

- developing the production in the Russian Federation of competitive informatization,  
telecommunication and communication systems and means, and expanding participation  
by Russia in the international cooperation of producers of these systems and means;   

- providing government support of Russian fundamental and applied research, and  
developments in the areas of informatization, telecommunication and communication.   

The fourth ingredient of the national interests of the Russian Federation in the information  
sphere comprises protecting information resources against unsanctioned access, and  
securing the information and telecommunication systems whether already deployed or  
being set up on the territory of Russia.   

For these purposes it is necessary to:   

- enhance the security of information systems including communication networks, primarily  
the security of primary communication networks and information systems in the federal  
bodies of state authority, the bodies of state authority of the constituent entities of the  

----------------------- Page 4-----------------------

Russian Federation, credit and financial, and banking spheres, the sphere of economic  
activity as well as the security of systems and means for informatizing weapons and military  
equipment, security of troop and arms control systems, and the security of management  
systems for environmentally hazardous and economically important enterprises;   

- intensify development of the domestic production of information protection hardware and  
software, along with the methods to control their efficiency;   

- secure data that constitute state secrets;   

- expand international cooperation by the Russian Federation with respect to the  
development and secure utilization of information resources and counteraction against the  
threat of rivalry in the information sphere.   

2. Types of threats to the information security of the Russian Federation   

According to their general directionality, threats to the information security of the Russian  
Federation are subdivided into the following types:   

- threats to the constitutional rights and freedoms of man and the citizen in the area of  
spiritual life and information activities, to individual, group and public consciousness and to  
Russia’s spiritual revival;   

- threats to information support to Russian Federation state policy;   

- threats to Russian information industry (including informatization, telecommunication, and

shortage and the lack of a system of forming and implementing a state information policy.   

The threats to the national information industry (the industries of informatization,  
telecommunication, and communication facilities in particular), to the satisfaction of  
domestic market requirements with its products and their entry into the world market, as  
well as to the accumulation, storage reliability, and effective utilization of national  
information resources may be as follows:   

- opposition to access by the Russian Federation to newest information technologies, to the  
mutually advantageous and equal participation of Russian producers in the world division of  
labor in the industry of information services, means of informatization, telecommunication  

----------------------- Page 6-----------------------

and communication and information products, as well as the creation of conditions for  
increasing Russia’s dependence in the field of modern information technologies;   

- purchases of imported means of informatization, telecommunication and communication

and developing the Russian information infrastructure;   

----------------------- Page 7-----------------------

- unsanctioned access to information contained in databanks or databases;   

- breach of the lawful restrictions on information dissemination.   

3. Sources of threats to the information security of the Russian Federation   

The sources of threats to the information security of the Russian Federation are subdivided  
into external and internal.   

To the external sources belong:   

- activities of foreign political, economic, military, intelligence and information entities,  
directed against the interests of the Russian Federation in the information sphere;   

- the striving of a number of countries toward dominance and the infringement of Russia’s  
interests in the world information space and to oust it from external and domestic  
information markets;   

- toughened international competition for information technologies and resources;   

- activities of international terrorist organizations;   

- an increase in the technological edge of leading world powers and the buildup of their  
ability to hinder the creation of competitive Russian information technologies;   

- space, air, sea and land technical and other means (types) of reconnaissance activities on  
the part of foreign states;   

- development by a number of states of information war concepts that provide for creating  
means for dangerous attack on the information spheres of other countries of the world,  
disturbing the normal functioning of their information and telecommunication systems,  
breaching the security of their information resources and gaining unsanctioned access to  
them.   

To the internal sources belong:   

- a critical state of national branches of industry;   

- an unfavorable criminogenic situation accompanied by tendencies for coalescence  
between state and criminal structures in the information sphere, for criminal structures to  
gain access to confidential information, for greater influence of organized crime on the life  
of society, for a decrease in the level of protection of the lawful interests of citizens, society  
and the state in the information sphere;   

- insufficient coordination among the federal bodies of state authority and the bodies of  
state authority of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation in shaping and carrying  
out a unified state policy in the realm of national information security;   

- an insufficient degree of development of the legal and regulatory base governing relations  
in the information sphere, and inadequate law enforcement practices;   

----------------------- Page 8-----------------------

- the immaturity of civil society institutions, and insufficient state control over the  
development of the Russian information market;   

- insufficient financing for measures aimed at ensuring the information security of the  
Russian Federation;   

- insufficient economic power of the state;   

- the decline in efficiency of the system of education and upbringing, insufficient numbers of  
qualified personnel in the realm of information security;   

- insufficient vigor of federal bodies of state authority or bodies of state authority of  
constituent entities of the Russian Federation in informing society about their activities, in  
explaining their decisions, in forming open government resources and in developing a  
system of access to them for citizens;   

- Russia’s lag behind the world’s leading countries in level of informatization of federal  
bodies of state authority, the bodies of state authority of the constituent entities of the  
Russian Federation and bodies of local-self government, the financial and credit sphere,  
industry, agriculture, education, public health, and consumer services.   

4. The state of information security of the Russian Federation and the main  
challenges in its assurance   

In recent years the Russian Federation has carried out a set of measures to improve its  
information security.   

Shaping a legal framework for information security has begun. The State Secrets Law and  
the Fundamental National Archives and Records Legislation of the Russian Federation,  
along with the Federal Laws on Information, Informatization and Information Protection and  
on Participation in International Information Exchange and a number of other laws, have  
been adopted, and work has been launched to create the relevant implementation  
mechanisms and to craft laws governing public relations in the information sphere.   

Information security measures have been carried out in the federal bodies of state  
authority, in the bodies of state authority of the constituent entities of the Russian  
Federation and in enterprises, institutions and organizations under whatever form of  
ownership. Work has been launched to set up a protected special-purpose information  
technology system in the interests of the bodies of state authority.   

The successful tackling of information security issues in the Russian Federation is aided by  
the national system of information protection, the system for protecting state secrets, the  
systems for licensing activities in the field of the protection of state secrets and the systems  
for certifying information protection tools.   

Yet analysis of the state of information security in the Russian Federation shows that its  
level is not fully consistent with the requirements of society and the state.   

The current political and socioeconomic development conditions in the country give rise to  
sharp contradictions between the requirements of society in a wider free exchange of  

----------------------- Page 9-----------------------

information and the necessity of retaining individual regulated limitations on its  
dissemination.   

The contradictory nature and immaturity of the legal governance of social relations in the  
information sphere lead to serious negative consequences. Thus, the insufficiency of a  
legal and regulatory framework for relations in the field of realization of the possibilities for  
constitutional restrictions on mass media freedom in the interests of protecting the  
foundations of the constitutional system and the morality, health, rights and lawful interests  
of citizens, ensuring national defense capability and state security considerably impede the  
maintenance of a balance of interests among the individual, society and the state in the  
information sphere. Imperfect legal and normative governance of relations in the field of  
mass information hampers the establishment of competitive Russian news agencies and  
media within the territory of the Russian Federation.   

The precariousness of citizens’ rights to information access, and information manipulation  
evoke a negative reaction among people, which in a number of cases leads to a  
destabilization of the social and political situation in society.   

The constitutionally enshrined rights of citizens to the inviolability of private life, to personal  
and family privacy and the privacy of correspondence essentially do not have a sufficient  
legal, organizational and technical backing. Unsatisfactorily organized is the protection of  
personal data referring to natural persons that are collected by federal bodies of state  
authority, those of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation and bodies of local  
self-government.   

The lack of efficiency in pursuing a state policy in efforts to create the Russian information  
space, develop the mass information system, organize international information exchange  
and integrate the Russian information space into the world information space engenders  
conditions for ousting Russian news agencies and media from the national information  
market and for distorting the structure of international information exchange.   

Insufficient is government support to the activities of Russian news agencies in promoting  
their products to the foreign information market.   

The situation with ensuring the security of data that constitute state secrets is deteriorating.   

Serious damage has been inflicted upon the cadre potential of scientific and production  
collectives operating in the development and manufacture of informatization,  
telecommunication and communication means owing to their most qualified specialists’  
departure therefrom.   

The lag of national information technologies forces the federal bodies of state authority,  
bodies of state authority of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation and bodies of  
local self-government to purchase import equipment when establishing information systems  
and to enlist foreign firms, because of which the likelihood of unsanctioned access to the  
information being processed increases and Russia’s dependence on foreign computer and  
telecommunication hardware and software manufacturers grows.   

In the wake of an intensive introduction of foreign information technologies in the areas of  
activity of the individual, society and the state, and following the wide use of open  
information technology systems and the integration of national information systems and  
international information systems the threats of the use of the “information weapon” against  

----------------------- Page 10-----------------------

the Russian information infrastructure have increased. Work on an adequate and  
comprehensive response to these threats is being conducted with insufficient coordination  
and poor budget financing. Not enough attention is being given to the development of  
space reconnaissance and electronic warfare systems.   

The resultant state of affairs in the area of information security in the Russian Federation  
requires an immediate solution of such tasks as:   

- developing basic guidelines for state policy in the area of information security in the  
Russian Federation as well as measures and mechanisms connected with the  
implementation of this policy;   

- developing and improving the national information security system that realizes a unified  
state policy in this field, including upgrading the forms, methods and techniques of  
identification, assessment and prediction of information security threats, along with the  
system to counteract these threats;   

- developing federal purpose-oriented programs of ensuring the information security of the  
Russian Federation;   

- developing criteria and methods for assessing the effectiveness of, and certifying national  
information security systems and means;   

- streamlining the legal and regulatory base for national information security, including the  
mechanisms for realizing citizens’ rights to obtain and access information, and the forms  
and methods for carrying out the legal norms concerning state-media interaction;   

- the establishment of the responsibility of officials of the federal bodies of state authority,  
bodies of state authority of the constituent entities, bodies of local self-government and of  
legal entities and citizens for the observance of information security requirements;   

- coordinating the activities of the federal bodies of state authority, the bodies of state  
authority of the constituent entities, enterprises, institutions and organizations under  
whatever form of ownership in the field of ensuring the information security of the Russian  
Federation;   

- developing the theoretical and practical foundations of national information security  
assurance with regard for the current geopolitical situation, Russia’s political and  
socioeconomic development conditions and the reality of the use of the “information  
weapon”;   

- crafting and setting up mechanisms to shape and implement the state information policy  
of Russia;   

- developing methods for raising the effectiveness of state participation in shaping the  
information policy of state television and radio broadcasting organizations and other state- 
run mass media;   

- securing the technological independence of the Russian Federation in the major areas of  
informatization, telecommunications and communication determining its security, and  

----------------------- Page 11-----------------------

primarily in the field of developing specialized computer hardware for weapon and military  
equipment specimens;   

- devising contemporary methods and tools for protecting information and securing  
information technologies, primarily those used in troop and weapons control systems and in  
management systems for environmentally hazardous and economically important  
enterprises;   

- developing and improving the state system of information protection and the system for  
the protection of state secrets;   

- creating and developing a contemporary protected technological base of government in  
peacetime, in emergencies and in wartime;   

- expanding cooperation with international and foreign agencies and organizations in  
dealing with scientific-technical and legal issues in securing information that is transmitted  
with the aid of international telecommunication and communication systems;   

- providing conditions for active development of the Russian information infrastructure and  
for the participation of Russia in the processes of the creation and use of global information  
networks and systems;   

- creating a unified system of personnel training in the area of information security and  
information technologies.

security of the Russian Federation in the most important spheres of life and activity of  
society and the state.   

The economic methods for ensuring the information security of the Russian  
Federation include:   

- the development of national information security programs and determination of the  
procedure for their financing;   

- improvements in the system of financing for efforts to implement the legal and  
organizational-technical methods for information protection and the creation of the system  
of insurance of information risks of natural and legal persons.   

6. Features of assurance of the information security of the Russian Federation in  
different areas of public life   

The information security of the Russian Federation is one of the ingredients of the national  
security of the Russian Federation and exerts influence on the degree of protection of its  
national interests in different spheres of activity by society and the state. The threats to and  
methods for ensuring national information security are common to these spheres.   

Each of them has its own specifics of ensuring information security, deriving from the  
specifics of security assurance facilities and their degree of vulnerability in respect of  
threats to the information security of the Russian Federation. In every sphere of activity by  
society and the state use can be made of private methods and forms determined by the  
specifics of the factors influencing the state of national information security in tandem with  
general methods for ensuring the information security of the Russian Federation.   

In the economy sphere – Ensuring the information security of the Russian Federation in  
the economy sphere plays a key role in ensuring its national security.   

The following are most susceptible to national information security threats in the economy  
sphere:   

- the system of state statistics;   

- the financial and credit system;   

- automated information and accounting systems of subdivisions of federal executive  
bodies ensuring the activities of society and the state in the economy sphere;   

- systems of financial accounting of enterprises, institutions and organizations under  
whatever form of ownership;   

----------------------- Page 14-----------------------

- systems of gathering, processing, storage and transmission of financial, stock exchange,  
tax, customs information and information on the foreign economic activity of the state as  
well as of enterprises, institutions and organizations under whatever form of ownership.   

The transition to market relations in the economy has brought about the appearance in the  
Russian internal goods and services market of a multitude of national and foreign  
commercial structures: information and informatization and information protection tool  
producers and consumers. Uncontrolled activity by these structures in developing,  
manufacturing and protecting the systems of gathering, processing, storage and  
transmission of statistical, financial, stock exchange, tax and customs information creates a  
real threat to the security of Russia in the economy sphere. Similar threats arise with the  
uncontrolled attraction of foreign firms to creating such systems, as in this case favorable  
conditions take shape for unsanctioned access to confidential economic information and for  
monitoring its transfer and processing by foreign special services.   

The critical state of enterprises of the national industries developing and manufacturing  
informatization, telecommunications, communication and information protection tools leads  
to extensive use of the relevant imported tools, which creates a danger of origination of  
Russian technological dependence on foreign states.   

Computer crimes involving penetration by criminal elements into computer systems and  
networks of banks and other credit organizations pose a serious threat to the normal  
functioning of the economy as a whole.   

The insufficiency of the legal and regulatory base that determines the liability of business  
entities for the unauthenticity or concealment of data on their commercial activities, on the  
consumer properties of the goods and services they produce, on the results of their  
economic activity, on their investments and so on hinders the normal functioning of the  
business entities. On the other hand, business entities may suffer substantial economic  
damage as a result of the divulgence of trade secrets information. In the systems of  
gathering, processing, storage and transmission of financial, stock exchange, tax and  
customs information the most dangerous are the illegal copying of information and its  
distortion as a consequence of deliberate or inadvertent violations of the technology for  
handling, and unsanctioned access to information. This also concerns the federal executive  
bodies engaged in the formation and distribution of information on the foreign economic  
activity of the Russian Federation.   

The principal measures for ensuring the information security of the Russian Federation in  
the economy sphere are as follows:   

- organizing and exercising state control over the creation, development and protection of  
systems and tools for gathering, processing, storage and transmission of statistical,  
financial, stock exchange, tax and customs information;   

- radical restructuring of the system of state statistical reports so as to ensure the  
authenticity, completeness and security of information, carried out by introducing strict legal  
responsibility of officials for the preparation of primary information, organizing control over  
these officials’ activities and those of statistical information processing and analysis  
services and restricting the commercialization of such information;   

----------------------- Page 15-----------------------

- development of national certified tools for information protection and their introduction in  
systems and tools for the gathering, processing, storage and transmission of statistical,  
financial, stock exchange, tax and customs information;   

- development and introduction of national protected electronic payment systems on the  
basis of smart cards, electronic money and electronic commerce systems, the  
standardization of these systems and the elaboration of a legal and regulatory base  
governing their use;   

- improvement of the legal and regulatory base governing information relations in the  
economy sphere;   

- streamlining the methods of selection and training of personnel for work in economic  
information gathering, processing, storage and transmission systems.   

In the domestic policy sphere – The most important Russian information security targets

work on the neutralization of the disinformation being spread there about the foreign policy  
of the Russian Federation;   

- perfecting the information support of the work on counteracting abuses of the rights and  
freedoms of Russian citizens and legal entities abroad;   

- better information support to the constituent entities of the Russian Federation with  
respect to foreign policy activity issues that fall within their competence.   

In the field of science and technology – The most important Russian information security  
targets in the science and technology field are:   

- fundamental, exploratory and applied research results potentially important for the techno- 
scientific, technological and socioeconomic development of the country, including  
information whose loss may inflict damage upon the national interests and prestige of the  
Russian Federation;   

- discoveries, unpatented technologies, industrial designs, useful models and experimental  
equipment;   

- scientific and technical cadres and the system for their training;   

- management systems for integrated research complexes (nuclear reactors, particle  
accelerators, plasma generators, and others).   

The following are principal categorizable external threats to Russian information security in  
the field of science and technology:   

- the striving of developed foreign states to get illegal access to scientific and technical  
resources of Russia in order to use the results obtained by Russian scientists in their own  
interests;   

- the creation of preferential conditions for foreign techno-scientific products in the Russian  
market and a simultaneous striving by developed countries to limit the development of  
Russia’s techno-scientific potential (buying up shares of advanced enterprises with their  
subsequent refocusing, keeping export and import restrictions and so on);   

- the policy of western countries aimed at further destroying the unified techno-scientific  
space inherited from the USSR, of the member states of the Commonwealth of  

----------------------- Page 18-----------------------

Independent States through refocusing onto western countries their scientific and technical  
ties as well as individual, most promising scientific collectives;   

- the step-up of activity by foreign state and commercial enterprises, institutions and  
organizations in the field of industrial espionage with the enlistment of intelligence and  
special services in it.   

The following are principal categorizable internal threats to Russian information security in  
the field of science and technology:   

- the lingering complicated economic situation in Russia, leading to a sharp drop in the  
financing of scientific and technical activities, a temporary decline in the prestige of the  
techno-scientific sphere and the outflow of ideas and advanced developments;   

- the inability of national electronic industry plants to produce on the basis of newest  
microelectronics achievements and advanced information technologies competitive  
science-intensive products helping provide a sufficient level of Russian technological  
independence from foreign countries, which necessitates wide use of import hardware &  
software in setting up and advancing the information infrastructure in Russia;   

- the serious problems in the field of patent protection of the results of scientific and  
technical activities of Russian scientists;   

- the difficulties in carrying out information protection measures, especially in corporatized  
enterprises and in techno-scientific institutions and organizations.   

The real way to counteract information security threats to the Russian Federation in the  
field of science and technology is to streamline national legislation governing relations in  
this sphere, and the implementation mechanisms for it. Toward this end the state must  
promote the creation of a system for assessment of likely damage from the realization of  
threats to the most important Russian information security facilities in the field of science  
and technology, including public research councils and independent expertise organizations  
working out recommendations for the bodies of state authority, both federal and in the  
constituent entities of the Federation, on the prevention of illegal or ineffective use of  
Russia’s intellectual potential.   

In the sphere of spiritual life – Ensuring national information security in the sphere of  
spiritual life aims to protect the constitutional rights and freedoms of man and the citizen  
associated with the development, formation and behavior of the individual, with freedom of  
mass information and use of the cultural, spiritual and moral legacy, historical traditions,  
and the norms of social life, with the preservation of the cultural wealth of all of Russia’s  
peoples and with the realization of constitutional restrictions on human and civil rights and  
freedoms in the interests of keeping up and strengthening the moral values of society, the  
traditions of patriotism and humanism, the health of citizens, the cultural and scientific  
potential of the Russian Federation and of ensuring the nation’s security and defense  
capabilities.   

The most important Russian information security targets in the sphere of spiritual life are:   

- the dignity of the person, freedom of conscience, including the right freely to choose,  
possess and disseminate religious or other beliefs, and to act in conformity with them,  
freedom of thought and speech (with the exception of propaganda or campaigning inciting

External threats representing the greatest danger to information security facilities in the  
law enforcement and judicial spheres are:   

----------------------- Page 24-----------------------

- intelligence activities by special services of foreign states and by international criminal  
confederations, organizations and groups involving the gathering of information that reveals  
the objectives, activity plans, technical equipment, methods of work and places of  
deployment of special units and interior bodies of the Russian Federation;   

- activities by foreign state and private commercial entities seeking to get unsanctioned  
access to information resources of law enforcement and judicial bodies.   

Internal threats representing the greatest danger to the said facilities are:   

- violation of the established regulations for the gathering, processing, storage and  
transmission of information held in files and automated databanks and used for crime  
investigation;   

- insufficient legislative and normative regulation of the exchange of information in the law

and automated databanks.   

Along with the widely used general methods and tools of information protection, specific  
methods and tools for ensuring information security in the law enforcement and juridical  
spheres are also applied.   

Chief among them being:   

- the creation of a protected multilevel system of integrated databanks of an investigative,  
reference, criminalistic and statistical nature on the basis of specialized information  
technology systems;   

- upgrading the level of professional and special training of information system users.   

In the conditions of emergency situations – The most vulnerable information security  
facilities in the Russian Federation in the conditions of emergency situations are the  
disaster relief and emergency response decision making system, and the system for the  
gathering and processing of information on the likelihood of emergency situations.   

Of special importance to the normal functioning of the said facilities is the assurance of  
national information infrastructure security in the event of accidents, disasters and  
calamities. The concealment, receipt in delay, distortion or destruction of operational  
information, and unsanctioned assess to it by individuals or groups of individuals may lead  
to a loss of human lives as well as to the origination of different kinds of complexities in the  
elimination of the consequences of an emergency situation deriving from the specificities of  
informational influence under extreme conditions; to setting in motion large masses people  

----------------------- Page 25-----------------------

experiencing psychic stress; and to a quick rise and spread of panic and commotion among  
them on the basis of rumors and false or untrustworthy information.   

In respect of these conditions, the specific thrust areas for efforts to ensure information  
security include:   

- the development of an effective system of monitoring the objects of enhanced potential  
danger, whose disruption may cause emergency situations, and of forecasting emergency  
situations;   

- the improvement of the system by which the public is informed about the dangers of  
outbreak of emergencies and about the conditions of their origination and development;   

- enhancing the reliability of the information processing and transmission systems ensuring  
the activities of federal executive bodies;   

- prediction of the behavior of the population under the influence of false or untrustworthy  
information about possible emergency situations and the elaboration of measures to help  
large masses of people in the conditions of these situations;   

- the development of special measures for the protection of the information systems  
ensuring management of environmentally dangerous and economically important  
enterprises.   

7. International cooperation by the Russian Federation in the realm of information  
security   

International cooperation by the Russian Federation in the realm of information security is  
an integral part of political, military, economic, cultural, and other interactions among the  
countries which form the world community. Such cooperation must help enhance the  
information security of all members of the world community, including the Russian  
Federation.   

A feature of international cooperation by the Russian Federation in the realm of information  
security is that it occurs in the conditions of toughened international competition for  
technological and information resources and for market dominance, coupled with continued  
attempts at creating a structure of international relations based on unilateral solutions to  
key problems in world politics, at resisting the consolidation of Russia’s role as one of the  
influential centers in an emerging multipolar world, at increasing the technological edge of  
leading world powers and at building up their capabilities to create the “information  
weapon.” All of this may lead to a new stage of the arms race in the information sphere and  
to the mounting danger of spying and operational technical penetration into Russia by  
foreign intelligence services, particularly with the use of the global information  
infrastructure.   

The major thrust areas for international cooperation by the Russian Federation in the  
realm of information security are:   

- prohibiting the development, spread and use of the “information weapon”;   

----------------------- Page 26-----------------------

- securing the international exchange of information, including information flows via national  
telecommunication and communication channels;   

- coordination of computer crime prevention activities by law enforcement agencies of the  
countries which form the world community;   

- prevention of unsanctioned access to confidential information in international banking  
telecommunication networks and world trade information support systems and to  
information of international law enforcement organizations waging a struggle against  
transnational organized crime, international terrorism, the spread of narcotic drugs and  
psychotropic substances, the illegal trade in arms and fissile material, and human  
trafficking.   

In maintaining international cooperation by the Russian Federation in the realm of  
information security, special attention should be paid to problems of interaction with the  
member states of the Commonwealth of Independent States.   

For this cooperation to be accomplished in the aforesaid major areas the active  
participation of Russia should be ensured in all the international organizations engaged in  
activities in the realm of information security, particularly in the field of the standardization  
and certification of informatization and information protection tools.   

III. THE MAIN PROPOSITIONS OF RUSSIAN STATE INFORMATION SECURITY  
POLICY AND URGENT MEASURES TO REALIZE IT   

8. The main propositions of Russian state information security policy   

The RF state information security policy defines the main thrusts of activities to be pursued  
by the federal bodies of state authority and by the bodies of state authority of the  
constituent entities of the Russian Federation in this field, the procedure for assigning their  
responsibilities in protecting the interests of the Russian Federation in the information  
sphere within the thrust areas and rests on the observance of a balance of interests among  
the individual, society and the state in the information sphere.   

The RF state information security policy is based on the following main principles:   

- observance of the Russian Federation Constitution and laws and of the generally  
recognized principles and norms of international law in carrying out activities to ensure  
national information security;   

- openness in realizing the functions of the federal bodies of state authority, the bodies of  
state authority of the constituent entities of the Russian Federation and public associations,  
that envisages the provision of information to the public about their activities with regard for  
the restrictions established by the legislation of the Russian Federation;   

- the legal equality of all participants in the information interaction process regardless of  
their political, social or economic status, predicated on the constitutional right of citizens  
freely to seek, get, transmit, produce and disseminate information in any legal way;   

- priority boost for modern RF information and telecommunication technologies, the  
production of hardware and software capable of ensuring the improvement of national  

----------------------- Page 27-----------------------

telecommunication networks, and their connection to global information networks with a  
view to the observance of Russia’s vital interests.   

The state in the course of the realization of its functions of ensuring the information security  
of the Russian Federation:   

- carries out an objective and comprehensive analysis and prediction of threats to the  
information security of the Russian Federation, and works out measures for its assurance;   

- organizes work of the legislative (representative) and executive bodies of state authority of  
the Russian Federation to implement a set of measures aimed at preventing, repulsing and  
neutralizing threats to national information security;   

- supports the activities of public associations aimed at providing objective information to  
the population about socially significant events of public life and protecting society against  
distorted and untrustworthy information;   

- exercises control over the design, manufacture, development, use, export and import of  
information protection tools by means of their certification and the licensing of activities in  
the field of information protection;   

- pursues a requisite protectionist policy toward informatization and information protection  
tool producers within Russia, and takes measures to protect the domestic market against  
the penetration of inferior informatization tools and information products into it;   

- facilitates granting access to world information resources and global information networks  
for natural and legal persons;   

- articulates and implements Russia’s state information policy;   

- organizes development of a federal program to assure the information security of the  
Russian Federation combining the efforts of state and non-state organizations in this field;   

- promotes the internationalization of global information networks and systems, and  
Russia’s entry into the world information community on terms of an equal partnership.   

Streamlining the legal mechanisms governing social relations arising in the information  
sphere is a priority thrust of state policy in the field of ensuring the information security of  
the Russian Federation.   

This presupposes:   

- effectiveness assessment of the application of current legislative and other normative  
legal acts in the information sphere, and elaboration of a program for their improvement;   

- the establishment of institutional mechanisms for the assurance of information security;   

- determining the legal status of all parties to relations in the information sphere, including  
information and telecommunication system users, and establishing their responsibility for  
the observance of the Russian Federation laws in this sphere;   

----------------------- Page 28-----------------------

- the creation of a system for the gathering and analysis of data on sources of threats to the  
information security of the Russian Federation, and on the implications of their  
accomplishment;   

- the crafting of normative legal acts determining the organization of investigation and the  
procedure for judicial examination of illegal actions in the information sphere, and the rule  
on eliminating the consequences thereof;   

- the elaboration of formal elements of a definition of law violations with regard for the  
specifics of criminal, civil, administrative and disciplinary liability, and the inclusion of the  
appropriate legal norms into the criminal, civil, administrative and labor codes and into the  
Russian Federation civil service laws;   

- improvements in the system for the training of personnel used in the field of ensuring the  
information security of the Russian Federation.   

Legal support to national information security should primarily be based on the observance  
of the principles of legality and of a balance of interests among citizens, society and the  
state in the information sphere.   

The observance of the principle of legality requires that the federal bodies of state authority  
and those of the constituent entities should be strictly guided when resolving conflicts that  
may arise in the information sphere by the legislative and other normative legal acts  
governing relations in this sphere.   

The observance of the principle of a balance of interests among citizens, society and the  
state in the information sphere presupposes legislative enshrinement of these interests in  
different areas of the functioning of society, and the use of forms of public control of the  
activities of the federal bodies of state authority and those of the constituent entities of the  
Russian Federation. Realizing the guarantees for the constitutional rights of man and the  
citizen concerning activities in the information sphere is a major task of the state in the  
realm of information security.   

Elaborating the mechanisms of legal support to national information security includes  
measures to informatize the legal sphere as a whole.   

To identify and harmonize the interests of the federal bodies of state authority, the bodies of  
state authority of the constituent entities, and other parties to relations in the information  
sphere and to craft requisite decisions, the state supports the formation of public councils,  
committees and commissions with broad representation of public organizations, and  
facilitates organizing their effective work.
