                                                           The digital domain or cyberspace  is the fifth domain for military operations, along with  
                                                           air, sea, land and space. This domain and the use of digital assets as weapons or  
                                                            intelligence instruments are without a doubt evolving rapidly. Digital assets will

                                                           the same time, the growing dependency on digital assets also creates vulnerabilities  
                                                           which require urgent attention. A large-scale cyber attack could have an enormous impact  
                                                            on society. As is the case with terror attacks, cyber attacks can cause great upheaval and  
                                                           widespread social disruption. Within the military domain, the infrastructure and weapon  
                                                           systems can be affected in such a way that an effective defence is no longer possible. The  
                                                            Netherlands armed forces have drawn the necessary conclusions from this and aspire to  
                                                           fulfil their military role in cyberspace, too. 

                                                           The three core tasks of the Defence organisation are leading for the armed forces’ efforts  
                                                            in cyberspace.2 The armed forces must therefore be capable of taking action against  

                                                            digital threats to our society or to the international rule of law. There is an increasing  
                                                            overlap between the first and the third core tasks. However, because the principles and  
                                                           the procedures for the deployment of the armed forces differ for each of the core tasks,  
                                                           the distinction between them continues to be important. Political-constitutional relations  
                                                           apply equally in cyberspace. Deployment of the armed forces for international operations  
                                                           therefore takes place on the basis of a government mandate, while deployment for

                                                        The dependence of the armed forces on digital technology, however, also makes them  
                                                        vulnerable. It is crucial for the Defence organisation to safeguard the reliability3 of its own  

                                                         networks, systems and information and to take measures to prevent the theft of

                                                         Since the digital systems of our (potential) opponents are also vulnerable, cyberspace can

                                                         intelligence position. The Defence organisation therefore explicitly considers digital  
                                                         assets as operational capabilities, i.e. as weapons or as intelligence assets, which must be  
                                                         incorporated in the operational capabilities of the armed forces as a whole. This concerns

                                                         using digital technology. Since intensive use is made of IT assets throughout the Defence  
                                                         organisation, far-reaching joint cooperation is required.

                                                         Given the interconnectivity within cyberspace and the dependence on similar technology,  
                                                         a comprehensive approach is called for at both the national and international level. The

                                                     The biggest threat to Defence in cyberspace in the medium term is presented by  
                                                     sophisticated and complex digital offensive capabilities directed against a specific  
                                                     military target. Such an attack could potentially severely limit the armed forces’  
                                                     freedom of action. A lack of knowledge about and insight into the possibilities for  
                                                     conducting cyber attacks constitutes a real risk to the armed forces. 

                                                     Already, armed forces and industry involved in the development and production of

                                                     digital attacks and espionage activities. The strategic and economic value of  
                                                     information in this field is great. Furthermore, the Defence organisation will have to  
                                                     be alert from an early stage to clandestine introduction of vulnerable spots

                                                        The point of departure is that Defence cyber capabilities form an important and viable  
                                                        addition to existing military capabilities. The strength of cyber assets lies in the possibili-

                                                        assets strengthen the armed forces’ actions for all military functions: logistics, command

                                                        Strategy is therefore based on a comprehensive approach, both in terms of the suppor- 
                                                        ting processes (force generation, operational support, sustainment) and in terms of

                                                        Military operations will increasingly involve the use of operational cyber capabilities,  
                                                        mainly in support of the armed forces’ regular operations, but also as a weapon in its own  
                                                        right. Operational cyber capabilities must become an integral part of the overall military  
                                                        capability of the Netherlands armed forces. The Defence organisation must therefore  
                                                        invest substantially in strengthening its cyber capabilities. The Defence organisation will  
                                                        not, however, establish a separate Service for operations in cyberspace. In 2014, the  
                                                        relevant cyber capabilities will be incorporated within the joint Defence Cyber Command  
                                                        which will come under the single-service management of the Royal Netherlands Army. 

                                                        An operational cyber capability encompasses all knowledge and assets necessary to

                                                        using digital technology, and to protect against similar operations conducted by oppo-

                                                        systems. An operational cyber capability thus encompasses deployable defensive,

                                                        In planning and preparing for operations, all aspects relevant to cyberspace are taken into  
                                                        account. Cyberspace thus forms an integral element of the joint operational planning  
                                                        process. In this process, attention is given to the potential influence of cyberspace on the

                                                        operational commander therefore has his own capabilities at his disposal and can call

                                                Defence organisation’s generic networks and systems, and by the Defence Cyber  
                                                Command to protect operational networks and systems during deployment. The Defence  
                                                organisation will also enhance the reliability of weapon and sensor systems by improving  
                                                insight into digital vulnerabilities and by tightening supervision of the development,  
                                                supply chain and use of IT components. Special attention will be paid to cyber defence in

                                                systems, potential risks pertaining to the reliability of those systems must be taken into  
                                                account right from the outset. These risks must then be mitigated, if possible, with the

Offensive 

                                                  Offensive cyber capabilities are capabilities aimed at influencing or disabling the actions  
                                                  of an opponent. The Defence organisation must have sufficient knowledge and  
                                                  capabilities at its disposal to be able to conduct offensive operations in cyberspace, with a  
                                                  view to conducting an effective defence and to support operations. 

                                                  This concerns the development of complex and high-tech assets and methods, including  
                                                  the relevant expertise, that are specifically aimed at increasing our own military capability.  
                                                  A cyber attack on an air defence system may thus increase the effectiveness of an air  
                                                  attack while reducing the risk of collateral damage.  

                                                  An offensive cyber capability can be a force multiplier and thus increase the armed forces’  
                                                  effectiveness. By developing a robust cyber capability, the Netherlands can play an  
                                                  important role within NATO in this respect.  

                                                  Internationally, the development of offensive operational cyber capabilities is still in its  
                                                  infancy. A great deal is still unclear about the nature of these capabilities, the possibilities  
                                                  they may offer and the effects they can achieve. Offensive cyber capabilities are  
                                                  distinguished from conventional military capabilities in that they can often be used only  
                                                  once and generally have a limited service life. High-quality cyber capabilities hardly bear  
                                                  comparison with generally known, relatively easy-to-use and widespread methods of  
                                                  attack. They are complex assets and developing them requires a high level of knowledge,  
                                                  making them costly and time-consuming. The fact that the opponent may at any time  
                                                  discover his own vulnerabilities and address them means that achievement of the desired  
                                                  effects cannot be guaranteed.  

                                                  In developing offensive operational capabilities, optimal use will be made of the expertise  
                                                  and assets of the Defence Intelligence & Security Service (DISS). Given the scarcity of  
                                                  qualified personnel, both the expertise and the assets must be deployed as efficiently as  
                                                  possible and duplication of efforts in asset development in the Defence organisation  
                                                  must be avoided. Optimal use must therefore be made of the expertise, assets and  
                                                  contacts of the DISS to enable the development and deployment of offensive assets by  
                                                  the Chief of Defence (CHOD). The CHOD may deploy these offensive assets in a military  
                                                  operation on the basis of a mandate from the government, leaving intact, as required by  
                                                  law, the division between the tasks and responsibilities of the CHOD and the DISS. In  
                                                  addition, offensive assets can be deployed to prevent or stop a cyber attack and to  
                                                  guarantee our own freedom of action in military operations in cyberspace (‘active  
                                                  defence’). The Defence Cyber Command will ensure the deployment readiness of  
                                                  offensive cyber capabilities. The Cyber Task Force will formulate a doctrine for operations  
                                                  in cyberspace, develop deployment scenarios, and describe the effects and consequences  
                                                  of offensive assets in more detail. This will be done with the help of tests, training and  
                                                  exercises.

Intelligence 

                                                  The rapidly increasing influence of cyberspace and the increased intertwinement of  
                                                  systems have greatly expanded the possibilities for information-gathering. Having a  
                                                  high-quality intelligence position in cyberspace is a precondition both to protecting our  
                                                  own infrastructure and to conducting operations. The Defence organisation needs to  
                                                  have a clear insight into the cyber threats it may be exposed to in order to be able to  
                                                  protect itself effectively against those threats. This requires knowledge of the technical  
                                                  threat itself as well as insight into the possibilities and intentions of – potential – oppo- 
                                                  nents and attackers. The DISS therefore needs to have the intelligence capabilities to  
                                                  acquire and analyse this information and to report on it in a timely fashion. Furthermore,  
                                                  the DISS must have the capability to disrupt and stop the intelligence activities of others.  
                                                  The DISS’ intelligence activities in cyberspace are, of course, conducted within the  
                                                  parameters of the law. 

                                                  In the coming years, the DISS will expand its capability for the covert gathering of  
                                                  information in cyberspace. This includes infiltration of computers and networks to  
                                                  acquire data, mapping out relevant sections of cyberspace, monitoring vital networks,  
                                                  and gaining a profound understanding of the functioning of and technology behind  
                                                  offensive cyber assets. The gathered information will be used for early-warning intelli-

                                                  production in general, and conducting counterintelligence activities. Cyber intelligence  
                                                  capabilities cannot be regarded in isolation from intelligence capabilities such as signals  
                                                  intelligence (SIGINT), human intelligence (HUMINT) and the DISS’ existing counterintel- 
                                                  ligence capability. A decisive factor for the effectiveness of operations is the combined  
                                                  deployment of scarce expertise and assets. With that in mind, the DISS and the GISS  
                                                  (General Intelligence and Security Service) are intensifying their cooperation in the areas  
                                                  of cyber and SIGINT by establishing a joint SIGINT-Cyber Unit. The establishment of this  
                                                  unit should further improve the effectiveness of the national cyber intelligence capability.  
                                                  The DISS will also contribute to the further development of the National Cyber Security  
                                                  Assessment which is being formulated under the responsibility of the National  
                                                  Coordinator for Counterterrorism and Security of the Ministry of Security and Justice.  

                                                  A complex challenge in the cyber context is the attribution of attacks and attempted  
                                                  attacks. If it is not possible to identify the origin, perpetrator and objective of an attack,  
                                                  the possibilities for responding effectively are limited. By using all intelligence sources at  
                                                  its disposal as well as forensic investigation, the DISS will improve the possibilities for  
                                                  attribution and cooperate closely with the Joint Information Management Command, the

                                                  National Police Services Agency and the Royal Netherlands Marechaussee). In addition,  
                                                  intensive confidential international cooperation is often essential for being able to  
                                                  eventually establish the identity of the attacker and take effective protective measures.

                                                 The speed at which developments in cyberspace occur places high demands on the  
                                                  Defence organisation’s adaptability and innovative strength. It must be able to rapidly  
                                                  implement new technologies and complete short innovation cycles in cyberspace. The  
                                                 dynamics and complexity of cyberspace require constant adaptation of the initial  
                                                  requirements for knowledge, expertise, skills and techniques, and the modi operandi.  

                                                 The Defence organisation must possess the necessary knowledge to follow relevant  
                                                 developments and to respond to them quickly and effectively. It invests in people,  
                                                 technology, research and development so as to be able to procure or develop and  
                                                  implement the necessary cyber capabilities in a timely fashion. The Defence Cyber  
                                                  Expertise Centre (DCEC) is to become the central entity for the promotion of knowledge  
                                                 development, knowledge retention and knowledge dissemination. The DCEC must bring  
                                                 the knowledge of the Defence organisation in the field of cyber operations up to a high  
                                                  level and maintain that level. It is aimed at both knowledge development (including  
                                                  research & development and concept development and experimentation) and the  
                                                 transfer of knowledge (exercise, training and instruction) within the Defence organisation.  
                                                 The DCEC will cooperate closely with knowledge institutes, such as the Netherlands

                                                  In order to permanently improve the security of networks and systems, the Defence  
                                                 organisation must be able to respond quickly and effectively to new developments, to  
                                                 test new techniques at an early stage and to work together closely with the business and  
                                                 science communities. Tendering and procurement procedures for cyber-related materiel  
                                                 and services are to be set up in such a way that the hybrid and changeable character of  
                                                 this domain can be tackled proactively while, at the same time, guaranteeing the  
                                                  reliability of assets and operating processes. In cyberspace, the private sector is the driver  
                                                 of innovation, including in the areas of security and protection of the IT infrastructure.  
                                                 The Defence organisation should therefore make optimal use of this innovative strength.  
                                                 The Defence organisation’s sourcing policy can make a contribution in this regard.

                                                  Defence organisation and also by partners. These elements can be situated at various  
                                                  physical locations and connected from a distance. 

                                                 A particular challenge for the Defence organisation is to recruit and retain qualified  
                                                  personnel who are also able to perform in a military environment. The required military  
                                                  personnel capacity will be realised partly through the recruitment of cyber reserve  
                                                  personnel. In order to acquire and retain the required knowledge, competence and skills  
                                                 for the organisation, particular attention will be given to personnel policy and training.  
                                                  For example, specific career patterns will be developed to embed and further develop the  
                                                  knowledge and expertise of Defence personnel in the field of cyber. Exchange of  
                                                  personnel may be promoted by cooperating with the NCSC, criminal investigation  
                                                 services and the business community. This ensures that personnel can gain the required  
                                                 experience and at the same time provides them with an interesting career perspective.

Cooperation 

                                                   Cyber security depends on the ability of countries and organisations to protect  
                                                   cyberspace, individually and collectively. Cyberspace is by definition an area where both  
                                                   public and private, civilian and military, and national and international actors act  
                                                   simultaneously and are mutually dependent. In addition, the techniques used by  
                                                   attackers are largely similar and designed to exploit generic vulnerabilities of networks  
                                                   and systems. A joint approach to cyber threats is therefore required in order to increase  
                                                   cyber security in a sustainable manner.  

                                                   At home 
                                                   As part of the National Cyber Security Strategy (NCSS), the Defence organisation needs to  
                                                   work closely together with both public and private parties. To this end, the Defence  
                                                   organisation is represented in the Cyber Security Council and participates in the NCSC.  

                                                   As manager of high-grade digital networks and systems, the Defence organisation is an  
                                                   important partner with specific knowledge and capabilities. On the basis of the Defence  
                                                   organisation’s third core task, it can make this knowledge and these capabilities available  
                                                   to civil authorities on request. Following a formal request and approval in accordance  
                                                   with the legal basis for assistance or the regulations for providing support, measures can  
                                                   be taken under the authority of the party making the request. The manner in which  
                                                   capabilities are to be made available for cyber operations is being worked out in greater  
                                                   detail. Furthermore, there are grounds to consider whether cyber assets of the Defence  
                                                   organisation can be brought into the interdepartmental administrative agreements  
                                                   concerning specific guaranteed availability of the armed forces as part of the  
                                                   Intensification of Civil-Military Cooperation policy. The capabilities of the Defence  
                                                   organisation will have to contribute to improving the security and reliability of the entire  
                                                   Dutch cyberspace. 

                                                   When organising a comprehensive approach, it is important for roles, tasks and responsi- 
                                                   bilities to be clear. It is essential to be able to bring large-scale digital disruptions under  
                                                   control rapidly and effectively, in joint consultation. In this context, at the initiative of the  
                                                   National Coordinator for Counterterrorism and Security, the current national crisis  
                                                   management structure will be reviewed. The Defence organisation will contribute to this  
                                                   review.  

                                                   Cooperation with public-sector partners, universities and the private sector is also needed  
                                                   in the areas of research and development, training and personnel. Different parties are  
                                                   confronted with the same challenges, such as limited budgets and scarcity of qualified  
                                                   personnel. New possibilities for strategic cooperation must be investigated. The Defence  
                                                   organisation contributes to the National Cyber Security Research Agenda and, as part of  
                                                   the government’s policy regarding the private sector, to the priority status given to cyber  
                                                   security by the high-tech industry. Within the same framework, the Defence organisation  
                                                   will work together closely with other ministries, knowledge institutes and the private  
                                                   sector. With regard to the development of resources and capabilities, alliances will be  
                                                   sought with the private sector.

                                                 At the international level, the Defence organisation seeks cooperation with countries that  
                                                  aspire to a similar level of ambition and approach and operate at a similar level as the  
                                                  Netherlands. The initial purpose of cooperation is the exchange of knowledge. At a later  
                                                  stage, the possibilities for the joint development of assets and techniques and the  
                                                  collective establishment of capabilities will be looked into.  

                                                  For the Netherlands Defence organisation, NATO is the primary partner for cooperation in  
                                                  strengthening cyber defence. In that context, the Defence organisation contributes  
                                                  actively to the development and implementation of NATO policy. As was emphasised  
                                                  during the Chicago summit of May 2012, NATO will improve the protection of its own  
                                                  networks and systems, as well as those of allies that are crucial to the functioning of  
                                                  NATO. The Netherlands also endorses NATO’s ambition to strengthen its members’  
                                                  combined capabilities for intelligence analysis. It is unlikely that collective cyber capabili- 
                                                  ties will be developed under the aegis of NATO. The Alliance will, however, have to  
                                                  develop a vision on the deployment of cyber capabilities in NATO operations.  

                                                  The Defence organisation also supports the EU’s efforts to put in place a comprehensive  
                                                  Internet security strategy. It is important for the Defence organisation that the EU and  
                                                  NATO keep working together intensively to enhance member states’ abilities to defend  
                                                  themselves. To this end, the exchange of information in this field between the two  
                                                  organisations must be increased.

In conclusion 

                                                 The focal points in the strategy set out in this document must ensure that the armed  
                                                 forces will be able to operate effectively and efficiently in cyberspace. By investing in  
                                                 cyber defence and operational capabilities, the Netherlands will be able to maintain  
                                                 high-quality and high-tech armed forces that can be deployed flexibly and perform their  
                                                 tasks in every domain. The House of Representatives will be informed of the progress  
                                                 made in implementing this strategy in the Defence budget and the annual report. In 2016,  
                                                 a policy assessment will be carried out.
