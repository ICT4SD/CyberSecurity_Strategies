Foreword  

The digital domain has been a part of Dutch  society for  
more than two decades. During this period,  information  
and communications technology has proven to be an  
 important factor in productivity growth and  innovative  
power. The Netherlands is the European leader in  
 responding to technological trends and the  effective  
use of ICT tools and skills. The Netherlands is also  
an  international internet hub, has the world’s most  
 competitive internet market and has one of the highest  
number of internet users.  

Safeguarding digital security and freedom and  
 maintaining an open and innovative digital domain are  
preconditions for the proper functioning of our society.  
Therefore, we published the first National Cyber Security  
Strategy (NCSS1) in 2011. The purpose of the NCSS1 was  
to realise a secure, reliable and resilient digital domain  
through an integral cyber security approach based on  
public-private partnerships, as well as to seize the ensuing  
opportunities for society.  
                                                                          Furthermore, extensive consultations were held with the  
Developments in the digital domain, both national and                     wider ICT community. At the request of the government,  
international, are taking place at a rapid rate. In recent                the Cyber Security Board, consisting of representatives  
years, the potential and actual impact of cyber  security                 from public and private parties as well as the world of  
threats have become clearer due to a number of highly                     academia, gave recommendations about the course of the  
 publicised incidents. These threats may not only  disrupt                new strategy.

the integrity, availability and confidentiality of the                    With this strategy, the Netherlands wants to continue

digital domain.                                                            Fortunately, we do not have to start from scratch. The  
                                                                           Netherlands already has a solid digital  infrastructure  
In order to be able to continue to respond to these                       and has many internet pioneers and innovative  
threats, the Netherlands plans to further strengthen                      ICT  entrepreneurs who are active the world over.  
and extend their alliances with public and private                         Furthermore, the Netherlands has a proven talent in  
parties, both national and international. This involves                   building coalitions: not only within its borders, but also  
not viewing cyber security as an isolated element, but                    in the area of international peace and security. Together,  
rather in correlation with human rights, internet freedom,                we can create a secure, free and profitable digital domain.  
privacy, social-economic benefits and innovation. The                     Everyone will have to take responsibility for his or her own  
National Cyber Security Strategy 2 (NCSS2) explains this                  digital resilience and for society’s digital resilience. The  
broader government vision on cyber security and states                    government is taking the lead with this new strategy and  
responsibilities and concrete steps.                                      will publish annual reports about the progress made. 

About 130 parties, including public and private parties,  
knowledge institutions and social organisations, were                     The Minister of Security and Justice 
involved in the drafting of this new cyber security strategy.             I.W. Opstelten

     prevention 
The Netherlands aims to develop a hub for expertise  
on international law and cyber security. The goal of the  
hub for expertise is to promote the peaceful use of the  
digital domain. To this end, the Netherlands combines  
knowledge from existing centres. The centre brings  
together international experts and policymakers,  
diplomats, military personnel and NGOs.

To enlarge the pool of cyber security experts and enhance  
users’ proficiency with cyber security, the business  
community and the government join forces to improve  
the quality and breadth of ICT education at all academic  
levels (primary, secondary and professional education).
