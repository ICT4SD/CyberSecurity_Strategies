NATIONAL 
CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY 


EXECUTIVE SUMMARY 

Bangladesh requires reliable physical and information communication 
technologies (ICTs). The two types of infrastructure jointly support essential 
services in sectors such as communications, emergency services, energy, 
finance, food, government, health, transport and water. Therefore, to achieve our 
economic security and democratic objectives, we require reliable physical and 
digital infrastructure. Physical assets increasingly depend upon the reliable 
functioning of the digital infrastructure or critical information infrastructure (CII) to 
deliver services and to conduct business. Consequently, significant disruption to 
CII could have an immediate and debilitating impact that reaches far beyond the 
ICT sector and affects the ability of a nation to perform its essential missions in 
multiple sectors. Therefore, critical information infrastructure protection (CIIP) is 
everyone’s responsibility. 

This document is “The National Cybersecurity Strategy of Bangladesh”. It is one 
of the long-term measures for protecting our cyber world against security threats, 
risks and challenges to national security. The Strategy addresses the country’s 
national security strategy. The purpose of this document is to create a coherent 
vision for 2021 keeping Bangladesh secure and prosperous by coordinating 
government, private sector, citizens and international cyberspace defense efforts. 

This National Cybersecurity Strategy outlines a framework for organizing and 
prioritizing efforts to manage risks to our cyberspace or critical information 
infrastructure. To achieve the aforesaid goals above, this Strategy significantly 
raises the profile of cybersecurity within our governments and defines clear roles 
and responsibilities. Cognizant of the shared nature of cyber vulnerabilities, this 
Strategy also requires a public-private partnership to fix the potential vulnerability 
of private sector-owned critical infrastructures in banking, utilities and 
telecommunications sectors against cyber attacks.

In addition, we recognize that cybersecurity is a global challenge that demands 
truly international solutions. Therefore, we commit ourselves to joining regional 
and international partnerships creating solutions for addressing the cybersecurity 
challenge regardless of threat. We, therefore, present this Strategy in terms of 
the Pillars of the International Telecommunication Union’s Global Cybersecurity 
Agenda (GCA). The GCA contains five strategic pillars and seven goals for 
building collaboration between relevant parties in the fight against cyber threats. 
We aim to help the GCA become the key framework for creating a secure and 
safe information society. 

STRATEGIC CONTEXT 

Bangladesh needs to build confidence and security in the use of ICTs because of 
the growing sophistication, frequency and gravity of cyber threats. Cyber threats 
are a concern because the disruption or destruction of critical information 
infrastructure could potentially have severe economic, social and national 
security impacts. 

Our cyberspace faces a range of threats. Cyber threats range from espionage 
directed towards obtaining political intelligence to phishing to facilitate credit card 
fraud. In addition to Government information, espionage now targets the 
intellectual property of commercial enterprises in areas such as communication 
technologies, optics, electronics and genetics. The design of the Internet 
infrastructure facilitates some of the cyber threats due to its borderless, 
anonymous and cross-border nature. Yet, the same insecure Internet serves as a 
basis for critical government and private sector services in Bangladesh. 

We attach great value to the protection of all types of cyber threats. Indeed, 
cyberspace is swiftly becoming critical to the control of cyber threat devices 
linked to the energy and transportation sectors such as electronic transformers 
and pipeline pumps. New smart grid technologies deliver intelligent monitoring, 
control, communication and self-healing technologies. However, smart meters 
are susceptible to unauthorized modification, distributed denial of service and 
disruption during patching. We are also concerned about an increasing number 
of cyber attacks. For example, a growing number of cyber attacks aim to steal 
official government documents detailing negotiating positions. Disclosure of such 
details would seriously harm our national security and interests.

AwZwi³, 
gvP© 11, 
2014 


Worryingly, cyber espionage and other cybercrimes are very low cost activities. 
Attack tools and methodologies for activities such as phishing or malware 
distribution are freely available on the Internet even to amateurs. Besides, 
perpetrators face little risk of conviction due to incompatible legal frameworks 
and the lack of organizational structures to aid international cooperation, dialogue 
and coordination in dealing with cyber threats. Silent surveillance enables hostile 
nations to map the structure and defenses around key government and private 
sector infrastructures, plant backdoors, create and test attacks. 

GOAL 

Working collaboratively home and abroad, to manage all major cyber risks that 
affect us directly irrespective of their origin and type, thereby creating a safe, 
secure and resilient critical national information infrastructure for our economy 
and society. 

PURPOSE OF STRATEGY 

This Strategy recognizes the impact of cyber threats, risks and challenges to our 
national values and interests. The Strategy underlines the need for concerted 
effort to counter these fast evolving threats. This fully integrated approach 
leverages the resources of the Government, organizations across all sectors, 
individual private citizens and international partners in mitigating threats to our 
cyberspace. The Strategy defines the organizational structures required to 
address this embryonic risk to our prosperity and national security. 

WAYS – PRIORITIES 

The Strategy is the basis for a coordinated national and globally compatible 
approach to protecting our critical infrastructure against cyber threats. In line with 
the Global Cyber security Agenda (GCA) of ITU, our strategic Areas are: 

• 
The development of a comprehensive set of national cybercrime legislation 
that is regionally and globally applicable and harmonized 

evsjv‡`k †M‡RU, 
AwZwi³, 
gvP© 11, 
2014 
9705 


• 
The implementation of measures to reduce vulnerabilities in software products 
through the deployment of accreditation schemes, protocols and standards; 
• 
The definition of strategies for capacity building mechanisms to raise 
awareness, transfer know-how and boost cyber security on the national policy 
agenda; and 
• 
The development of a unified national multi-stakeholder strategy for 
international cooperation, dialogue and coordination in dealing with cyber 
threats. 
Cyber Security Priorities 

National Cyber security Strategy should have three national priorities: 

• 
Legal Measures; 
• 
Technical and Procedural Measures; and 
• 
Organizational Structures 
The first priority focuses on strategies for the development of cybercrime 
legislation that is harmonized and applicable globally. The second priority deals 
with organizational structures and policies on cybercrime, watch, warning and 
incident response as well as the creation of a generic and universal digital 
identity system. Priority three focuses on a national framework of security 
protocols, standards and software accreditation schemes. 

Priority 1: Legal Measures 

This Priority deals with the enactment of laws to deter and prosecute cybercrime. 
Inevitably, the actions will depend on national conditions and local needs. The 
establishment and modernization of laws, procedures, and policy to prevent, 
deter, respond to, and prosecute cybercrime is an integral component of the 
National Cybersecurity Strategy of Bangladesh. Since cybersecurity is a global 
challenge, the lack of harmonized national and regional cybercrime legislation 
weakens Bangladesh’s internal and worldwide ability to detect, prosecute and 
deter cybercrime. The National Cybersecurity Strategy identifies the actions 
below as necessary for creating suitable cybercrime legal measures: 


9706 
evsjv‡`k †M‡RU, 
AwZwi³, 
gvP© 11, 
2014 


Action 1: Cybercrime Legislation 

This Action involves creation of laws that are interoperable and applicable 
globally. 

Our cybercrime legislation shall be harmonized with global conventions. 
Therefore, we shall align our cybercrime legislation with the ITU Toolkit for 
Cybercrime Legislation. The alignment of our cybercrime legislation with the ITU 
Toolkit for Cybercrime helps international cooperation and addresses 
jurisdictional and evidentiary issues. 

Additionally, internationally harmonized legislation strengthens cybersecurity, as 
it helps our country build capacity for preventing, deterring and prosecuting 
cybercrime. 

The cybercrime law should be evaluated by all ministries and legislative 
committees that might have an interest in it, even if they have nothing to do with 
criminal justice, so that no useful idea is missed. 

The cybercrime law should similarly be evaluated by the local private sector, by 
any local affiliate of the international private sector, by local non-governmental 
organizations, by academics, by unaffiliated interested citizens, by willing foreign 
governments, and anyone else with a recognized interest. 

It is recommended that the text of National Cybercrime law be drafted to comply 
with the provisions of the Convention on Cybercrime (2001) 

Action 2: Government Legal Authority 

This Action aims to ensure that governments have sufficient legal authority to 
secure cyberspace in public interest. 

• 
To create cybersecurity organization structures including the National 
Cybersecurity Council; 
• 
Defines the legal basis for creating a national CIRT, For example, the Act 
defines the powers to shutdown a critical infrastructure if at risk of a cyber 
attack; 

evsjv‡`k †M‡RU, 
AwZwi³, 
gvP© 11, 
2014 
9707 


• 
Provides the basis for promoting cybersecurity skills, training and awareness; 
• 
Defines the legal and operational basis for an integrated and fully coordinated 
public private sector partnership on cybersecurity; 
• 
Fosters innovation in cybersecurity to help develop long-term solutions; and 
• 
Grants the government authority to participate in international cooperation, 
dialogue and coordination activities focuses on cybersecurity such as mutual 
assistance. 
Priority 2: Technical and Procedural Measures 

This Priority addresses the need to create organizational structures at national 
and regional levels to facilitate communication, information exchange and the 
recognition of digital credentials across jurisdictions. The structures would help 
create a generic and universal digital identity system and the necessary 
organizational structures to recognize digital credentials across jurisdictions 
through the following actions:


Action 1: National Cybersecurity Framework 

This Action aims to create a Framework that defines mandatory security 
standards and offers guidance on issues such as risk management, compliance 
and assurance. 

The Bangladesh National Security Framework outlines minimum-security 
measures that stakeholders must abide by to claim compliance with national 
cybersecurity requirements. The Framework contains core security values and 
minimum standards that apply to a wide range of stakeholders. Stakeholders 
select the applicable standards based on their risk profile and information 
protection needs. The stakeholders may use an internal audit or external auditor 
to demonstrate compliance with the minimum-security standards to a central 
organization. However, the Framework does not provide detailed technical 
instructions on specific ICT systems. 

The National Cybersecurity Strategy identifies the following Policy Goals as vital 
components of the National Cybersecurity Framework: 

• 
Governance and Risk Management 

9708 
evsjv‡`k †M‡RU, 
AwZwi³, 
gvP© 11, 
2014 


• 
Information Security and Assurance 
• 
Protective Marking and Asset Management 
• 
Staff Vetting and Clearance 
• 
Physical and Environmental Security 
Action 2: Secure Government Infrastructure 

This Action deals with spreading awareness of relevant risks, preventive 
measures and effective responses to government Departments and Agencies. 

The Government of Bangladesh owns and operates only a minority of critical 
information infrastructure. However, Bangladesh attributes considerable 
importance to the protection of critical information infrastructure. Therefore, the 
Government will lead the cyberspace security. For example, the Government’s 
procurement process will mandate the inclusion of security clauses in service 
contracts to encourage development of secure cyberspace technologies. The 
National Cybersecurity Strategy identifies the following actions as vital for 
securing cyberspace: 

• 
Create and enforce a staff vetting and clearance scheme; 
• 
Create and enforce a formal information or data classification for sensitive 
data; 
• 
Create and enforce a cybersecurity risk management process across 
government ministries and agencies; 
• 
Define and enforce a robust government Authentication Framework; 
• 
Improve security in government outsourcing and procurement through vetting 
of suppliers, incorporation and enforcement of security clauses in contracts; 
• 
Create a vulnerability management process for all government cyber systems; 
• 
Secure government local area networks;

Action 3: Critical Information Infrastructure Protection 

This Action focuses on defining a process for tracking and fixing vulnerabilities; 
improving attack attribution and prevention capabilities. 

Vulnerabilities are weaknesses that allow a threat or attack to break a system’s 
confidentiality, integrity and availability defenses. Most of cyber attacks result 
from poor technical designs or the exploitation of known but unfixed 
vulnerabilities. The impact of the exploitation of vulnerability depends on the 
value and criticality of information. Critical information infrastructures inevitably 
store valuable information. 

The National Cybersecurity Strategy identifies the following major actions and 
initiatives to reduce threats and related vulnerabilities in Bangladesh: 

• 
Create a process for national vulnerability assessments to help understand the 
potential consequences of threats and vulnerabilities; 
• 
Designate important systems as critical information infrastructure and enforce 
an accreditation regime around them. For example, no system will connect to 
critical infrastructure without a penetration test and other assurance activities; 
• 
Enhance law enforcement capabilities in the investigation, prevention and 
prosecution of cybercrimes; 
• 
Require the use of evaluated software products; 
• 
Prioritize national cybersecurity research and development activities; 
• 
Assess and secure emerging systems; and 
• 
Participate in international efforts to improve the security of Internet protocols 
and routing technologies. 
Priority 3: Organisational Structures 

This Priority Area requires the building of organizational structures and strategies 
to help prevent, detect and respond to attacks against critical infrastructure. The 
National Cybersecurity Strategy identifies the actions below as essential for 
creating appropriate national and regional organizational structures and policies 
on cybercrime:

evsjv‡`k †M‡RU, 
AwZwi³, 
gvP© 11, 
2014 


Action 1: Government’s Cybersecurity Role 

Cybersecurity is everyone’s responsibility because countermeasures only work 
well if all relevant stakeholders play their part. The stakeholders include 
government, business, infrastructure owners and users. Collaboration is vital 
because neither government nor the private sector can independently control and 
protect information infrastructure. 

The Government of Bangladesh has overall responsibility for securing the 
infrastructure in public interest. To improve cybersecurity in Bangladesh, it is vital 
that the Government puts in place appropriate national structures to protect its 
own infrastructure and all assets required to deliver essential services to the 
public. The national, regional and globally compatible organizational structures 
aim to protect classified data and networks against cyber attacks. The 
Government is also responsible for communicating national priorities to the 
private sector to help ensure that critical infrastructure under private sector in 
areas such as banking, transport and telecommunications receives sufficient 
protection. 

To address the cybersecurity challenge, the Government of Bangladesh may 
appoint a senior aide as the National Cybersecurity Coordinator. 

The official has the responsibility to establish a cross-government programme to 
address the priority areas of this Strategy. The official provides strategic 
leadership and ensures the coherence of cybersecurity activities across 
government. The role cuts across government agencies and the official reports to 
the National Cybersecurity Council, as and when formed. The Coordinator has 
direct access to the Head of Government as well as sufficient staff and financial 
resources to coordinate inter-gvernment activities at a strategic level. 

Action 2: National Cybersecurity Council 

The National Cybersecurity Council is the focal point for coordinating efforts to 
protect our cyberspace. This multi-Council body unites operational cybersecurity 


evsjv‡`k †M‡RU, 
AwZwi³, 
gvP© 11, 
2014 
9711 


efforts of government institutions and leads collaboration with industry. Public-
private partnership coordination is critical to protecting our critical infrastructure 
because it enhances information sharing and cooperation on cyber threat 
identification, incident response and recovery. The Cybersecurity Strategy 
mandates the Council to perform the roles below: 

• 
Developing a comprehensive national plan for securing critical 
infrastructure and services whether in government or private sector; 
• 
Providing national major incident response capacity in an event of 
significant attacks on critical infrastructure; 
• 
Providing government and private sector organizations strategic advice 
and processes for managing cybersecurity Programmes; 
• 
Providing integrated security advice (combining information, personnel 
and physical) to the government agencies and businesses owning or 
operating critical information infrastructure to reduce its vulnerability to 
cyber and other threats; 
• 
Acting as the National Technical Authority for Information Assurance for 
private sector organizations and government agencies in all aspects of 
cybersecurity; 
• 
Working with other government agencies including intelligence agencies 
to review threat and vulnerability information and distribute advice on the 
countermeasures to regional and local governmental organizations, 
private sector, academia and the general public; 
• 
Engage in international schemes such as the International Multilateral 
Partnership Against Cyber Threats (IMPACT) for alerts, early warning 
and cooperation; 
• 
Perform and fund research and development with other agencies to 
create a new generation of secure cyber technologies. An annual review 
assesses the effectiveness of the Council’s cybersecurity activities.

Action 3: National Incident Management Capacity 

Timely identification, communication and recovery from major cybersecurity 
events and weaknesses affecting critical information infrastructure can often 
mitigate the damage resulting from malicious cyberspace activity. Best practice 
indicates that these efforts are most effective at national level because they 
provide wider participation in analysis, warning, information gathering, 
vulnerability reduction, mitigation and recovery. Inevitably, the government needs 
to work with the private sector to coordinate a national response because private 
firms own the infrastructure and often have better skills. The government creates 
legal and regulatory incentives to encourage critical infrastructure owners and 
operators to ensure that their systems are resilient to attacks. This Strategy 
identifies the following actions regarding cyber incident response: 

• 
Build Bangladesh Computer Incident Response Team (BD-CIRT) at the 
National Cybersecurity Council; 
• 
Establish a public-private framework for responding to major cyber 
incidents; 
• 
Encourage development of business continuity and disaster recovery 
capacity; 
• 
Develop strategic and tactical cyber attack and vulnerability assessment 
capacity; 
• 
Encourage the development of private sector capacity to share status 
information about the health of cyberspace; 
• 
Coordinate processes for voluntary participation in the development of 
national public-private continuity and contingency plans; 
• 
Create a Cyber Warning and Information Network at Cybersecurity Council; 
and 

evsjv‡`k †M‡RU, 
AwZwi³, 
gvP© 11, 
2014 
9713 


• 
Develop mechanism to share information about cyber attacks, threats and 
vulnerabilities with the public and non-governmental bodies locally and 
globally; 
• 
Where possible, it is advisable for units to have at least basic computer 
forensic capacity. Such capacity will require software tools and additional 
training. 
Action 4: Public-Private Partnerships 

The commercial sector owns and operates most of the critical infrastructure that 
Bangladesh relies on home and abroad. Clearly, the Government alone cannot 
secure cyberspace since it does not own or operate the infrastructure. Therefore, 
the Government of Bangladesh should form meaningful partnership with the 
private sector on cybersecurity. The National Cybersecurity Strategy requires the 
Government of Bangladesh and its agents to consult the private sector in the 
development, implementation and maintenance of regulation, cybersecurity 
initiatives and policies. Cooperative relationships with the private sector are vital 
because they: 

• 
Facilitate the exchange of information on the development of new legislation 
and regulation between stakeholders; 
• 
Enable collaborative work and sharing of training courses that could help 
alleviate the severe shortage of skilled cyber security professionals; and 
• 
Enable real time exchange of information about cyber threats and 
vulnerabilities 
The communication channel is valuable for the BD-CIRT as the exchange 
complements the stretched national incident detection and warning resources. 

With private sector input, the Government shall also develop a coordinated 
national strategy for participating in major international discussions that shape 
policy in areas such as territorial jurisdiction, sovereign responsibility and the use 
of cyberspace for war. Additionally, the Cybersecurity Coordinator or an equally 
empowered party works with government departments and agencies, the private 
sector and academia to formulate and coordinate Bangladesh’s international 
cybersecurity positions. Thereafter, the ministries of Foreign Affairs should work 
on improving international cooperation.

AwZwi³, 
gvP© 11, 
2014 


Action 5: Cyber security Skills and Training 

The Action focuses on the creation of programmes to increase the capability of 
cybersecurity professionals in Managerial, Technical and Information Assurance 
areas. 

This Action requires the initiation of a programme to train a cadre of citizens to 
secure information flows. This Action focuses on the training of professionals, not 
creating general awareness. This Cybersecurity Strategy identifies the following 
major activities: 

• 
Adopt a national Cybersecurity Skills Framework; 
• 
Create a continuum of cybersecurity job descriptions; 
• 
Identify commercially available cybersecurity certifications; 
• 
Deliver or manage commercial delivery of training or certification 
examinations; 
• 
Periodically measure Cybersecurity skills and training levels; 
• 
Invest in mainstream cybersecurity education and research; 
• 
Build cybersecurity capacity of national companies; and 
• 
Work with global partners such as IMPACT to coordinate cybersecurity 
training; 
It is important that prosecutors and judges have some understanding of areas 
such as computers, software, and networks as well as of the increasing 
importance of electronic evidence. Similarly, legislators should have some 
understanding of those topics and of whether a country’s laws are adequate to 
address cybercrime. It may also be helpful to train senior policy-makers, 
government officials, about the threats to electronic networks (for example, how 
the national banking system could be attacked) and about the threats posed by 
electronic networks (for example, the use of the Internet to locate vulnerable 
children for sexual trafficking). 


evsjv‡`k †M‡RU, 
AwZwi³, 
gvP© 11,

9715 


Action 6: National Culture of Cybersecurity 

The Action focuses on the need to raise awareness about cyber threats and the 
role all relevant stakeholders must play to secure their part of cyberspace. Many 
cyber threats materialize due to insecure user activities. The users could be end 
users or system administrators. A lack of awareness coupled with a general lack 
of skilled cybersecurity professionals increases the likelihood that attackers 
would trick users into performing insecure activities. On the contrary, user 
awareness helps create a cybersecurity culture that in turn reduces the likelihood 
and impact of cyber attacks. This Cybersecurity Strategy identifies the following 
major activities: 

• 
Promotion of a national awareness programme to empower end users – at 
home or general workforce – to secure their own cyberspace-linked 
systems; 
• 
Implementation of a cybersecurity awareness programme for government 
systems that contain classified data; 
• 
Encouraging cybersecurity culture development in business enterprises; 
• 
Adding cybersecurity awareness to the national education curriculum as a 
way of spreading knowledge to pupils and their relatives; 
• 
Engaging civil society in outreach to children and individual users; 
• 
Promotion of private-sector support for professional cybersecurity 
certifications; 
Nations are increasingly dependent on complex systems and information 
technology. In many cases, information and communications technologies (ICT) 
vital to national and economic security are subject to disruption from a number of 
causes, either originating from within or outside the nation. Leaders in 
government and private industry are increasingly confronted with uncertainty 
about cyber risk and vulnerabilities. This uncertainty stems from the complexity 
and interconnectivity of evolving technology used to support critical systems. To 
ensure security and economic vitality, nations must manage cyber security in 
accordance with their own economic, social, and political considerations.
