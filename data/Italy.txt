FOREWORD

The advent of the Internet marks our time. Cyberspace has increasingly become the domain
through which the citizen’s fundamental liberties of information, expression and association are
fulfilled, the transparency of public policies is pursued and the efficiency of public administrations is
stimulated, growth and innovation are attained. In this global virtual arena, billions of connections
are set everyday across geographical borders, knowledge is shared, and the world as we know it is
redesigned at an unprecedented speed.
The security and the prosperity of any Country increasingly depend on the protection of the ICT
networks that host this ever growing wealth of knowledge and connections, and it is therefore more
and more compelling to ensure in cyberspace the respect of the rights and duties already preserved
in the civil society, in the economic fabric of the society, and in the International Community.
The digital arena is not a space outside of the law, and it is our duty to guarantee that also in
this domain the democratic principles and values in which we believe are uphold and the norms
preserving individual liberties, equality and freedom are safeguarded. Likewise, it is only in an
environment of trust and mutual respect that it will be possible to fully reap the opportunities of
growth offered by digital platforms, and to secure the development of an open, safe and reliable
cyberspace for the benefit of our financial system, our companies and our consumers.
The ever-increasing reliance of modern societies on cyberspace implies that the harm occurring
in case of a disruption of the ICT infrastructure or in the event of attacks carried out throughout
the ICT networks could be dreadful at the least. Threats can stem from any point of the world
wide web, and they often hit the weakest links, such as the most vulnerable individuals and the
least protected computer systems and ICT networks. Appalling crimes are carried out through
the world wide web, such as the exchange of child pornography, and online thefts and frauds can
severely damage individual wealth and valuables, hampering the necessary level of trust within
the digital community. Cybercrime is a plague that can cause the bankruptcy of firms and the
theft of their intellectual property, crippling the wealth of an entire nation. We assist with growing
concern to an increasingly insidious threat that exploits ICT vulnerabilities to stealthily steal the
results of our research and development efforts in the field of new technologies and products. For
a country like Italy, which places innovation at the cornerstone of its growth and competitiveness,

5

National strategic framework for cyberspace security

the potential harm is incalculable. Given the growing degree of sophistication of cyber attacks
and the ever-increasing dependency of our infrastructures on ICT networks, our very national
stability and security are at risk. It is therefore essential to ensure the finest possible protection of
our critical ICT assets from attacks that can potentially have devastating effects, as it would be the
case in the event of cyber attacks impeding or subverting the correct functioning of the national
transport system, or of energy grids, or even of our military Command and Control centers. It is
therefore necessary to develop and uphold an innovative defence posture, one that is able to engage
the private sector and leverage its skills in the protection of the critical ICT that the latter owns and
operates, and that factors the cyber dimension of future conflicts in its strategic doctrine and in the
capability planning process.
Networks interdependence, the intrinsic asymmetry of the cyber threat, and the pervasiveness
of cyberspace in all aspects of everyday life are all features that call for a holistic approach and
the synergic efforts of all involved stakeholders if we are to ensure an adequate level of security
in cyberspace. The ultimate objectives must be to strengthen our collective ability to preempt an
attack, to detect it while it happens, to react to it, to mitigate its effects, to attribute its origin, and
to rapidly restore the original functionality, while at the same time retaining the lessons learned
from the case.
At the international level, Italy is fully engaged in multilateral institutions, first of all within
the EU and NATO, as well as with all our bilateral partners, to promote the endorsement and
respect of a set of rules of behavior in the digital arena that is consistent with our values, and to
facilitate the emergence of a shared approach to cyberspace governance, so that the International
Community as a whole can effectively cope with the challenges laying ahead. At the domestic level,
it is of outmost importance the promotion of a well-coordinated and multi-dimensional approach
in order to provide for the convergence of all Public Administrations efforts toward the achievement
of objectives that are mutually reinforcing with those of the private sector and the academia.
In the current financial and economic tightening, we cannot allow for any duplication of
efforts and we must therefore seek any possible synergy, keeping in mind that the budget allocation
that will be necessary constitute not only a net saving if compared with the possible damage cyber

6

Foreword

attacks can entail, but also an extraordinary opportunity of cultural, social and economic growth.
In line with what is set forth in the Prime Minister’s Decree of the 24th January 2013, the
present National Cybersecurity Strategic Framework highlights the nature and the evolving trends
of the cyber threat as well as of the vulnerabilities to the national ICT networks, it outlines roles
and tasks of public and private stakeholders involved in cybersecurity, and identifies tools and
procedures to enhance the country’s preparedness to confront head-on the new challenges posed by
cyberspace. The attached National Plan identifies a limited set of priorities, and provides specific
objectives and guidelines in order to give concrete implementation to the Strategic Framework.
With these two documents Italy sets out a strategy around which to coordinate all efforts, so
that we can face with confidence the security threats and challenges stemming from cyberspace,
and pursue our national interest where the wealth of nations will more and more prosper.

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

Following the adoption of the Prime
Minister’s “Decree Containing Strategic
Guidelines for the National Cyber
Protection and ICT Security” of the
24th January 2013, the Cybersecurity
Working Group was established on the
3rd of April 2013 under the auspices of
the Committee for the Security of the
Republic, chaired by the Department
for Intelligence and Security (DIS), and
developed this National Cybersecurity
Strategic Framework.
The Cybersecurity Working Group
saw the active participation of all the
Administrations already represented in
the Committee for the Security of the
Republic (Ministries of Foreign Affairs,
Interior, Defence, Justice, Economy
and Finance, Economic Development),
and included the Agency in charge for
the Italian Digital Agenda as well as
the Cybersecurity Unit within the Prime
Minister’s Office.
The point of departure of this National
Cybersecurity Strategic Framework is
an assessment of today’s cyber threat.
The growing importance of services
provided through cyberspace in everyday

life – from simple online payments to
the management of strategic and critical
national infrastructures – implies that also
the cyber threat is becoming more and
more pervasive and subtle, and yet it is still
widely unnoticed and underestimated. In
the first chapter, “The Nature and the
Evolving Trends of the Cyber Threat and
of the Vulnerabilities of the National ICT
Infrastructures”, the major cyber threats
and their actors will be acknowledged –
from cybercrime to cyber espionage and
cyber terrorism, from hacktivism to cyber
sabotage, concluding with cyber warfare
– and a brief taxonomy of the cyber
organizational, procedural and technical
vulnerabilities will be proposed.
Cyberspace is a man-made domain
essentially composed of ICT nodes and
networks, hosting and processing an
ever-increasing wealth of data of strategic
importance for States, firms, and citizens
alike, and for all political, social and
economic decision-makers. The second
chapter, “Tools and Procedures to
Strengthen the National Cyber Defence
Capabilities”, identifies six strategic
guidelines around which to converge,

9

National strategic framework for cyberspace security

with a holistic, coherent and synergic
approach, all national efforts, so as to
enhance the country’s preparedness,
resilience and reaction capabilities. These
guidelines include: the enhancement of
the technical, operational and analytic
expertise of all institutions concerned
with cybersecurity; the strengthening
of the cyber protection of ICT networks

and computer systems supporting our
critical and strategic infrastructure; the
facilitation of public-private partnerships;
the promotion of a Culture of Security
and of cyber hygiene; the improvement
of our skills to effectively contrast online
criminal activities; the full support to
international cooperation initiatives in
the field of cybersecurity.

THE NATURE AND THE EVOLVING TRENDS
OF THE CYBER THREAT AND OF THE
VULNERABILITIES OF THE NATIONAL ICT
INFRASTRUCTURES

Introduction

solutions, even in the most advanced
countries, is not an easy task, and it requires
a broad involvement of the private sector.
The private sector, in fact, has a key role to
play in coming up with possible solutions
to cope with the new challenges and threats
stemming from the cyberspace which for
the most part it owns and operates. The
private sector therefore has the interest and
the duty to agree with the public sector on
mutual expectations and responsibilities
in ensuring the protection of cyberspace.
Cyberspace has become a domain of
strategic importance for the economic,
social and cultural development of nations,
and it is hence critical to balance the right
mix of pubic and private engagement in its
governance and management, taking into
account at the same time the requirements
of national security and public order as well
as the fulfillment of all the individual and
economic liberties involved.
Balancing these often diverging
objectives is a complex endeavor, if one
considers for instance how monitoring
the technical functionality of networks is
essential to allow the fulfillment of the
right to privacy and the integrity of one’s

Definition
With the term cyberspace we refer to the
complex of all interconnected ICT hardware
and software infrastructure, to all data stored
in and transferred through the networks and
all connected users, as well as to all logical
connections however established among
them. It therefore encompasses the Internet
and all communication cables, networks
and connections that support information
and data processing, including all mobile
Internet devices.
A complex challenge
The very same nature of cyberspace
and the related transformation of
contemporary societies brought about by
the digital ecosystem are accountable for
the emergence of unprecedented cultural,
social and political issues, which require a
set of coherent, effective and in many cases
original solutions. As the International
Community is still very much divided with
regard to the principles and values that
apply to the cyber domain, seeking these

communication appliances, or also
how it can be difficult to find the right
balance between the right to privacy and
the fight against criminal activities such
as child pornography, drugs smuggling,
hate incitement or terrorism planning crimes that not only hurt individual and
social liberties, but also undermine the
very existence of an open, democratic
and free Internet.

exercised in and throughout cyberspace,
or against cyberspace and its fundamental
elements. The threat is carried out by means
of cyber attacks, by which we mean more
or less automated actions of individuals
and organizations, both governmental
and non-governmental, aiming at
disrupting, damaging or impeding the
regular functioning of computer systems,
ICT networks or supervisory control
and data acquisition systems and data
processing, or at compromising the
authenticity, the integrity, the availability
or the confidentiality of data residing in
those systems or transiting through the
networks.
The most sophisticated cyber attacks
can be carried out through so called cyberweapons, that is a malicious software (i.e.
malware) designed to damage or alter
an IT system with the aim of causing its
malfunction, or even physical damage.

Objectives
The present National Cybersecurity
Strategic Framework and the related
National Plan, both foreseen by the
Prime Minister’s “Decree Containing
Strategic Guidelines for the National
Cyber Protection and ICT Security” of
the 24th January 2013, aim at enhancing
the national preparedness to respond to
present and future challenges affecting
cyberspace, and are devoted to directing
all national efforts toward common
and agreed solutions, knowing that
cybersecurity is a process rather than an
end to itself, that technical innovations
will always introduce new vulnerabilities
in the strategic and operational horizon,
and that the intrinsic nature of the cyber
threats makes our defence, at least for
the time being, mostly – although not
exclusively–reactive.

An insidious threat
A fundamental characteristic of the
cyber threat is its asymmetric nature. The
attacker:
•	 May strike from anywhere in the
world, as long as he is connected to
the Internet;
•	 Exploits one single vulnerability to hack
into very sophisticated and otherwise
well protected computer systems;
•	 Attacks instantaneously, allowing
no time to mount an appropriate
reaction;
•	 Can hardly be traced or even detected,
making it extremely complex for the
defender to put in place a response.

The cyber threat and its actors
Definition
We define the cyber threat as the
complex of malicious conducts that can be

12

The Nature and the Evolving Trends of the Cyber Threat and of the Vulnerabilities of the National ICT Infrastructures

The intrinsic nature of the cyber
threat, therefore, limits the scope of
deterrence, favors the attack over defence,
and requires that all major stakeholders,
both public and private, implement a
continuous process of analysis so as to be
able to update their security standards and
procedures to the evolving operational
and technical circumstances.

computing, makes cyber attack potentially
very lucrative while being relatively risk-free
for the attacker. It is therefore no surprise
that the economic impact of cybercrime is
quite worrisome. This is especially true for
countries like Italy, for which the theft of
the original scientific, technological and
companies’ know-how is a direct damage
to their existing comparative advantage,
undermining their competitiveness in the
global markets.
Computer crime is a growing concern
also because its illicit profits are often
re-invested in the search of new system’s
vulnerabilities and in the development of
more sophisticated, efficient and easyto-use offensive capabilities, making
cybercrime a threat of primary importance
for the stability, the prosperity and the
security of the country.

Classification of the threat
Depending on the actors involved
and the goals pursued, it is possible to
distinguish four kinds of threats:
•	 Cybercrime: all malicious activities
with a criminal intent carried out
in cyberspace, such as swindles or
internet fraud, identity theft, stealing
of data or of intellectual property;
•	 Cyber espionage: improper acquisition
of confidential or classified data, not
necessarily of economic or commercial
value;
terrorism:
ideologically
•	 Cyber
motivated exploitations of systems’
vulnerabilities with the intent of
influencing a state or an international
organization;
warfare:
activities
and
•	 Cyber
operations carried out in the cyber
domain with the purpose of achieving
an operational advantage of military
significance.

The computer crime market
The computer crime market represents
therefore a very palatable and profitable
sector for autonomous hackers and for
criminal organizations alike. They both
bolster a black market in which it is
possible to trade illegal contents (such as
drugs, child pornography or copyrighted
material) and to sell ready-to-use toolkits
for conducting all kind of attacks and
exploitations to the computer systems
of choice, either independently or
with the technical support of criminal
organizations. This, in turn, multiplies
the opportunities for felonies against
assets (such as swindles, blackmail,
extortions, thefts, etc.), misappropriation
of confidential information and identity

The economic impact of cybercrime

companies’ data and personal assets

data (with the aim, for example, to
demand ransoms or commit other kinds
of violations), recycling of illicit capitals,
gambling and illegal bets. By the same
token, it is more and more evident the
involvement of criminal organizations
in cyber espionage activities, often on
behalf of legitimate companies, with the
objective of stealing industrial patent,
company strategies, market researches,
analysis and description of productive
processes, etc.

The role of the State
Even though the digital arena is a
reality that transcends, from many points
of view, national borders, states are
certainly among the main stakeholders
of cyberspace, because they have the
ultimate responsibility for the protection
of ICT infrastructures on their own
territory, even if they are owned and
operated mostly by the private sector.
States have the human and financial
resources as well as the capability to
organize and manage, overtime, complex

14

The Nature and the Evolving Trends of the Cyber Threat and of the Vulnerabilities of the National ICT Infrastructures

organizations. As such, they are in a
unique position to mount a robust cyber
operational capability.
Protecting the military command
and control networks and ensuring
their full operational capability and
their resilience has always been a top
priority for any State. The advent
of cyberspace, and its key role in
ensuring the functioning of virtually
every national sensitive infrastructure,
industrial process and public services,
has extended the mandate of the State
to the protection of all ICT critical
networks. In fact, the most sophisticated
cyber attacks may not only impair
and paralyze the State’s most vital
communication nodes and the provision
of essential public services, but may also
have potentially destructive effects if
directed against critical infrastructures
such as, for instance, the aviation traffic
management control system or dams
and energy installation’s supervisory
control and management systems,
resulting in great physical damages
and the eventual loss of human life.
The strategic advantage implicit in the
possibility of inflicting a great loss to
the enemy’s critical infrastructures by
striking at great distance makes it very
likely that future military confrontation
will entail the full use of cyberspace. It
is therefore no surprise that nowadays
virtually every nation considers it
relevant in its force planning to foresee
the requirements of a cyber defence
capability that is adequate to protect
national critical ICT infrastructures.

Espionage, sabotage, warfare and supply
chain cyber threat
The defence of cyber networks
requires the development of an effective
and
uninterrupted
capability
of
monitoring and analyzing all ongoing
malicious activities. States are striving
to ensure themselves with this expertise,
either directly or through proxies, and
considering in many cases also the
potential advantages of developing
aggressive tools. It is a well-know fact that
some States already possess the capability
to penetrate public and private networks
of other States, and use this capability
for espionage and in order to map ICT
systems that could be potential targets in
case of future attacks. In such a situation,
is also highly plausible that certain States
may consider mobilizing their national
industry to install through the ICT supply
chain components that could allow for
future stealthy cyber exploitation of the
end-user computer systems and ICT
infrastructure.
Hacktivism
Some cyber attacks are ideologically
motivated and have primarily a
demonstrative intent, like damaging
the image of the target and/or causing
a temporary malfunctioning of the
attacked ICT systems. Examples of this
type of cyber attack are the Distributed
Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks, that,
through coordinated attacks originating
from a number of unaware and remotely
controlled computer (botnets), cause the
intentional overload of servers that host

15

National strategic framework for cyberspace security

specific services. Another example is the
so-called Web Defacement, that alters
the data of a chosen Internet website with
the specific goal to cause disinformation,
defamation or simply mockery. In other
cases, hacktivists make use of malware
quite similar to the ones used by hackers
and computer criminals to surreptitiously
seize data that are owned by the
government, or that belong to companies
or individuals, in order to publically
expose them, or just to demonstrate the
computer skills that they have.

used to perpetrate activities that would
be illegal in other conventional domains.
Terrorism
It is possible that in the next future
terrorist groups or individual “lone
wolves” might make use of cyber offence
capabilities to hit military and civil
targets. These cyber weapons might either
be ready available to terrorists through
criminals operating within the computer
crime market, or might be developed
independently by the terrorists through a
process of reverse engineering of already
existing cyber weapons. Fortunately, this
is for the time being only a hypothetical
threat, but it is essential to make sure that
potentially destructive cyber tools remain
out of the reach of dangerous users.

The use of the Internet for illegal activities
The digital arena is an extraordinary
means to establish connections at the
global level. There is unfortunately
also the risk that this communication
platform and the high level of anonymity
it allows are used by some to spread racial
hate, exchange illegal material (such as,
for example, child pornography) or plan
crimes, civil unrest or terrorist attacks.
Even if we cannot call these phenomena
cyber attacks in the literal sense of
the word, inasmuch as cyberspace in
this case is only used as a means of
communication, there is no doubt
that the inherent lack of attribution
allowed by cyberspace makes the threat
particularly insidious. We cannot
hesitate to clearly assert that the same
norms and rules of behavior that already
exist in the civil society fully apply to
the cyber domain. The challenge before
us is therefore to preserve the greatest
possible degree of freedom of expression
while making sure that the Internet is not

Unexpected event, incident
The full account of threats that stem
from cyberspace is virtually impossible
because this domain is characterized by
continuous technological innovations;
therefore unexpected developments might
confront us with new technological and
governance challenges demanding a
collective and systemic effort. Cyberspace
is a man-made domain, and as such it is
potentially flawed. It is therefore necessary
to develop the necessary skills to anticipate
and prevent rare and unexpected events,
focusing on the resilience and the business
continuity of the services that are essential
for the security and the stability of the
country.

16

The Nature and the Evolving Trends of the Cyber Threat and of the Vulnerabilities of the National ICT Infrastructures

Cyber vulnerabilities

to ensure continuity of the service and to
minimize the impact of natural events on
physical infrastructure.
Technical vulnerabilities are instead
due to the vulnerabilities of hardware and
software, and to faults in communication
protocols. The latter are particularly
worrisome when they affect the Domain
Name System (DNS), because they
impact both ends of the systems, that is
to say the final electronic communication
users as well as the supervisory control
and data acquisition systems of critical
infrastructures connected to the Internet.

Cyber attacks undermine users’ trust
in ICT technologies and impair business
continuity by exploiting organizational,
procedural and technical vulnerabilities
– often in various combinations.
Organizational
and
procedural
vulnerabilities depend both on the
deficient implementation of protection
against malware – such as inappropriate
network design, update of anti-viruses and
anti-spam software – and on the lack of
appropriate physical protection intended

17

National strategic framework for cyberspace security

Such vulnerabilities can cause service
unavailability, or they can compromise
the integrity of the information stored
and provided by the DNS. In both cases,
the exploitation of such vulnerabilities has
extremely serious consequences, possibly
resulting in a grave malfunctioning
of fundamental control nodes of the
infrastructure.
In order to prevent these vulnerabilities
from being exploited, we must first of all
set up a risk assessment, mitigation and
management plan, which must take into
account physical, logic and procedural
cybersecurity measures, and raise
awareness among the personnel through
training and education.
In principle, key requirements of the
cyber security policy should extend to:
•	 Control of the access to physical
installations: in order to minimize the
risk of damage, tampering or theft
of hardware assets, only traceable
and authorized personnel should be

granted access to the installations
warehouse;
•	 Exclusive use of certified products
in order to exclude from the supply
chain foreign retailers considered
“at risk”; use of up-to-date antivirus
software; encryption of data and
digital signature; identification and
authentication of connected users;
monitoring and logging of instances;
updating of the access privileges of
every user (logical measures);
•	 Norms and procedures instructing
all phases and aspects of the security
processes; definition of roles, tasks
and responsibilities within the
risk assessment, mitigation and
management plan; adoption of
specific measures that complete
and reinforce the technological
preparedness; recurring controls on
the consistency and reliability of the
ICT assets (procedural measures).

•	 Identify potential risks; 
•	 Elaborate risk management
policies and procedures.

•	 Establish an effective national
structure for preventing and
managing risk;

The central Role of the Public-Private Partnership (PPP)
As envisaged in the Prime Minister’s
“Decree Containing Strategic Guidelines
for the National Cyber Protection and
ICT Security” of the 24th January 2013,
public and private operators providing
“public networks of communications or
electronic communication services to the
public, operating national and European
critical infrastructures depending on ITC
systems” are among the main stakeholders
of the national architecture to guarantee
cyber protection and national IT security.
According to the aforementioned
Prime Minister’s Decree, such subjects are
obliged to:
•	 Communicate to the Cybersecurity
Unit every significant security and
integrity violation of their own
computer systems;
•	 Adopt all the best practices and
measures necessary to pursue cyber
security;
•	 Share information with the agencies
for intelligence and security and allow
access to databases that are relevant

to cyber security;
•	 Collaborate to the management
of a cyber crisis by restoring the
functionality of the networks and
systems they operate.
The
public-private
partnerships
therefore an essential component
for ensuring the success of any cyber
security strategy. In modern economic
and institutional systems the majority
of essential public services and national
strategic infrastructures are managed by
the private sector. The cooperation with
these actors has been ensured through
ad hoc agreements with the aim to
substantiate even further the cooperation
in this context. In light of further progress,
to be pursued through an incremental
process, the synergies with the private
sector should be extended so as to
include all entities that, independently
of their size, are of strategic value for the
scientific, technological, industrial and
economic progress of the country.

26

ANNEX 1
PUBLIC STAKEHOLDERS’ ROLES AND
MANDATES

The Prime Minister’s Decree of
the 24th January 2013 outlined the
institutional architecture devoted to cyber
protection and ICT security, one in which
the various stakeholders involved, both
from the private and the public sectors,
act in an integrated and consistent way so
as to mitigate cyberspace vulnerabilities,
identify threats, prevent risks and enhance
the national capability to counter crisis
situations.
At the top of such architecture is
the Prime Minister, who adopts the
present National Cybersecurity Strategic
Framework and the National Plan, and
who ensures its practical implementation
through the adoption of specific
directives. The Prime Minister is supported
in this endeavor by the Committee for the
Security of the Republic (CISR), which
may propose the adoption of legislative
initiatives, approves the guidelines to
foster public-private partnerships, the
policies for enhancing info-sharing
arrangements and the endorsement
of best practices, and approves other
measures to strengthen cybersecurity. The
Committee for the Security of the Republic

at Working Level (the so called “Technical
CISR”) is in charge of the verification of
the timely and correct implementation of
the National Plan for cybersecurity, which
complements the National Cybersecurity
Strategic Framework.
Supporting the political level is the
national intelligence community, that
gathers intelligence, produces all-source
analysis, evaluations and forecasts
about the cyber threat, contributes
to the promotion of cybersecurity
awareness and education, and provides
relevant information and alerts to the
Cybersecurity Unit and to other public
and private stakeholders.
The Cybersecurity Unit is established
within the Prime Minister Military
Advisor’s Office with the mandate of
coordinating the various institutions
that compose the national cybersecurity
architecture, preventing and preparing
for situations of crisis, and for early
warning. Notwithstanding the primary
responsibility of each Administration for
the ownership, custody, protection and
data processing of their database and
digital archives, the Cybersecurity Unit:

•	 Evaluates and promotes procedures
for ensuring info-sharing and early
warning alerts for crisis management;

Unit receives warnings of cybersecurity
incident and disseminates the relative
alarms. In the event of an incident of a
magnitude, intensity or nature such that
it is considered of national security relevance, or it cannot be dealt with by the individual concerned Administrations and
it therefore requires a coordinated interministerial response, the Cybersecurity
Unit declares the so-called “situation of

national cyber crisis”, and activates the
Inter-ministerial Situation and Planning
Unit in its “Inter-ministerial Cyber Crisis
Unit” composition. This ensures that all
stakeholders’ response and stabilization
activities are coordinated, and ensures
the full support of the national Computer
Emergency Response Team (CERT) set
within the purview of the Ministry of
Economic Development.
