Executive Summary  
  
Global ICT policies have become more mainstream in the last decade underpinning growth, jobs,  
increasing  productivity,  enhancing  the  delivery  of  public  and  private  services,  and  achieving  
broad socio-economic objectives in the areas of healthcare, education, climate change, energy,  
employment  and  social  development.  As  such,  the  global  ICT  industry  is  fast  changing  as  a  
result of emerging technologies, economic, social and business trends. As ICT applications and  
services  are  becoming  ubiquitous,  they  are  increasingly  essential  for  ensuring  sustainable  
economic development, and Rwanda is no exception.     
  
Adopted  in  2000,  Vision  2020  aims  to  transform  Rwanda  into  a  middle-income  country  and  
transition  her  agrarian  economy  to  an  information-rich,  knowledge-based  one  by  2020.  The  
Government   of   Rwanda   (GoR)   strongly   believes   that   Information   and   Communication  
Technology  (ICT)  can  enable  Rwanda  leap-frog  the  key  stages  of  industrialization.    As  such,  
GoR  has  integrated  ICTs,  through  the  NICI  process,  as  a  key  driver  for  socio-economic  
development to  fast track  Rwanda’s  economic  transformation, and consistently  strives to align  
the country’s development agenda to global trends in order to be competitive.  
  
Since 2000  GoR has  established institutions and mechanisms to create an enabling environment  
for ICT development, deployed critical world-class infrastructure and is continuously developing  
a  skilled  human  resource  base  in  its  quest  to  become  a  knowledge-based  society  and  regional  
ICT hub.   Today, the existence of a conducing legal and regulatory framework, availability of  
good infrastructure and a growing and innovative human resource base are further positioning  
Rwanda as a regional ICT hub.  NICI III aims  to accelerate “services development” by running  
efficient  government  services  and  increasing  private  sector  productivity  and  in  turn  Rwanda’s  
competitiveness.    
  
Rwanda  strives  to  leverage  ICTs  in  all  sectors  of  the  economy  and  is  registering  tremendous  
progress.    In  2010,  Rwanda  was  the  top  global  reformer  in  the  World  Bank  Doing  Business  
                                                                                                                          th 
report  and second global reformer out of 183 countries  in 2011. Rwanda is also the 9    easiest  
place  to  start  a  business  in  the  world  and  the  6th  most  competitive  economy  in  Sub-Saharan  

Africa  according  to  the  20 10  World  Economic  Forum  global  competitiveness  report.  This  has  
largely been a result of several reforms including online business registration, aimed at making  
the business environment more conducive.  Rwanda’s real GDP growth increased from 2.2% in  
2003 to 7.2% in 2010 with a peak growth of 11.5% in 2008, and an overall average GDP of 7%.  
These achievements  are a result of the long-term economic development plan, Vision 2020, its  
medium-term  strategy,  the  Economic  Development  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (EDPRS),  and  
the NICI Plan, which all give a clear direction on how Rwanda will transition from poverty to a  
middle-income, knowledge-based economy.   
  
The  NICI  process,  which  coincides  with  Vision  2020,  begun  with  the  first  of  four  five-year  
rolling  plans,  NICI  I  (NICI-2005  Plan),  that  focused  on  creating  the  necessary  enabling  
environment that would enable the establishment and growth of Rwanda’s ICT sector.  Emphasis  
was  placed   on  establishing  the  appropriate   institutional,  legal   and  regulatory  framework,  
liberalization of the telecoms market, and reduction of entry barriers to the telecom market as  
well as an effective implementation and coordination mechanism.

The just  concluded  second  plan,  NICI  II  (NICI-2010  Plan),  focused  on  providing  world-class  
communications   infrastructure   that   will   serve   as   the   backbone                            for    current   and   future  
communications   requirements.   Today,   Rwanda   enjoys   increased   nationwide   coverage   of  
telecommunication  networks,  has  deployed  a  versatile  and  high  capacity  national  optic  fiber  
backbone  network,  and  a  national  data  center.    Rwanda  is  now  well  positioned  to  become  a  
regional ICT hub that can offer a wide range of competitive ICT products and services.((( 
  
The  third  plan,  NICI  III  (NICI-2015  Plan),  will  focus  on  the  development  of  services  by  
leveraging ICTs to  improve service delivery to citizens, as Rwanda approaches the fourth and  
final phase of the NICI process that will propel Rwanda to achieve Vision 2020 goals.  Lessons  
learned  (Appendix  1)  during  NICI  II  implementation  have  been  widely  considered  in  the  
development of NICIII.   In this phase, emphasis will be placed on the development of services  
in the following five focus areas:  
  
          Skills development aims to develop a high quality skill and knowledge base leveraging  
           ICT  
          Private Sector Development aims to develop a vibrant, competitive, and innovative ICT  
           sector/ ICT enabled private sector  
          Community Development aims to empower and transform communities through  
           improved access to information and services  
          E-Government (e-GOV) aims to improve government operational efficiency and service  
           delivery  
          Cyber Security (CS) aims to secure Rwanda’s cyberspace and information assets  
             
These focus areas will accelerate services development and fuel continued growth.

background   of   Rwanda’s   current   ICT   status   in   relation   to   the   global   context:   national  
development strategies, ICT vision, achievements, challenges and opportunities.  
  
Part 2 highlights the methodology employed in NICI III formulation and provides the rationale,  
description, mission and objectives for each of the five focus areas.  
  
Part 3  elaborates each NICI III project by outlining its purpose, description,  activities, expected  
outcomes  and  outcome  indicators.    The  projects  defined  will  be  implemented  in  the  first  two  
years of the NICI III plan (FY 2011 and FY 2012).   
   
Part 4 describes the institutional and implementation framework for NICI III, including specific  
roles and responsibilities,  and the framework that will guide the development of projects in the  
second phase of NICI III i.e. FY2013 - 2015.   
  
Part 5 is the conclusion.  
  
Implementation  of  NICI  III  projects  will  commence  in  July  2011  and  have  annual/biennial  
project  cycles. NICI II evaluation revealed that  lack of  ownership,  inadequate project planning  
and coordination, and monitoring and  evaluation were major shortcomings.   As such, NICI III

alignment  with  overall  NICI  III  goals.    Annual/biennial  project  cycles  will  allow  for  easy  
adaptation  to  socio-economic  changes  and  emerging  technologies.    A  strong  institutional  and  
implementation framework has been created for NICI III and will require full participation of all  
stakeholders as they each have complementary roles.  Stakeholders include:  
  
           National ICT  Steering Committee, chaired by MINICT,  will provide strategic direction  
            for  Rwanda’s  ICT  sector  and  be  the  guardian  of  NICI  III  implementation,  providing  
            leadership and oversight.   
              
           RDB, the designated coordination and implementing  agency of all GoR  ICT initiatives,  
            in  partnership  with  project   implementers  and  the  private  sector,  will   continue  to  
            implement and oversee the implementation of the NICI III initiatives.  Further, the focus  
            area working groups (FWGs) that we were very instrumental in the NICI III formulation  
            process will continue to support RDB ensuring effective project implementation.  
  
           Project  Implementer  will  be  executing  specific  NICI  III  projects  in  partnership  with  
            RDB.  
  
           On-going  monitoring  and  periodic  external  evaluation  will  objectively  verify  project  
            implementation and overall NICI III progress.  

The  next  five  years  will  be  most  critical  to  Rwanda’s  transformation  into  a  knowledge-based  
economy  as  NICI  III  aims  to  accelerate  services  development  and  advance  the  country’s  
development agenda.

PART 1: PREAMBLE  
This section sets out the overview of the NICI process since its inception in 2000. It also provides  
a  background  of  Rwanda’s  current  ICT  status  in  relation  to  the  global  context  and  national  
development  strategies.  It  also  highlights  Rwanda’s  ICT  vision,  achievements,  challenges  and  
opportunities.  
  
  
1.1.        The Current Context  
  
Global ICT policies have become more mainstream in the last decade underpinning growth, jobs,  
increasing  productivity,  enhancing  the  delivery  of  public  and  private  services,  and  achieving  
broad socio-economic objectives in the areas of healthcare, education, climate change, energy,  
employment  and  social  development.  As  such,  the  global  ICT  industry  is  fast  changing  as  a  
result of emerging technologies, economic, social and business trends. As ICT applications and  
services  are  becoming  ubiquitous,  they  are  increasingly  essential  for  ensuring  sustainable  
economic development, and Rwanda is no exception.     
  
Investing in ICT is a key driver of economic development for emerging and developed markets  
alike. Figure 1 illustrates the correlation between ICT readiness – the availability of broadband,  
computers, and software in a country –  and competitiveness. Countries with the most advanced  
ICT  sectors  present  the  highest  levels  of  competitiveness,  suggesting  that  having  a  country  
                                                                                                                        1 
enabled by ICT improves its overall economic performance in the long run.

Since 2000  GoR has  established institutions and mechanisms to create an enabling environment  
for ICT development, deployed critical world-class infrastructure and is continuously developing  
a  skilled  human  resource  base  in  its  quest  to  become  a  knowledge-based  society  and  regional  
ICT hub.   Today, the existence of a conducing legal and regulatory framework, availability of  
good infrastructure and a growing and innovative human resource base are further positioning  
Rwanda as a regional ICT hub.  NICI III aims  to accelerate “services development” by running  
efficient  government  services  and  increasing  private  sector  productivity  and  in  turn  Rwanda’s  
competitiveness.    
  
Rwanda  strives  to  leverage  ICTs  in  all  sectors  of  the  economy  and  is  registering  tremendous  
progress.    In  2010,  Rwanda  was  the  top  global  reformer  in  the  World  Bank  Doing  Business  
                                                                                                                           th 
report  and second global reformer out of 183 countries  in 2011. Rwanda is also the 9    easiest  
place  to  start  a  business  in  the  world  and  the  6th  most  competitive  economy  in  Sub-Saharan  

Africa  according  to  the  20 10  World  Economic  Forum  global  competitiveness  report.  This  has  
largely been a result of several reforms including online business registration, aimed at making  
the business environment more conducive.  Rwanda’s real GDP growth increased from 2.2% in  
2003 to 7.2% in 2010 with a peak growth of 11.5% in 2008, and an overall average GDP of 7%.  
These achievements  are a result of the long-term economic development plan, Vision 2020, its  
medium-term  strategy,  the  Economic  Development  Poverty  Reduction  Strategy  (EDPRS),  and  
the NICI Plan, which all give a clear direction on how Rwanda will transition from poverty to a  
middle-income, knowledge-based economy.   
  
                                                                                                                   st 
In 2007, Rwanda took a key  step toward its long-term goal when it became the  1  East African  
country  and the 3rd  in Africa to adopt the “One Laptop Per Child” program. This initiative aims  

to  provide  pupils  with  laptops  in  order  to  bridge  the  global  digital  divide.    With  the  above- 
mentioned  achievements  among  many  more,  Rwanda  is  now  on  track  to  achieving  MDG  and  
Vision 2020 goals.   

1.1.1.   ICT Trends  
( 
Internet: In just a few decades, Internet is transforming the way we live, work, socialize and the  
way countries develop and grow.  Its impact on economic wealth  includes the creation of jobs,  
improved  standards  of  living,  and  contribution  to  real  growth.  The  United  Nations  in  its  
Millennium Development Goals  (MDGs)  lists Internet penetration as a key metric in efforts to  
reduce  poverty  and  encourage  rational  development.  According  to  a  2011  McKinsey  report,  
more than 2 billion people now use Internet in every country, in every sector, in most companies,  
and almost $8 trillion exchange hands each year though e-commerce and these numbers are still  
growing. 3   E-commerce              websites      such     as    Amazon,        iTunes,      and     Google       Checkout        are  

transforming global business transactions.     
  
Voice  communication  over  the  Internet  (VoIP),  blogging,  Internet  radio,  Internet  television,  
social   networking   sites,   cloud   computing,   and   Internet-based   user   applications   are   all  
contributing immensely  to the rise in popularity and acceptance of the Internet as the primary  
                                                 4 
communication  method  for  many.  In  2008,  an  estimated  300  Cybercafés  were  operational  of  
which   65%  were   within   Kigali.   However,   due   to   computer   affordability,   mobile   phone  
penetration  and easy connectivity to Internet (Hotspots, 3G modems), that number  decreased to

131  in  2010.  In  2010,  40  Broadband  VSAT  companies  were  operational  in  Rwanda.  It  is  
envisaged  that  the  use  of  VSAT  will  be  drastically  reduced  due  to  increasingly  affordable  
Internet resulting from the deployment of  broadband  through the national  fiber optic backbone  
that been rolled out in the country (over 2,300 km).  In 2010, Internet penetration in Rwanda was  
5.3% compared to the African average of 10.9%. From 2008 to 2010, Rwanda registered one of  
the  highest  Internet  user  growth  rates  with  8900%  compared  to  the  continent  growth  rate  of  
2450%  and  the  world  average  rate  of  444%.  In  2010,  more  than  38.9%  of  Rwanda’s  public  
sector  (ministries,  agencies,  provinces  and  districts)  and  34.5%  of  the  private  sector  had  web  
             5 
presence.   
  
Mobile Applications: There is increased demand linking mobile payment systems with online- 
based e-commerce and trading platforms globally. Today, there are more than 3.4 million mobile  
subscribers  in  Rwanda  who  are  now  able  to  purchase  electricity  and  airtime  anywhere  at  any  
time  as  a  result  of  mobile  payment  systems.    Rwandan  software  developers  and  telecom  
providers can work together to capitalize on this trend.   
       
Outsourcing: Outsourcing of help-desk services, desktop management, data-center services, and  
on-the-spot  support  services  are  on  the  rise.  It  is  creating  new  job  opportunities  in  the  IT  
industry,  stimulating  the  need  for  progressive  and  innovative  strategies  to  connect  employees  
from continent to continent.    Nelson Hall, a global outsourcing research firm, estimates global  
demand  for  business  processing  outsourcing  (BPO)  services  at  $250  billion  annually  and  it  is  
projected to increase to $750 billion by 2020. Demand for BPO services in Rwanda is estimated  
at  $50  million,  which  will  increase  to  almost  $200  million  by  2020  with  regional  market  
                                                                  6 
potential predicted to be $1900 million in 2020.     
  
Information  Security:  Information  security  is  increasingly  becoming  of  critical  importance  
given  the  need  to  secure  critical  information  currently  available  online.  This  is  a  result  of  
advanced  and  repeated  cyber-attacks  to  government  and  private  companies  that  are  now  
                                                                                                                     7 
spending  more  on  security  technology,  assessments,  training,  and  certification.  Rwanda  is  
investing,  and must continue to do so, in IT and information security to ensure that Rwandan’s  
information is not compromised.     
  
Cloud Computing: There is a shift in the global service model in which service providers are  
leveraging cloud computing  technologies to offer “everything-as-a-service”. This is a new and  
swiftly growing approach to service provision.  Gartner, a leading cloud computing research firm  
estimates that the global market for cloud computing will reach  $148 Billion by 2014.  Today,  
Rwanda has constructed a national data center that is fully capable of maximizing the potential in  
cloud computing, paving the way for increased services development.   
  
Green ICT: A host of trends, including rising stakeholder awareness, increasing environmental  
regulations  and  rising  energy  costs  are  causing  many  executives  to  “green”  their  companies.  
Through  reduction  in  CO2  emissions,  the  IT  industry  can  save  billions  of  dollars  and  garner  
more money in electric utilities rebates. Benefits and incentives are being offered to businesses  
in  countries  like  the  United  States  as  reducing  carbon  emissions  has  become  a  pressing  issue.   
Governments  in  countries  like  Canada  and  South  Africa  are  refurbishing  ICT  equipment.   
Refurbished  computers  are  then  distributed  across  these  countries  to  schools,  libraries  and

registered non-profit learning organizations.  Rwanda can greatly increase ICT penetration and  
utilization through such initiatives.     
  
Convergence: Technological innovation and market demand are driving the ICT sector toward  
convergence.  This  trend  is  lowering  barriers-to-entry;  allowing  service  providers  to  try  new  
business  models;  promoting  competition;  reducing  costs  for  service  providers  and  users,  and  
broadening the range of services and technologies available to users. The growing use of Internet  
protocol (IP)-based packet-switched data transmissions has made it possible for various devices  
and  applications  to  use  any  one  of  several  networks,  and  interconnect  previously  separated  
networks. Service providers around the world are embracing convergence through investment in  
all-IP  networks  –  estimated  to  reach  a  cumulative  total  of  $200  billion  in  2015  –  and  in  
                                          8 
converged  business  models.  Rwandan  telecom  companies  are  also  following  this  trend  by  
converging voice and data network infrastructure.    
  
In order to  compete in an increasingly globalized market place, developing economies need to  
not  only  use  ICT,  but  also  ensure  the  availability  of  ICT  to  all  sectors  of  the  economy.  This  
requires a significant investment in infrastructure, capacity building, and a policy environment  
that fosters innovation and growth.  Rwanda, through the NICI process, has  created an  enabling  
environment and deployed critical infrastructure for ICT growth and development.  NICI III aims  
to  capitalize  on  this  to  accelerate  services  development  through  ICT  by  running  efficient  
government  services  and  improving  business  efficiency  and  productivity,  thereby  facilitating  
sustainable economic competitiveness for Rwanda.   
  
1.2.       Vision  
  
Adopted in 2000, Vision 2020 provides a set of overarching goals that aim to transform Rwanda  
from an agrarian to knowledge-based economy and achieve middle-income  status by 2020.  It is  
the blueprint for the country’s economic development strategies that has the following six pillars  
and three crosscutting areas:    
  
      1.   Good governance and a capable state  
     2.   Human resource development and a knowledge based economy   
     3.   A private sector-led development                        
     4.   Productive and market oriented agriculture  
      5.   Infrastructure development  
      6.   Regional and international economic integration and cooperation  
  
Crosscutting areas:  
      1.   Gender equality  
     2.   Protection of environment and sustainable natural resource management  
     3.   Science and technology, including ICT  
  
GoR  has adopted the following strategies to  fast track the achievement of Vision  2020 in three  
priority clusters including economic, social and governance.

Economic Development & Poverty Reduction Strategy 2008-2012  (EDPRS)  is the medium- 
term  framework  for  achieving  Vision2020.  It  follows  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDG)  
benchmarks and targets, organised in 3 flagship programmes:  
            
1) Sustainable growth for jobs and exports  
2) Vision 2020  Umurenge – a pro-poor, rural development programme for poverty reduction   
3) Governance  
  
Vision  2020  Umurenge  is  a  highly  decentralised  integrated  rural  development  programme  
designed to accelerate extreme poverty reduction in Rwanda. It is currently being piloted in 30 of  
the poorest sectors, “imirenge” around the country.   
  
The  Governance  Programme  underpins two  flagship programmes that provide an anchor for  
pro-poor  growth  by  building  on  Rwanda’s  reputation  as  a  country  with  a  low  incidence  of  
corruption and a regional comparative advantage in “soft infrastructure”. The capacity of local  
government and accountability  are  strengthened, and a business-friendly, risk-free environment  
              9 
promoted.   
  
The most recent  Government 7-year plan (2010-2017)  focuses on private sector development  
and job creation; good governance and zero-tolerance of corruption; economic growth combined  
with  poverty  reduction;  capacity  building  in  all  sectors,  and  transformation  of  the  agriculture  
sector – especially increasing the use of technology and thus productivity.  
  
In line with Vision 2020, GoR  integrated ICT as a key driver for socio-economic development  
by  adopting  the  Rwanda  ICT  for  Development  (ICT4D)  policy,  commonly  known  as  the  
National  Information  and  Communication  Infrastructure  Plan  (NICI) .    The  NICI  plan,  which  
started in 2001, aims at fast tracking Rwanda’s transformation to a knowledge-based society. Its  
objectives are to:   

     •    Transform Rwanda into an IT-literate nation   
     •    Promote and encourage the deployment and utilization of ICTs within the society  
     •    Improve the civil and public service efficiency   
     •    Develop the information and communications infrastructure of Rwanda  
     •    Make Rwanda a regional ICT hub   
     •    Transform  the  educational  system  using  ICTs  with  the  aim  of  improving  accessibility,  
          quality and relevance to the developmental needs of Rwanda  
     •    Empower  Rwandans  by  developing  a  human  resource  base  that  adapts  to  changing  
          demands of the economy  
     •    Develop  the  legal,  institutional  and  regulatory  framework  and  structures  required  to  
           support the deployment and utilization of ICT  
  
These objectives have been the guiding principles of the NICI process to-date.

In  order  to  transform  Rwanda  into  a  knowledge-based  economy,  GoR  integrated  ICT  in  the

stages of industrialization and transform her agro-based economy into a service, information-rich  
and  knowledge-based   one  that  is  globally  competitive.    In  1998,  the  Rwandan  ICT  for  
Development (ICT4D) policy was adopted  to implement policies and plans  that would address  
Rwanda’s   developmental   challenges   in   the   information   and   technology   age,   in   order   to  
accelerate  the  country’s  socio-economic  development.  In  2000  GoR  begun  implementing  the  
ICT4D policy, commonly known as NICI, and subsequently developed and implemented NICI I  
(NICI-2005 Plan), the first of the four five-year rolling plans. Emphasis in NICI I was placed on  
creating   a   conducing   environment   by   establishing   the   institutional,   legal   and   regulatory  
framework for ICT development, putting in place the necessary mechanisms, liberalization of the  
telecoms  market,  reduction  of  entry  barriers  to  the  telecom  market  as  well  as  an  effective  
implementation and coordination mechanism.  
  
The  just  concluded  second  plan  NICI  II  (NICI-2010  Plan)  focused  on  providing  world-class  
communications           infrastructure       as   a    backbone       for    current     and     future    communications  
requirements.         Several       projects       ranging       from       increased        nationwide        coverage         of  
telecommunications   networks,   versatile   and   high   capacity   national   optic   fiber   backbone  
network,  national  data  center  as  well  as  a  centralized  monitoring  and  operations  center  were  
among the accomplishments of NICI II.    
  
The  third  plan  NICI  III  (NICI-2015  Plan)  will  build  on  the  two  previous  phases  and  propel  
Rwanda to the fourth and final phase of the NICI process. In this phase, emphasis will be placed  
on services development across five focus areas identified to fuel continued growth.  This plan is  
more flexible than previous ones  in that it  allows  for easy adaptation to emerging technologies  
and     sectoral      changes.       This     approach       ensures       coherence        and     continuity      throughout  
implementation  of  NICI  III.  As  such,  projects  will  be  implemented  annually  or  biennially  
compared to the previous plans in which projects had 5-year life cycles to ensure easy adaptation  
to emerging technologies and changing national priorities.    
  
Figure 2  below illustrates the NICI process to date. NICI I and II  provided the foundation for  
Rwanda’s ICT development. The third level illustrates the NICI III framework, which focuses  
on five key areas defined as focus areas. The fourth level denotes the fourth plan NICI IV (NICI- 
2020   Plan),  which   will   complete   the   NICI   process   by   consolidating   the   country’s   ICT  
transformation.

1.4.     ICT Achievements  
  
Since the beginning of NICI process, Rwanda has made significant progress towards becoming a  
knowledge-based economy and  is now well positioned to become a regional ICT hub that can  
offer a wide range of competitive ICT products and services.((  The following achievements have  
been registered in the country’s priority clusters i.e. economic, social and governance:    
  
Economy  
Private  sector :  ICT  initiatives  fostering  Rwanda’s  private  sector  development  include  several  
business  and  career  development  support  services;  online  trade  information  portals;  business  
incubators;     online    tax   calculators;    credit   reference     bureau;    a   land   administration      and  
management  information  system;  electronic  case  management  system;  and  improvements  in  
online  banking  and  e-transaction  regulatory  system.  These  initiatives  have  greatly  improved  
Rwanda’s  business  environment.  In  2010,  Rwanda  was  the  top  global  reformer  in  the  World  
Bank’s “Ease of doing business” ranking, moving up from 143rd in 2009 to 67th, the biggest jump  

ever  recorded  by  any  country.  Online  business  registration  was  key  to  Rwanda’s  improved  
ranking in 2011, where it currently ranks 58th .  

  
Agriculture :     ICT    initiatives   benefiting     the   agriculture     sector   include    the    Agricultural  
Management  Information  System  (AMIS);  an  online  exchange  platform,  “e-Soko”,  a  mobile  
market information solution that allows farmers and consumers to access market information for

Government  Award  (TIGA).  A  Land  Use  Management  and  Information  System  has  been  
implemented to ensure proper usage, planning and management of land.   
  
ICT :   Rwanda   has   registered   significant   progress   in   the   deployment   of   world-class   ICT  
infrastructure  that  is  now  connecting  Rwandans  to  global  networks.    The  national  fiber  optic  
backbone network that is connecting Rwanda to international sea cables will facilitate increased  
affordability  and  access  to  Internet  across  the  country.  A  national  data  centre  has  been  
developed,  which  allows  Rwanda  to  centralize  her  information  storage,  management  and  
protection,  as  well   as  take  advantage  of  cloud  computing  opportunities.  Communication,  
Navigation  Surveillance  and  Air  traffic  management  system  (CNS-ATM)  has  been  deployed,  
which   will   greatly   transform   air   travel,   not   just   for   Rwanda,   but   the   region   at   large.   
Broadcasting  masts  that  are  transforming  broadcasting  nationally  have  been  deployed  at  
Rwanda’s highest peak thereby fast tracking Rwanda’s migration from analogue to digital.  Key  
achievements in this sector include:  
  
      •   Enactment of telecom law No. 44/2001 of 30/11/2001 as well as the Law No. 39/2001 of

Social  
Education :  GoR has implemented numerous ICT in education initiatives including ICT training  
for  teachers  and  One  Laptop  Per  Child  that  are  transforming  the  delivery  and  quality  of  
education; Science and Technology scholarships that are growing the number of ICT capacity;  
Schoolnet  that  aims  to  improve  connectivity  and  deploy  ICT  tools  in  12-year  basic  education  
schools; RwEdNet that is interconnecting Rwanda’s institutions of higher learning and linking  
them to global  education and research networks,  and  the Rwanda Education Commons  a one- 
stop  portal  for  education  information.    These  initiatives  are  transforming  and  improving  the  
delivery and quality of education in Rwanda.   
  
Health :  Numerous  ICT  initiatives  have  been  implemented  in  health  such  as:  OpenMRS  –  an  
open-source medical records system that facilitates nationwide tracking of patient data;  TRACnet  
–  a  system  that  allows  central  collection  and  storage  of  clinical  health  information;  Mobile  e- 
Health  –  a  system  used  by  community  health  workers  to  collect  data  for  OpenMRS  and  
TRACnet  systems;  Telemedicine  –  that  is  connecting  King  Faisal  Hospital  to  Hospitals  in  
Kabgayi  and  Musanze  facilitating  the  sharing  of  clinical  information  between  urban  and  rural  
hospitals,  and  most  importantly  allowing  citizens  to  receive  specialized  treatment  services  
remotely without travelling to Kigali.  These initiatives are transforming healthcare delivery and  
helping  Rwanda  achieve  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  in  health,  which  is  earning  
Rwanda critical acclaim world-wide.    
  
Governance  
E-Government: Numerous e-Government initiatives such as the modern and secure National ID  
and  driving  license;  e-Cabinet;  e-Parliament,  document  tracking  and  workflow  management  
system; financial management system (FMS) and human resource management system (HRMS)  
have been or are in the process of being deployed to improve government operations and service  
delivery  to  citizens.    One  of  the  key  tools  introduced  by  the  GoR  in  2006  to  reinforce  
participation  and  accountability  of  local  government  is  performance-based  contracts,  locally  
referred  to  as  “Imihigo”.  Imihigo  is  an  old  cultural  practice  of  Rwanda  where  an  individual  
would  set  him/herself  targets  to  be  achieved  within  a  specific  period  of  time.  Through  this  
approach, local governments and communities set their own priorities and strategies to achieve  
their goals.  Furthermore, hundreds of local government officials and citizens have been trained  
in ICTs to promote ICT literacy and citizen participation in the country’s development.   These  
initiatives will most certainly improve government-to-citizen (G2C) services and facilitate more  
development in the governance cluster.   
            
1.5.      Challenges and Opportunities  
       
The  principle  that  guides  this  strategy  is  that  Rwanda  should  not  only  be  a  consumer  of  ICT  
goods and services, but also an active producer and developer of cutting-edge technology and  
high  value  services.    However,  numerous  challenges  still  hinder  Rwanda’s  ICT  development.  
NICI  III  aims  to  address  these  challenges  and  presents  opportunities  that  Rwanda  can  take  
advantage of over the next five years to fast track the achievement of Vision 2020 goals.     
   
Energy:  Energy  access  and  high  costs  are  a  major  impediment  to  Rwanda’s  industry  and  
services  sectors.  The  country  has  low  per  capita  electricity  consumption  relative  to  the  East  
African Community with only 13% of the population having access to electricity, moreover with  
power outages. Electricity generation costs are high as well as the feed-in tariff of power  that

                                                                                                                                                 ( 
currently stands at 112 RWF/Kwh for households and RWF 102/kWh for industries, despite GoR  
subsidizing  the  utility.    Rwanda’s  electricity  costs  of  $0.24/Kwh,  almost  double  that  of  its  
neighbours. 64% of businesses surveyed in the 2008 business investment climate survey cited  
access  and  cost  of  electricity  as  a  major  constraint.    As  Rwanda  strives  to  increase  electricity  
generation,  ICTs  can  be  leveraged  to  consolidate  Rwanda’s  energy  sources  in  order  to  enable  
sustainable energy generation, transmission and distribution through a SMART Electricity Grid  
and Energy Market Design.   
  

Limited access to finance: Lending for ICT companies is constrained by costs and risks arising  
from several factors, including: lack of adequate collateral, crowding out by government bonds,  
asymmetrical  information  (caused  in  part  by  limited  private  credit  registries),  and  inadequate  
skills to assess and manage risk.  Limited lending can also be attributed to Rwanda’s low savings  
rate  that  currently  stands  at  8%  of  GDP.    GoR  should  partner  with  financial  institutions  to  
establish special funding mechanisms to foster ICT industry growth.   
  

Inadequate  international  bandwidth:  Rwanda  still  does  not  have  sufficient  international  
bandwidth.    Being  landlocked,  the  country  is  very  dependent  on  neighboring  countries  for  
connectivity, which greatly increases connectivity costs.  More importantly, given that ICT is a  
competitive  industry,  this  dependence  could  compromise  Rwanda’s  information  security  and  
business continuity.  This can be remedied through other links to other  sea cables  such as those  
from  southern  Africa  as  well  as  satellite  back  up.    Further,  a  virtual  landing  point  can  be  
established locally where telecommunication providers converge and acquire submarine capacity  
that can be distributed through their networks.    
  

Inadequate ICT skills: Rwanda has insufficient  skilled personnel  in the ICT field to drive ICT  
development.  As  such,  more  ICT  professionals  will  be  trained  and  developed  to  increase  
Rwanda’s ICT skills base.    
  

Low ICT awareness and usage:  Most Rwandans are still not aware of the  available ICTs and  
their benefits. This is largely attributed to the lack of awareness, insufficient content relevant to  
the   general   population   and   limited   rural   ICT   penetration.   ICT   in   education,   community  
development  and  public  awareness  initiatives  will  be  implemented  to  increase  ICT  awareness  
among Rwandans.     
  

Nascent private sector: Rwanda’s private sector, particularly the ICT sector, is relatively small.  
It is mostly constrained by the high cost of accessing ICTs especially in rural areas, insufficient  
payment systems and a lack of innovation.  Several initiatives will be implemented to foster ICT  
and  ICT-enabled  sector  development  including  establishing  a  Technopole  (an  advanced  ICT  
park),  e-Payment  systems,  a  national  access  network  to  increase  broadband  penetration  and  
Internet affordability among others in order to foster both ICT and ICT-enabled sector growth.   
  

Inadequate information security:  Rwanda’s cyber security needs to be reinforced to mitigate  
ever-increasing cyber threats. Cyber security awareness will need to be disseminated and public  
private   institutional   collaboration   strengthened.   Furthermore,   a   strong   policy,                                     legal   and  
regulatory framework to ensure cyber security and compliance will be required.  
  

Limited interoperability of government systems: Many government systems work in isolation  
of each other, which creates  duplication and  inefficient resource management.  Most processes  
are  to  a  large  extent  paper-based,  which  creates  unnecessary  delays.  As  such  ICTs  can  be  
leveraged        through        e-Government            initiatives       to   further      improve         government          operational  
effectiveness and efficiency, thereby improving service delivery to citizens.    
  

NICI  III  aims  to  address  the  above-mentioned  challenges  while  improving  Rwanda’s  ICT  
environment and accelerating services development.

PART 2: NICI III Focus areas  
This  section  highlights  the  methodology  employed  in  NICI  III  formulation  and  provides  the  
rationale, description, mission and objectives for each of the five focus areas.  
  
2.1.    Methodology   
  
NICI   III   focus   areas,   objectives   and   projects   were   generated   through   a   wide-range   of  
consultations to ensure ownership of the NICI III formulation process and implementation.   
  
The  formulation  process  began  by  setting  up  the  necessary  structure  and  identification  of  the  
following NICI III objectives.   
  
       1.  ICT to contribute significantly to GDP Growth  
      2.  ICT to run efficient government services  
      3.  ICT to improve business efficiency and productivity   
      4.  ICT  to  be  the  foundation  for  long  term  and  sustainable  economic  competitiveness   
            (service economy)  
  
This was followed by the identification  of  challenges hindering the achievement of the above- 
mentioned objectives and five focus areas that would address the identified challenges.   
  
Stakeholders  validated  the  above  objectives  and  articulated  the  mission,  objectives,  goals,  and  
projects  for all  focus areas. A detailed description of the stakeholders is elaborated in Appendix  
3.  
  
2.2.   Focus Area Rationale and Description  
  
NICI  III  focuses  on  five  key  areas  that  capture  crosscutting  national  challenges  and  provides  
mechanisms  through which Rwanda’s ICT vision will be attained. NICI III  focus areas are the  
following:  
             
          Skills Development [SD]  
          Private Sector Development [PSD]  
          Community Development [CD]  
          E-Government [e-GOV]  
          Cyber Security  [CS]  

2.2.1.   Skills Development [SD]  
  
Rwanda has a shortage both in terms of the quality and quantity of skilled personnel to drive ICT  
development as well as achieve EDPRS targets to develop required skills for a knowledge-based  
society.  Skills development is a national priority and also a foundation for the achievement of  
NICI III.  This focus area aims to build ICT professional skills and leverage ICTs in education in  
order  to  accelerate  skills  development.  The  scope  of  the  skills  development  is  two  fold;  first,  
build  ICT  professional  skills  that  will  increase  innovation  in  the  ICT  industry  and  enable  all  
sectors of the economy and second to leverage ICTs in education.

Mission:  “To develop a high quality skills and knowledge base leveraging ICT”  
  
Objectives  
  
1: (SD-01) Capacity building in ICT   
  
In   order   to   fully   maximize   and   realize   ICT   benefits,   Rwanda   must   greatly   boost   ICT  
competencies and skills. The capacities of the public and private sector as well as civil society to  
utilize ICTs must continuously be developed  in order to fast track the country’s transformation  
into a knowledge-based society.  
  
2: (SD-02) Foster Research & Development (R&D) to spur innovation   
  
Technological innovation is critical to  ICT and economic  development. Currently, Rwanda has  
limited  R&D  and  insufficient  institutional  capacity  to  innovate.  Investment  in  science  and  
technology  (S&T)  and  R&D  is  important  in  fostering  innovation  for  economic  transformation  
and must be part of a larger framework to build S&T institutional capabilities.  
  
3: (SD-03) Improve access to education and training through ICT   
  
Primary, secondary, vocational and tertiary education can be enhanced through  ICT  education  
and training tools, e-learning, content development and access to educational resources, in order  
to  foster innovation.   Since education delivery  involves both government and  non-government  
actors, ICTs can also be leveraged to ensure efficient delivery of informal education.  
  
2.2.2.   Private Sector Development [PSD]  
  
Entrepreneurship  fosters  innovation,  generates  wealth  and  creates  jobs  thereby  expanding  the  
tax-base   and   increasing   economic   development.   Achieving   Vision   2020   and   improving  
Rwanda’s   competitiveness   hinges   on   private   sector   led   development,   hence   the   need   to  
continuously  improve  the  enabling  environment  to  spur  growth  and  realize  EDPRS  goals  of  
widening and strengthening the financial sector; raising the contribution of services to economic  
development  and  building  an  economic  infrastructure.  Therefore,  a  specific  focus  on  growing  
and strengthening the ICT sector and other ICT enabled  sectors is of paramount importance in  
this plan. This focus area will also help address the national priority of developing viable SMEs.  
The scope of the private sector development is two  fold. First is to develop the ICT sector and  
second, a competitive and vibrant private sector leveraging ICT.  
  
Mission: “To develop a vibrant, competitive, and innovative ICT / ICT enabled private sector”  
  
Objectives   
  
1: (PSD-01) Support the development of a competitive ICT sector   
  
Today,  the  ICT  private  sector  lacks  sufficient  capital  to  start,  expand  and  develop  businesses.  
This is a key obstacle cited by ICT companies, which requires  significant attention. In addition,  
the lack of knowledge and technology transfer and innovation weakens the sector.

2: (PSD-02) Foster private sector growth through ICT    
  
ICT is an enabler of increased productivity and cost reduction.  Therefore, leveraging ICTs will  
greatly empower all key economic sectors i.e. infrastructure, mining, trade and manufacturing,  
agriculture, energy, tourism, financial services thereby increasing their competitiveness.    
  
3: (PSD-03) Increase ICT sector contribution to GDP   
  
ICT has been identified as a key contributor to Vision 2020 yet its economic contribution to GDP  
is not currently quantified. Therefore, it is important for ICT GDP contributions to be measured  
and enumerated to determine impact on economic growth and returns on ICT investments.    
  
2.2.3.   Community Development [CD]  
  
Community  development  is  critical  to  achieving  socio-economic  development  goals.  Though  
broad  in  scope,  in  this  plan  CD  is  a  community-centric  approach  to  the  deployment  of  ICT  
thereby  strengthening  and  developing  communities.  Specific  focus  on  CD  is  imperative  to  
fostering  and  increasing  citizen  participation  in  the  country’s  development.  This  focus  area  
contributes  to  the  realization  of  MDGs  including  poverty  alleviation,  health,  and  education.  
Furthermore   it   contributes   to   the   achievement   of   EDPRS   goals   of   building   economic  
infrastructure and improving health status.  The  scope of community development is three fold.  
First is to increase ICT  access, awareness and usage within communities. Second is to improve  
citizens’  access  to  information  thereby  increasing  their  participation  through  ICT.  Third  is  to  
facilitate the provision of basic services (education and health) to communities using ICT.   
  
Mission:  “To empower and transform communities through improved access to information  
and services”  
  
Objectives  
  
1: (CD-01) Promote ICT awareness in communities   
  
A systematic approach to promoting ICT awareness and its benefits is of paramount importance.  
This will undoubtedly increase utilization, adoption, and ownership of deployed ICTs. Therefore,  
increased  ICT  awareness  campaigns  countrywide,  such  as  the  November  2010  National  ICT  
week, newspaper articles, ICT competitions/awards and media campaigns will be necessary.  
  
2:   (CD-02)   Establish   and   institutionalize   ICT-enhanced   systems   to   increase   citizen  
participation and improve access to services and information   
  
Citizen  participation  is  at  the  core  of  economic  development  and  good  governance.  ICTs  can  
greatly  enhance  extensive  participation  by  providing  affordable  and  efficient  ways  to  extend  
services  and  information  to  communities.  This  will  also  greatly  improve  local  government  
transparency and accountability.

3: (CD-03) Improve healthcare delivery through ICT   
  
Healthcare initiatives and services can be more efficiently delivered to Rwandans by  leveraging  
ICTs to improve healthcare access and service delivery for all communities.      
  
2.2.4.   e-Government [e-GOV]  
  
E-Government aims to integrate all government processes such that government operates under a  
“ONE  government”  system  in  order  to  improve  service  delivery  to  citizens/businesses.  This  
focus  area  ensures  sustained  improvements  in  government  service  provision  and  delivery  by  
simplifying  Government-to-Citizen  (G2C)  services  to  continuously  improve  the  social  and  
governance  clusters;   Government-to-Business  (G2B)   services  to  continuously  improve  the  
economic  cluster,  and  Government-to-Government  (G2G)  processes  to  continuously  improve  
government efficiency.  The scope of the e-Government (e-Gov) is three fold. First is to improve  
both   government   business   processes   and   communication.   Second   is   to   increase   citizen  
participation in the country’s socio-economic development and third is to improve the  legal and  
regulatory environment that enables Rwanda to adapt to emerging technologies.  
  
Mission:  “To improve government operational efficiency and service delivery”  
  
Objectives  
  
1:  (e-Gov-01)  Improve  communication  and  reduce  barriers  to  government  transactions  
through ICT   
  
Barriers  to  transactions  in  government  slow  down  public  service  delivery.  Therefore,  it  is  
imperative that all government institutions establish the appropriate and effective communication  
mechanisms and an institutional framework that facilitates this seamless transition.    
  
2: (e-Gov-02) Streamline government business processes using ICT   
  
Government  can  be  efficient  and  effective  when  all  business  processes  are  streamlined.  The  
deployment and application of ICTs is the most efficient way to transform processes that foster  
efficiency and reduce the cost of delivering services in a sustainable manner.  
  
3: (e-Gov-03) Increase transparency and accountability in government processes through  
ICT    
  
Transparency and accountability are key indicators of good governance.  Therefore, it is critical  
that government is more responsive to citizen needs by leveraging ICTs in order to improve and  
increase transparency and accountability.   
  
4: (e-Gov-04) Foster a conducive legal and regulatory environment to allow easy adaptation  
to emerging technologies    
  
ICTs  are  constantly  evolving.    Therefore,  it  is  imperative  that  the  ICT  legal  and  regulatory  
environment  is  flexible  to  ensure  easy  adaptation  to  technological  changes  and  that  Rwanda  
seizes new technology opportunities.

2.2.5.   Cyber Security [CS]  
  
Cyber  security  is  at  the  core  of  a  knowledge-based  society  and  as  such  must  be  a  national  
priority.  It  ensures  secure  management  of  all  deployed  ICT  assets  that  support  all  facets  of  
Rwanda’s   ICT   goals.   To   fully   realize   ICT   benefits,   there   must   be   full   confidence   that  
information  and  communication  systems  are  secure  and  dependable.  The  Internet  exposes  
Rwandans  to  global  networks,  which  are  prone  to  advanced  and  repeated  cyber-attacks.   
Therefore,  Rwanda  must  continue  investing  in  IT  and  information  security  to  ensure  the  
protection and  integrity of national information  and ICT assets.  The scope of cyber security is  
three fold. First is to increase the level of cyber security awareness and protect key ICT assets  
against  attacks.  Second  is  to  build  local  capabilities  to  respond  to  attacks  as  well  as  foster  
international cooperation on cyber security. Third is to create a legal and regulatory environment  
to mitigate cyber vulnerabilities.  
  
Mission: “To secure Rwanda’s cyberspace and information assets”  
  
Objectives  
  
1: (CS-01) Develop cyber security awareness   
  
Rwanda’s ICT infrastructure demands that every Rwandan participate in safeguarding it. Cyber  
attacks can come in the form of virus-infested hardware or casual access to malicious sites that  
cause  serious  harm  to  the  country’s  critical  infrastructure.  Therefore,  to  fully  safeguard  ICT  
infrastructure assets, all Rwandans must learn about ICT security, which requires due diligence.    
  
2: (CS-02) Build Cyber-security capabilities   
  
Building  appropriate  cyber  security  capabilities  is  critical  to  ensuring  that  Rwanda  possesses  
adequate and relevant capacity to counter any attacks. While  ICT infrastructure is protected by  
built in state-of-the-art security technology and solutions, it is extremely important that Rwanda  
builds  national  capacity  to  safeguard  ICT  assets,  as  built  in  protection  is  not  sufficient  and  
sustainable.    
  
3:  (CS-03)  Ensure  Rwanda’s  critical  infrastructure  and  systems  protection  from  cyber  
attacks   
  
Rwanda built state-of-the-art ICT infrastructure during NICI II. However, impending attacks on  
the country are of grave concern and pose real and credible threats to deployed assets. Therefore,  
it is imperative that there is adequate planning to ensure mechanisms are in place to counter or  
mitigate future threats.   
  
4:  (CS-04)  Foster  national  and  international  cooperation  to  handle  cyber  crimes  and  
threats   
  
Cyber attacks are increasingly global in nature and as such, it is no longer feasible or appropriate  
to  simply  handle  them  at  a  national  level.  Therefore,  global  cooperation  and  collaboration  to  
safeguard interdependent infrastructure and mitigate the effects of cyber attacks is increasingly  
necessary.

5: (CS-05) Improve legal and regulatory environment to ensure and support cyber security    
  
A  conducive  legal  and  regulatory  environment  compliments  this  initiative  to  ensure  efficient  
protection of cyber infrastructure. It is important that Rwanda puts in place an adequate legal and  
regulatory framework to support deployed and changing cyber security measures.

SD Project 1: ICT Professional Training and Certification Programs     

  
Purpose:  To continuously develop a competent and relevant ICT professional base that meets  
international and industry needs in order to accelerate Rwanda’s ICT development  
  
Description:   
Rwanda has a dearth of skills needed to drive ICT development. The private sector identified the  
lack  of  adequate  ICT  skills  and  the  cost  of  professional  ICT  training/certification  as  key  
challenges.    Graduating  students  for  the  most  part  do  not  have  hands-on  training  that  meets  
industry needs thus requiring significant financial resources to train them. Given that the private  
sector is young and has limited capital, it is imperative that government provides  the necessary  
support  to  enable  the  ICT  sector  acquire  relevant  skills.    Therefore,  in  order  to  fast  track  
Rwanda’s ICT development and transformation into a knowledge-based economy, there must be  
programs designed to train ICT personnel and campaigns to attract more Rwandans in the field  
of   ICT,   particularly   Technical,   Vocational   Education   and   Training   (TVET)   Institutions.   
Institutions of higher learning such  as TVET and Universities as well as the private sector can  
collaborate to ensure the development of industry specific skills.  This project aims to increase  
home grown ICT expertise that meets national, regional, and global ICT needs.    
  
Activities:  
1.   Conduct ICT skills assessment  
2.   Incorporate ICT Professional certification courses in the teaching curriculum for institutions  
     of higher learning    
3.   Develop  an  ICT  training  programme  to  subsidize  specialized  training  for  Rwandan  ICT  
     professionals   
4.   Enforce public servant ICT certification

SD Program: EDUNet   

  
Purpose: To increase ICT usage at all educational levels  
  
Description:   
The  EDUNet  program  aims  to  provide  ICT  infrastructure  and  connectivity  for  all  educational  
levels. It integrates several ICT in education projects for primary, secondary, tertiary institutions  
and non-formal education.   
  

SD Project 2: SchoolNet   

  
Purpose:  To increase ICT usage in 12-year basic education (YBE)  schools  thereby  enhancing  
teaching and learning through ICT   
  
Description:   
Most  schools  do  not  have  reliable  connectivity  due  to  electricity  problems  and  high  Internet  
costs. This is project, rolled-over from NICI II, aims to provide connectivity in all schools further  
bridging the urban-rural digital divide, and  enhancing teaching and learning through the use of  
technology tools and promoting universal computer literacy in Rwanda’s schools. It builds on the  
numerous ICT in education initiatives such as One Laptop per Child (OLPC) project and aims to  
ensure that all primary school students have access to ICT.   To date 110,000 laptops have been  
imported of which  56,000 laptops were distributed to primary 4-6  kids in 113 primary schools  
countrywide. However, numerous challenges still impede ICT advancement in primary schools.  
In  2010,  only  13%  of  primary  schools  had  electricity  and  88%  of  primary  schools  accessed  
telephone  services  through  headmasters’  mobile  phones.  Other  challenges  include  inadequate  
technical support and insufficient resources to meet the demand.  Therefore, it is necessary for  
Rwanda to adopt strategies that ensure resources are maximized in order to realize ICT goals.    
  
Activities:  
1.   Enhance and promote ICT utilization in the teaching and learning process with a particular  
     focus on technical education  
2.   Provide ICT infrastructure and connectivity to all schools  
3.   Increase availability of quality ICT technical support for schools

 PSD Project 2: e-Payment Systems  
  
Purpose: To simplify business transactions in Rwanda   
  
Description:  
This project aims to put in place  e-payment  mechanism to support online transactions  thereby  
fostering e-Commerce.   E-Commerce, the online buying and  selling of goods and services, is a  
missing  component  of  the  Rwandan  business  environment,  which  is  mostly  cash-based.  Key  
prerequisites for e-Commerce including the electronic transaction and signature law,  copyright  
and intellectual property rights law, an e-Payment policy and mobile payments currently exist in  
Rwanda   and   have   laid   a   foundation   for   e-Commerce.   However,   the   lack   of   adequate  
infrastructure; wariness of business and consumers to conduct business electronically; security  
concerns  and  lack  of  awareness  hinder  the  adoption  and  usage  of  electronic  payments.  This  
project also aims to address these challenges.  
  
Activities:   
1.   Develop and implement cash electronification mechanism  
2.   Harmonize regulations with regional and international operators to facilitate mobile money  
     banking  
3.   Develop implementation matrix to accelerate the deployment of mobile money access points  
     across the country   
4.   Build capacity of mobile banking resellers  
5.   Establish incentives to stimulate e-Payments usage  
6.   Conduct financial literacy campaigns   
       
Expected Outcome:   
1.   Improved efficiency in business transactions  
2.   Increased ICT usage and penetration   
3.   Reduced transaction costs  
4.   Increased financial access and inclusion

PSD Project 5: Virtual Landing Point  
  
Purpose:    To  increase  Rwanda’s  international  capacity  and  eliminate  additional  costs  of  
acquiring international capacity for operators   
  
Description:  
A  Virtual  Landing  Point  (VLP)  is  a  central  location  where  telecommunication  providers  can  
meet and acquire submarine bandwidth  capacity to distribute through their networks. Countries  
bordering the sea generally construct fiber cable landing stations. Being a landlocked country,  
Rwanda cannot construct such a facility. However, a virtual instance of the same is possible and  
would be the point of choice for all international link providers to terminate their networks  and  
deliver  their  services  to  local  network  providers.  Coupling  the  VLP  with  the  existing  local  
Internet Exchange Point (IXP) is efficient since operators’ networks are already reaching the IXP  
thereby eliminating additional costs of acquiring international capacity.   
  
Activities:  
 1.   Prepare VLP site  
2.   Acquire   and   install   VLP   hardware   (Racks,   Routers,   Switches,   Servers,   Transmission  
      equipment) and software  
       
Expected Outcome:  
 1.   VLP fully operational by 2013  
2.   Low throughput from VLP to end users  
3.   Simplified international capacity acquisition for telecommunication providers  
4.   Reduction in cost of Internet and a boost in ISP industry  
       
Outcome Indicators:  
 1.   50% reduction in wholesale bandwidth costs  
2.   99.5% reliability and availability of bandwidth by 2013  
  

PSD Project 6: Access Network  

  
Purpose: To extend Internet access across the country in order to bridge Rwanda’s digital divide   
  
Description:  
The national fiber optic backbone network has been completed and is available in all 30 districts.  
However, not all end-users i.e. schools, hospitals, government offices, commercial buildings etc.  
are centrally located in districts. This project aims to bridge the gap between the backbone nodes  
and  end-user  premises  by  means  of  wireless  or  fiber.  In  doing  so,  it  is  expected  that  all  
telecommunication  providers  will  expand  their  customer  base  using  the  same  access  points  
thereby increasing their revenue streams while transforming businesses and lives across Rwanda.

CD Project 5: Community Health Worker Reporting and Information System  

  
Purpose: To improve community health workers’ reporting and information sharing  
  
Description:  
There  are  numerous  healthcare  interventions  offered  at  the  community  level,  mainly  by  
community health workers. Currently there are approximately 60,000 health workers, four per  
village (umudugudu), who collect and report maternal and child health data among other MDG  
indicators. Although every health worker is equipped with a mobile phone and RapidSMS and  
mUbuzima is operational in few parts of the country, most reporting remains paper-based.  This  
delays reporting and data collection, hence the need for automation.

CD Project 6: Health Insurance Information System  

  
Purpose: To improve healthcare delivery  
  
Description:  
Health  insurance  plays  a  critical  role  in  healthcare  provision  by  increasing  accessibility  to  
healthcare  services.    In  Rwanda  there  are  two  main  health  insurance  schemes:  RAMA  and  
Mutuelle de Santé, with  over 90% Rwandans covered by Mutuelle de Santé.  However, all its  
services  including  authentication  and  claim  processing  are  paper-based,  which  translates  into  
long  reconciliation  processes  between  healthcare  providers  and  insurance  thereby  hindering  
effective  operations  and  in-turn  quality  of  service  delivery.  This  project  aims  to  automate  all  
health  insurance  services  hence  allowing  for  swift  and  seamless  insurance  claims  processing,  
which will greatly improve health care service delivery.   
  
Activities:  
 1.  Develop a health insurance database  
 2.  Automate insurance claims and re-imbursement   
 3.  Integrate National ID (NID) with health insurance for authentication purposes   
 4.  Increase awareness and sensitization on the system   
  
Expected Outcome:   
1.   Enabled “patient roaming” i.e. patient can receive treatment anywhere in the country  
2.   Seamless health insurance claims processing   
3.   A unique patient identifier integrated with NID    
   
Outcome Indicators:  
1.   Health Insurance Information System fully operational by 2013  
2.   Processing time for insurance claims  
  

CD Project 7: Telemedicine   

  
Purpose: To improve accessibility and affordability of specialized healthcare services in remote  
areas   
  
Description:     
Telemedicine  is  an  application  of  clinical  medicine  where  medical  information  is  transferred  
through  audio-visual  media  and  other  technologies  for  purposes  of  diagnosing  or  treating  
patients. This is a rolled over project, currently being implemented in three teaching hospitals  
and two rural hospitals in Musanze and Kabgayi that are connected to King Faisal Hospital. This  
needs to be scaled-out to all health institutions across the country. However, challenges including  
inadequate  infrastructure,  lack  of  connectivity  and  inadequate  trained  staff  still  impede  the  
development of telemedicine in Rwanda.  
  
Activities:  
1.   Develop and deploy telemedicine solutions in selected health facilities# 
2.   Provide reliable connectivity and electricity

will enable air craft operators to meet their planned times of departure and arrival, and adhere to  
their preferred flight profiles with minimum constraints and without compromising agreed safety  
levels.  Rwanda  has  been  selected  to  host  the  Communication  Navigation  Surveillance  /Air  
Traffic Management (CNS/ATM) for all COMESA member states and therefore must be ready  
to  effectively  manage  the  system.  It  will  enable  a  regional  unified  air  space  management  that  
would  control  navigation  services.  The  centre  will  be  based  at  Karisimbi  in  the  Northern  
Province, where GoR has deployed communication infrastructure. This project is also aimed at  
ensuring that Rwanda is ready to host regional CNS-ATM.

PART 4: INSTITUTIONAL AND IMPLEMENTATION FRAMEWORK  
This section describes the institutional and implementation framework of the NICI III plan  
including specific roles and responsibilities for each institution and the framework that will  
guide the development of FY2013 - 2015 projects.   
  
4.1.        NICI III Institutional and Implementation Framework   
  
Success  of  the  NICI  III  Plan  will  depend  on  the  effectiveness  of  its  implementation.    NICI  II  
evaluation revealed deficiencies in project planning, coordination, monitoring and evaluation and  
as such recommended the strengthening of planning, coordination and M&E functions in RDB.  
NICI  III  aims  to  address  these  issues  by  creating  a  strong  institutional  framework  to  support  
implementation in order to achieve tangible and measurable outcomes.  
  
NICI III implementation requires the participation of all stakeholders including the National ICT  
implementation   steering   committee,   the   project   implementers,   RDB   as   well   as   a   strong  
monitoring and evaluation component.  
  
The figure below illustrates the NICI III institutional framework.

4.1.1.   National ICT Steering Committee (NISC)   
  
The  NISC  will  be  chaired  by  the  Minister  in  Charge  of  ICT  in  the  Office  of  the  President  
(MINICT) as it is the lead government agency charged with ICT.  For increased accountability  
and  effective  implementation,  a  steering  committee  will  oversee  the  plan.  NISC  will  be  
comprised  of  eminent  Rwandan  and  international  experts  providing  strategic  direction  and  
guidance to the NICI process as well as other GoR ICT initiatives. This will  expedite decision- 
making, foster and increase participation of  all  stakeholders.  MINICT roles and responsibilities  
are to:   
  
     •    Develop and disseminate ICT policies, strategies and programs,  and mobilize resources  
          for sector programs.   
     •    Oversee  and  coordinate  the  implementation  of  national  ICT  programs  as  well  as  
          Institutions and Agencies under supervision.  
     •    Monitor and evaluate the implementation of sector and sub!sector policies, strategies and  
          programs.  
     •    Promote the integration, adoption and use of ICT in all areas of our society and economy.  
     •    Coordinate with international agencies and institutions working in the sector of ICT.  
     •    Promote institutional and human resources capacities and professional skills development  
          in the sector.  
            
Given the above roles and responsibilities, MINICT will set the NISC agenda.  NISC roles and  
responsibilities are to:    

     •    Balance the demand and supply for ICT to ensure ICT investments are aligned with the  
          National ICT vision;   
     •    Monitor value delivery to ensure ICT initiatives/projects attain optimum benefits;  
     •    Risk management of new ICT initiatives/projects to facilitate transparency and  
          understanding of compliance requirements;  
     •    Ensure proper resource management to facilitate knowledge and infrastructure  
          optimization; and  
     •    Performance measurement to track strategy implementation.    

The  NISC  will  report  to  the  Office  of  the  President  to  ensure  accountability  and  effective  
implementation of the NICI plan.  NISC will also collaborate with the joint-sector working group  
(JWG) to review NICI III progress and mobilize resources.  The ministry will form technical and  
policy and strategy committees comprised of national and international experts that will advise  
key national ICT strategic initiatives, and more importantly advise long-term strategic alignment  
of ICT to National goals.  These committees must ensure that projects are implemented taking  
into account the most suitable business models.  The roles and responsibilities of the NISC are  
follows:    

     •    Bi-annual  review  of  the  NICI  III  implementation  progress  to  ensure  that  appropriate  
          improvements are incorporated and aligned with NICI III objectives   
     •    Mobilization of resources   
     •    NICI III advocacy

Project implementer  
  
The NICI II medium-term review and final evaluation identified lack of project ownership by  
Ministries, Departments and Agencies (MDAs) as a major shortcoming. Accordingly, in NICI  
III, each project will have a nominated project manager/implementer. The project implementer is  
a specific institution in charge of executing specific projects under the NICI plan. The roles and  
responsibilities of the project implementer are as follows:   
  
1.   Creating, establishing and managing project plans while ensuring that projects are completed  
     on time and within budget  
2.   Communicate project progress to RDB on a monthly basis  
3.   Control and manage the operational budget  
4.   Coordinate project activities and consult with RDB to ensure project deadlines and objectives  
     are met.  
       
4.1.2.   RDB  
  
RDB  will  lead  implementation  of  the  NICI  III  Plan  as  the  designated  coordination  and  
implementing agency of GoR ICT initiatives. The Planning and Coordination and New Project  
Development (NPD) divisions within the ICT Department will assume the functions of the NICI  
III Secretariat given their mandate as follows:  
  
     •    RDB  Planning  and  Coordination  division  is  mandated  to  plan  and  coordinate  all  GoR  
          ICT  projects  in  collaboration  with  all  relevant  MDAs  to  ensure  implementation  in  a  
          harmonised and coordinated manner.  
     •    RDB  New  Project  Development  division  is  mandated  to  coordinate  and  oversee  the  
           successful  implementation  of  all  GoR  ICT  projects  in  collaboration  with  the  project  
          implementing institutions.  

NICI II evaluation identified the lack of capacity within the above divisions as the main obstacle  
to  the  successful  implementation  of  the  NICI  projects.  Therefore,  these  divisions  must  be  
strengthened and equipped with the right resources, particularly the monitoring and evaluation  
and  policy  and  strategy  units  of  the  planning  and  coordination  division,  to  ensure  successful  
implementation going forward.   
  
RDB will work hand-in-hand with stakeholders (focus area working groups-FWG) in developing  
new projects and assessing the progress and outcome of implemented NICI projects. Focus area  
working  groups  comprise  of  subject  matter  experts  from  public  and  private  sectors  as  well  as  
civil society.  
  
The planning and coordination unit will have the following responsibilities:  
  
Project Formulation:  
     •    Coordinate new project formulation.  
     •    Conduct  research  and  facilitate  FWG   stakeholder  consultations  to  ensure  industry  
          participation during project formulation.  
     •    Continuous improvement of project toolkits to ensure successful NICI III formulation.

Project Implementation:  
      •    Oversee effective management of projects to ensure efficient resource utilization.  
      •    Prepare  and  circulate  quarterly  project  status  reports  for  NICI  III  implementation  
           institutions to ensure alignment with cluster and project objectives.  
      •    Organise FWG meetings to ensure project ownership and smooth implementation.  
             
Monitoring & Evaluation (M&E):  
  
Building on international best practices the following M&E activities are proposed:  
  
      •    Develop a results-based monitoring framework for all focus area projects   
             
The recommended M&E log frame structure is as follows:  
  

                                                                                                                                           
  
      •    Select a sub-set of so-called SMART indicators for on-going data gathering and reporting  
           (simple, measurable, attainable, reliable, and tractable)  
      •    Define precisely the nature and format of the data to be captured  
      •    Design data input forms for each project to enable routine capture of indicator data  
      •    Plan and initiate periodic (monthly, quarterly, etc.) data collection by relevant  
           implementing agencies  
      •    Design and implement a data capture system (excel, access, etc.) and online reporting  
           format  
      •    Gather, validate, capture and report indicator data at regular intervals to ensure  
           conformance with project activities, and objective verification of project outputs and  
           outcomes  
      •    Compile quarterly M&E reports with NICI III implementing institutions for submission  
           to relevant stakeholders  
      •    Provide recommendations to the NICI III implementing institutions on how to improve  
           the implementation process  
        
External Monitoring and Evaluation  
  
RDB should continue to leverage external M&E experts to ensure objective evaluation of project  
outputs and outcomes. This independent evaluation should be undertaken on a yearly basis. The  
external M&E experts will carry out the following functions:  
  
      •    Verify  the  M&E  processes  of  the  Planning  and  Coordination  Unit  within  RDB/ICT,

PART 5: CONCLUSION   
  
Rwanda,  through  the  NICI  process,  has  achieved  remarkable  ICT  developments  in  the  last  
decade  by  creating  an  enabling  environment  and  deploying  necessary  infrastructure  as  the  
foundation  for  ICT  development.  These  achievements  are  unparalleled  among  developing  
countries  and  are  frequently  cited  as  a  best  example  of  a  government’s  strategic  resolve  to  
harness ICTs as a tool for development. June 2011 marks the end of NICI II and the beginning of  
NICI III as Rwanda continues her ICT transformation.    
  
Through  lessons  learned  from  previous  plans,  the  NICI  III  formulation  process  has  been  
inclusive in order to foster ownership of the plan ensuring outcomes are concretely defined. This  
has  been  achieved  through  the  participation  of  all  stakeholders  that  will  be  critical  to  the  
implementation process.    
  
A major improvement to the NICI III plan is the adoption of annual/biennial project cycles.  In  
the rapidly evolving ICT world, it is difficult to capture opportunities and challenges in rigid 5- 
year plans. This new approach will ensure that the initiatives adapt to socio-economic changes  
and emerging technologies. This phased approach will also ensure that the identified projects are  
executed with clear outcomes that are aligned with NICI III  focus area  mission and objectives  
supported  by  a  toolkit  that  can  facilitate  rapid  deployment  of  initiatives  while  capturing  new  
opportunities.    
  
The next five years will be the most critical to Rwanda’s transformation into a knowledge-based  
economy  as  NICI  III  aims  to  accelerate  service  development  and  advance  Rwanda’s  ICT  and  
development agenda.

APPENDICES  

APPENDIX 1: NICI II: KEY LESSONS LEARNED AND RECOMMENDATIONS   
  
1.    NICI Pillars and Projects   
        
The  large  scope  of  NICI  strategy  &  plan  demands  an  organising  principle.  However,  the  link  
between pillars and lead agencies became more tenuous during NICI II implementation process  
and this was pointed out as a possible reason why the project status varied considerably between  
different pillars. It also may explain lack of coordination under NICI II. In the evaluation, some  
lessons learned for overall plan implementation include:  
     •     Lack of a committed leader in each pillar, with the responsibility and authority to guide  
           implementation of all the projects within his or her brief.   
     •     Lack  of  involvement  of  pillar/focus  area  communities  that  constantly  monitor  and  
           support the implementation effort.   
     •     Lack of ownership of initiatives by stakeholders.  
     •     Lack  of  close  coordination  across  areas,  which  would  have  ensured  that  dependencies  
           and sequencing of activities were appropriate.   
  
2.    NICI Outcomes and Impacts   
        
While there are many positive stories from NICI II projects, there have been little objective and  
verifiable  evidences  to  verify  these  claims.  NICI  II  projects  had  clear  outputs  but  almost  no  
indicators  to  measure  outcomes  and  impacts.  One  result  of  this  has  been  real  difficulty  on  
carrying   out   an   independent   evaluation   of   NICI   II.   But   more   importantly,   the   lack   of  
measurement at output and outcome levels prevented effective monitoring of progress, financial  
and operational, and evaluation in relation to ultimate goals. This needs to be remedied under  
NICI III implementation process.  
  
3.    NICI Governance   
        
During NICI I and II implementation,  the institution mandated to manage the process (RITA)  
underwent considerable institutional and management change. While in 2008 the mandate and  
functions  of  RITA  was  transferred  to  the  new  Rwanda  Development  Board  under  RDB/ICT,  
organizational restructuring was not complete until recently. This has made it challenging for the  
smooth and coordinated NICI II project implementation. The NICI II evaluation pointed out this  
fact and called for a stable and clear governance structure to be put in place and made clear to all  
stakeholders.  At  the  operational  level,  NICI  II  evaluation  pointed  out  several  challenges  in  
Governance which include:   
     •     Detailed  project  selection  and  sequencing  based  on  dependencies  were  not  clearly  
           defined.  
     •     Lack of staff and changing relations with collaborating MDAs made it very difficult to  
           manage and execute an ambitious set of projects.   
     •     Project analysis and design was not elaborated –  need for results based framework (or  
           logical  analysis  framework)  with  objectives,  inputs,  outputs,  practical  indicators  of  
           successful achievement of outputs and outcomes, targets for achievement etc.   
     •     Lack  of  information  sharing  and  weak  project  management  –  consolidated  project  
           management  information  was  not  shared  among  stakeholders  to  improve  relevant  
           projects.

4.    Monitoring and Evaluation   
        
While  there  are  M&E  specialists  in  RDB/ICT  and  Ministry  of  ICT  since  2008,  detailed  
recommendations  to  improve  the  M&E  structure  of  the  NICI  II  implementation,  which  were  
offered by consultants working on the EDPRS and subsequently picked up in the NICI II MTR,  
were  not  instituted.  Feedback  from  NICI  II  evaluation  clearly  pointed  out  the  importance  of  
structured M&E to capture real outcomes of the NICI initiatives. The evaluation also pointed to  
the  fact  that  a  coordinated  M&E  approach  between  RDB/ICT  and  MINICT  is  essential  under  
NICI III.  
  
Key Recommendations for NICI III  
  
Improve NICI Governance structure   
     •    Improve the efficiency and effectiveness of public institutions in implementing national  
          ICT programs.  
     •    Facilitate the monitoring and evaluation of ICT program based on socio-economic impact  
          factor assessment.  
     •     Streamline       information        sharing      and     knowledge         management          by    decreasing        the  
          transaction  costs  between  government  institutions  and  agencies  through  transparent  
          reporting framework.  
     •     Strengthen the coordination of public-private partnerships initiatives.  
     •    Promote  the  adoption  and  dissemination  of  best  project  management  practices  in  
          implementing national ICT planned actions.
