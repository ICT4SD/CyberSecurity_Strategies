The 16th National Congress of the Chinese Communist Party commissioned the formulation 
of an outline for a national medium- and long-term program for science and technology 
development in the context of the full-fledged construction of a well-to-do society and accelerating 
the socialist modernization drive, and the State Council has hereby prepared the following outline 
in compliance with the request. 

 

I . Preface 

Since the founding of the People’s Republic of China, especially since the introduction of 
the policy of reform and opening to the outside world, the nation’s socialist modernization drive 
has attained universally acknowledged achievements. However, one has to be keenly aware that 
the nation is and will remain at a primary stage of socialism for a long time to come. In our effort 
to build a well-to-do society, we are faced with both rare historic opportunities and grave 
challenges. The nation’s economic growth shows an excessive dependence on the consumption of 
energy and resources, with high associated environmental costs; the economic structure is 
irrational, characterized by a frail agricultural base and lagging high-tech industry and modern 
service industry; and firms lack core competitiveness and their economic returns are yet to be 
improved as a result of weak indigenous innovation capability. There are a whole range of 
problems concerning employment, distribution, health care, and national security that need prompt 
solution. Internationally, the nation will be for a long period of time under enormous pressures 
from developed nations who possess economic and S&T superiority. In order to grasp the 
opportunities and meet the challenges, we must make all-round efforts, including coordinated 
overall development, deepening the system reform, improving democracy and the rule of law, and 
reinforcing social management. At the same time, we need to depend even more heavily on S&T 
progress and innovation in order to achieve substantial gains in productivity and advance the 
overall economic and social development in a coordinated and sustainable manner. 

 

As the premier productive forces, science and technology are a concentrated reflection and a 
major hallmark of advanced productivity. In the 21st century, the new science and technology 


revolution is rapidly unfolding and gestating significant new breakthroughs, which will profoundly 
change the economic and social visages. Advances in information science and technology, still in 
the ascendant, will continue to be the dominant driving force for economic growth; rapid advances 
in life science and biotechnology will play a key role in improving quality of life; renewed efforts 
in energy science and technology will open up new avenues for addressing global energy and 
environmental issues; and exciting new breakthroughs in nanometer science and nanotechnology 
will usher in a profound technology revolution. Exciting breakthroughs in basic research fields 
will create whole new horizons for science and technology development and economic growth. 
S&T achievements are being applied and transferred at an ever faster pace, thus creating new 
opportunities for catching up and leapfrogging. Therefore, we shall embrace the new era, meeting 
both opportunities and challenges brought on by the new S&T revolution with a global vision. In 
today’s world, many countries have made S&T innovation a national strategy and S&T inputs 
strategic investments by drastically increasing R&D spending. These nations lead the world in 
deploying and developing frontier technologies and strategic industries and implement important 
S&T programs in an attempt to enhance their national innovative capability and international 
competitiveness. Confronted with the new international situation, we must have a greater sense of 
responsibility and urgency, by making S&T progress a major driving force for the economic and 
social development more conscientiously and resolutely. We must place the strengthening of 
indigenous innovative capability at the core of economic restructuring, growth model change, and 
national competitiveness enhancement. Building an innovation-oriented country is therefore a 
major strategic choice for China’s future development. 

 

Over more than five decades since the founding of New China, the consistent and painstaking 
efforts of several generations have led to huge, heartening achievements in the fields of science 
and technology. Major S&T accomplishments hallmarked by nuclear weaponry and satellite 
technology, manned space flights, hybrid rice, theory of oil formation from continental moist 
depression and associated application, and high performance computers, have greatly enhanced 
the nation’s comprehensive national strength, uplifted its international position, and inspired the 
whole nation. However, compared with the developed nations, China’s overall S&T level still has 
a fairly big gap to close, compared with that of developed nations. This is mainly reflected in the 
following areas: we have a low rate of sufficiency in key technology supply and a limited number 
of invention patents; the technological level remains low in some regions, particularly in the rural 
areas of the central and western regions; the quality of scientific research still needs significant 
improvement due to a shortage of top notch S&T talents; and investments in science and 
technology are still insufficient; and there are numerous loopholes in the existing S&T system. 
Despite the size of economy, our country is not yet an economic power primarily because of our 
weak innovative capacity. 

 

In the 21st century, China, being a large developing nation, is to accelerate its S&T 
development and narrow down the gaps with the developed nations. To this end, the nation must 
make unremitting efforts for a long period of time, while it is also blessed with numerous favorable 
conditions. 

 

First, China’s sustained fast economic growth and social development creates a huge demand 
and thus lay a solid foundation for the S&T development. Second, the nation has a fairly 
consummate system of academic disciplines, with a huge pool of talented people. It has developed 


world-class R&D capability in a number of major fields, thus positioning itself for tremendous 
S&T developments in the future. Third, our country’s continued opening to the outside world has 
enhanced its S&T cooperation and exchanges with the rest of the world, allowing the country to 
share the fruits from the new S&T revolution. Fourth, by adhering to the socialist system, China 
is able to combine the political advantage of mobilizing efforts to do great things and the basic 
role of market mechanism in effectively allocating resources. This provides an important system 
guarantee for the prosperous development of S&T activities. Fifth, ours is a country with a 5000-
year history of civilization and a culture that is both broad and profound, capable of incorporating 
things of diverse nature, which favors the creation of a uniquely innovative culture. As long as we 
strengthen our national confidence, hold scientific concept of development, implement the 
strategies of rejuvenating the nation through science and education, work hard to catch up over the 
next 15 years or more, we will be able to produce brilliant S&T achievements that live up to the 
expectations of our times. 

 

II. Guiding Principles, Development Goals, and General Deployment 

 

1. Guiding Principles 


 

The first 20 years of the century are a period of important strategic opportunities for our 
country’s economic and social development and S&T progress. Under the guidance of Deng 
Xiaoping Theory and the “Three Representations” and by implementing the scientific concept of 
development and the strategy of rejuvenating the nation through science and education and talented 
people and proceeding from our own national conditions and taking people-based approach, 
deepening reforms and expanding the opening to the outside world, we must strive for the 
prosperous development of China’s scientific and technological enterprise so as to realize the goals 
of the full-fledged construction of a well-to-do society and provide powerful S&T support for 
building a harmonious socialist society. 

 

The guiding principles for our S&T undertakings over the next 15 years are: “indigenous 
innovation, leapfrogging in priority fields, enabling development, and leading the future”. 
Indigenous innovation refers to enhancing original innovation, integrated innovation, and re-
innovation based on assimilation and absorption of imported technology, in order improve our 
national innovation capability. Leapfrogging in priority fields is to select and concentrate efforts 
in those key areas of relative strength and advantage linked to the national economy and people’s 
livelihood as well as national security, to strive for breakthroughs and realize leaping 
developments. Enabling development is an attempt to strive for breakthroughs in key, enabling 
technologies that are urgently needed for the sustainable and coordinated economic and social 
development. Leading the future reflects a vision in deploying for frontier technologies and basic 
research, which will, in turn, create new market demands and new industries expected to lead the 
future economic growth and social development. The guideline is a summary of China’s practice 
and experience in S&T development for more than a half century, and an important choice for 
realizing the great renaissance of the Chinese nation. 

 

This calls for placing the strengthening of indigenous innovation capability at the core of 
S&T undertakings. The Party and government have long advocated and paid close attention to 
indigenous innovation. To press ahead with the modernization drive under conditions of opening 


to the outside world, we must earnestly study and draw on all the fine achievements of human 
civilization. During the past two decades or so since we began to pursue the policy of reforms and 
opening to the outside world, our country has imported a huge amount of technologies and 
equipment, which played an important role in raising the overall technological level of our 
industries and promoting the country’s economic development. However, one should be clearly 
aware that importation of technology without emphasizing assimilation, absorption, and re-
innovation is bound to weaken the nation’s indigenous R&D capability, which in turn widens the 
gap with world advanced levels. Facts have proved that, in areas critical to the national economy 
and security, core technologies cannot be purchased. If our country wants to take the initiative in 
the fierce international competition, it has to enhance its indigenous innovation capability, master 
core technologies in some critical areas, own proprietary intellectual property rights, and build a 
number of internationally competitive enterprises. In a word, the improvement of indigenous 
innovation capability must be made a national strategy that is implemented in all sectors, industries, 
and regions so as to drastically enhance the nation’s competitiveness. 

 

S&T talents are critical to increasing indigenous innovation capability. The first and foremost 
task is to create a favorite environment for cultivating and attracting S&T personnel, with high-
quality talents in particular, giving full scope to the enthusiasm and creativity of the broad masses 
of S&T personnel, so that a constant stream of talents is ensured and the best of S&T talents is 
brought out. We should make unremitting efforts to build a large, well-structured, high-quality 
S&T workforce compatible with economic and social development and national defense work in 
order to ensure the talents and knowledge base for the nation’s science and technology 
development. 

 

2. Development Goals 


 

The general objectives for the nation’s S&T development (2006-2020) will be to: noticeably 
enhance indigenous innovation capability and S&T level in promoting economic and social 
development and in maintaining national security, in an effort to provide powerful support for the 
building of a well-to-do society; noticeably improve comprehensive strength in basic research and 
frontier technology development; and attain a series of high world impact S&T achievements and 
join the ranks of innovative countries, thus paving the way for becoming a world S&T power by 
mid 21stcentury. 

 

Through efforts over the next 15 years, the nation will meet the following objectives in some 
major scientific and technological areas: 1) mastering core technologies in equipment 
manufacturing and information industry that are critical to the nation’s competitiveness, and 
bringing the technological capability of manufacturing and information industries to the world

mainstream of science development, bringing the technological level in such frontier areas as 
information, biology, materials, and space to world advanced levels; and 8) establishing a number 
of world-class research institutes and universities, and world-competitive industrial R&D centers 
so that a fairly comprehensive national innovation system of Chinese characteristics can take shape. 

 

By 2020, the nation’s gross expenditures on R&D (GERD) are expected to rise to 2.5% or 
above of the gross domestic product(GDP) with the rate of S&T contribution to the economy 
reaching 60% or above, and dependence on imported technology reduced to 30% or below, and

IV. Major Special Projects 

 

Historically, the implementation of major special projects represented by A-bomb, H-bomb, 
satellites, manned space flights, and hybrid rice has played a crucial role in enhancing China’s 
comprehensive strength. The United States, Europe, Japan, Korea, and others have all made the 


implementation of major special projects to meet national goals an important measure in raising 
their national competitiveness. 

In the course of defining priority topics in the main areas, a number of major special projects 
involving strategically important products, critical common technologies, and major engineering 
projects, are identified in line with national objectives. These major special projects are designed 
to strive for breakthroughs, taking full advantage of the socialist system in pooling up resources to 
do big things and the role of the market economy system as well. These major special projects are 
expected to spring from scientific and technological progress in limited areas to a leapfrogging 
development in overall productivity while helping fill up the country’s strategic blanks. The basic 
principles under which major special projects are screened out are as follows: 

 

1) strategic industries that are closely linked to the major demands of the nation’s economic 
and social development, capable of coming up with core proprietary intellectual property rights, 
and having a major impact on indigenous innovative capacity at the enterprise level; 2) key 
enabling technologies that have an overarching bearing on raising the overall industrial 
competitiveness; 3) efforts that are aimed at overcoming major bottlenecks to economic and social 
development; 4) activities that combine both civilian and defense efforts or make defense part of 
the civilian industry and have a major strategic importance to maintaining national security and 
strengthening comprehensive national strength; 5) efforts that are in line with the nation’s 
development status and within the reach of its strength. It is according to the above-mentioned 
principles that a number of major special projects are selected to address a range of issues involving 
high tech industry development, traditional industry transformation, bottlenecks to the nation’s 
economic development, raising people’s health level, and safeguarding national security. These 
major special projects will be implemented upon a further review and approval case by case in 
light of ranking priority of the nation’s development requirement and necessary conditions for 
implementation. 

 

In addition, dynamic readjustment will be made to pace the implementation of these major 
special projects as determined by the nation’s strategic needs and changing situation. For the major 
special projects aiming at strategic products, enterprises are expected to be the principal player in 
terms of research and development and investment. They will start from research on and 
development of major equipment so as to take advantage of allocating S&T resources through 
market mechanism while the starting fund appropriated by the state will be mainly used to address 
key and core technological snags. 

 

Major special projects are major strategic products, critical common technologies, and major 
engineering projects which are selected for realizing national objectives and must be completed 
by massing resources and making breakthroughs in core technologies within a set period of time, 
thus being the top priority in the nation’s science and technology development. The Outline has 
defined 16 major special projects, including core electronic devices, high-end generic chips and 
basic software, super large-scale integrated circuit manufacturing technology and associated 
techniques, the next generation broadband mobile telecommunication, high-end numerically 
controlled machine tools and basic manufacturing technology, the development of large oil-gas

A range of eye catching scientific accomplishments, including animal cloning and stem cells, 
has brought about huge opportunities for the future development of life and medical sciences. 
However, most of these findings remain unready to directly serve humans as a result of lacking a 
systematic and in-depth knowledge of reproduction and development process and associated 
mechanisms. China has a high population growth rate and a high birth defect rate. Confronted with 
a serious shortage of replacement organs, compounded by the coming peak of an aging population, 
the nation is in dire need of breakthroughs and technological innovation in reproduction and 
growth-related theories. 

 

Research will focus on stem cell breeding, isolation, and manipulation; generation, maturity, 
and fertilization of reproductive cells; manipulation mechanism for fetus development; somatic 
dedifferentiation and animal cloning mechanism; degeneration of human reproductive functions 
and regressive mechanism; and safety and ethics of aided reproduction and stem cells technology. 

 

VII. Reform of the S&T System and the Construction of a National Innovation 
System 




 

Since the introduction of the policy of reform and opening up, the nation’s S&T system 
reform has made important breakthroughs and substantial strides as it has strictly positioned 
around forging close links with the economy, aimed at strengthening technological innovation and 
conversion and industrialization of S&T achievements, stressed structural realignment and 
mechanism shift, and adopted a series of major reformative measures. Nevertheless, one has to be 
keenly aware that China’s existing S&T system remains inadequate in meeting the needs of the 
socialist market economy and that of greater economic and S&T development. First, our 
enterprises are yet to become a principal player in technological innovation as their innovative 
capability remains weak. Second, the S&T sector is compartmentalized, resulting in dispersion 
and duplication of efforts and low overall performance level. S&T innovation capability in the 
public good sector is especially weak. Third, S&T management at the macro level is terribly 
uncoordinated, with an S&T resources allocation pattern and evaluation system falling short of 
accommodating the needs for the new S&T development and government mandate shift. Fourth, 
mechanisms for rewarding outstanding personnel and encouraging innovation and pioneering 
activities are not yet consummate. These problems have seriously compromised the nation’s 
innovation capacity building. 


 

Guiding thoughts for deepening the S&T system reform are defined as follows: promoting 
the full-fledged construction of a national innovation system with Chinese characteristics, focusing 
on S&T resources distribution efficiency and comprehensive integration, and effecting a 
breakthrough in building an enterprise-centered technological innovation system featuring the 
integration of industry, academia, and research, so as to greatly advance the construction of a 
uniquely Chinese national innovation system and drastically enhance the nation’s indigenous 
innovation capability. 

 

At present and over a period of time in the future, the S&T system reform will strive to 
accomplish the following major missions: 

 

1. Supporting and Encouraging Enterprises to Become the Main Player in Technological 
Innovation 

 

Market competition is an important driving force behind technological innovation while 
technological innovation is the ultimate route to enhanced enterprise competitiveness. Along with 
deepened reform and opening up, Chinese enterprises are playing an increasingly important role 
in technological innovation. To substantially enhance the motivity and vitality of technological 
innovation at the enterprise level, more agreeable conditions need to be provided, a better 
environment created, and reforms deepened. 

 

Firstly, let economic and S&T policies play a guiding role in order to enable enterprises to 
become the major R&D spender. Efforts must be accelerated to create a unified, open, competitive, 
and orderly environment for the market economy by way of fiscal, taxation, and monetary policies 
so that enterprises, particularly large enterprises, are induced into increasing their R&D spending 
and establishing their own R&D bodies. National engineering laboratories and sectoral 
engineering centers should be established at transformed research institutes or large enterprises 
possessing fairly strong R&D and technology spin-off capabilities, in collaboration with 
universities and research institutes. Encourage technology innovation consortia of various forms 
initiated by enterprises, in collaboration with universities and research institutes, for the purpose 
of technology innovation capacity building. Secondly, reform the modality of S&T programs to 
enable enterprises to undertake national R&D missions. National S&T programs shall reflect more 
of the major industrial needs for science and technology, and attract more enterprises to be part of 
such programs. In the fields of obvious market application prospects, establish an enterprise-led 
mechanism with the involvement of universities and research institutes. Thirdly, perfect the 
technology transfer mechanism to facilitate the integration and application of industrial 
technologies. Establish and perfect intellectual property rights related incentive mechanism, and 
an IPR trading system. Vigorously develop various kinds of S&T intermediary service 
organizations to meet the needs of enterprises, facilitating knowledge flow and technology transfer 
between enterprises, and between enterprises and universities and research institutes. National key 
laboratories and engineering (technology research) centers shall be made more accessible to 
enterprises. Fourthly, accelerate the establishment of a modern enterprise system so as to enhance 
the innate drive for enterprise technology innovation. Technology innovation capacity building 
shall be taken as important indicator in measuring the performance of state-owned enterprises 
while technology factor-based distribution be made an important part of property rights reform 


destined for the high- tech industry. Stick to the direction in which application-oriented R&D 
institutes are transformed into enterprises and deepen the reform of property rights at such 
institutes. This will not only lead to an improved management system and the establishment of a 
rational and effective incentive mechanism, but will also enable the transformed R&D institutes 
to play a major role in high technology industrialization and sectoral technology innovation. 
Fifthly, create a fine innovation environment to spur innovative activities at small- and medium-
sized enterprises(SMEs). As SMEs, particularly technology-based SMEs, are highly innovative 
but frail in risk-taking ventures, a more favorable policy environment should be created for such 
enterprises by drafting and formulating preferential laws and policies, particularly in the context 
of market accessibility and anti-unfair competition. Vigorously develop an S&T investment and 
financing system and a venture capital mechanism and quicken the construction of S&T 
intermediary service bodies, so as serve the needs for technology innovation at SMEs. 

 

3. Deepening Institutional Reform and establishing a Modern Research Institute System 


 

Research institutes engaged in basic research, frontier technology development, and public 
good research constitute a major force in the nation’s S&T innovation activities. Establish a stable, 
high caliber research contingent that serves national objectives and is devoted to S&T undertakings 
is crucial for the future and destiny the nation’s S&T enterprise. Thanks to efforts in restructuring 
and personnel diversion, a number of high quality research institutions have merged, to which 
stable support from the government is critical. While giving ample scope to the important roles 
played by these research institutes, innovation capacity building must be taken as an objective, 
mechanism improvement a focal point, management system reform deepened, so as to accelerate 
the establishment of a modern research institute system under the principle of “clearly defined 
terms of reference, scientific evaluation, orderly open access, and regulated management”. 

 

Firstly, strengthen the capacity building of research institutes in keeping with the terms of 
reference defined by the state. Earnest efforts must be made to address the problem where some 
research institutes suffer from undefined terms of reference, uncoordinated research efforts, and 
weak innovative capability. The allocation of resources should be optimized in order to make 
concerted efforts in creating disciplines and research bases with clear superiority. Public good 
research institutes shall take advantage of technical strength in their respective fields, raising S&T 
innovation and service capability, and addressing major S&T issues in the social development. 
Basic science and frontier technology-oriented research institutes shall take advantage of their 
disciplinary strength in uplifting research levels, striving for theoretical innovation and technology 
breakthroughs, and addressing major S&T issues. Secondly, establishing a stable S&T investment 
mechanism designed to support innovation activities at research institutes. Given the fact that 
disciplinary capacity building and major innovation achievements are the results of tireless efforts 
over a long period of time, state treasury should provide fairly stable appropriation support to 
research institutes engaged in basic research, frontier technology development, and public good 
research. Per capita overhead expenditure level will be raised in line with different types of 
research institutes in support of disciplinary capacity building, basic research activities, and 
cultivation of talented S&T personnel. Thirdly, establish an operational mechanism conducive to 
original innovation at research institutes. Freely selected research topics are extremely crucial for 
raising the original innovation capability and for nurturing high caliber personnel. The support for 
free research topic selection based research should therefore be strengthened. While perfecting the 


system under which the director assumes all power and responsibility at research institutes, 
delegate more autonomous decision-making power to research institutes in S&T expenditure and 
personnel affairs so as to ensure greater capability in coordinating and integrating innovation 
activities at the institute level. Fourthly, work will be carried out to establish a system to assess the 
overall innovation capability of research institutes. Accordingly, a scientific and rational system 
will be established to make an overall assessment of institutional innovation capability in terms of 
the quality of S&T achievements, the buildup of S&T talents, and management/operation 
mechanisms, in order to raise the management level and enhance innovation capability. Fifthly, 
efforts will be made to put in place an effective mechanism for opening up and collaboration. 
Establish a personnel management system featuring the combination of permanent staff and 
temporary or contract personnel by introducing a retainer and vacancy management mechanism 
for full-fledged open recruitment of research and management personnel. For the purpose of 
promoting knowledge flow, personnel mobility, and S&T resource sharing, effective mechanisms 
should be put in place to facilitate various forms of collaboration between research institutes, 
enterprises, and universities. 

 

Universities are not only an important base for nurturing high caliber innovative talents but 
also a principal player in basic research and original technology innovation activities and a 
commendable force in addressing major S&T issues in the national economy, materializing 
technology transfer, and effecting technology spin-off and commercialization. Accelerating the 
establishment of high caliber universities, particularly world-class research universities, is a 
prerequisite for enhancing the nation’s S&T innovation and establishing a national innovation 
system. At present, our country has already built a number of high-caliber universities with 
appropriate scales, comprehensive disciplines, and assembled talents, and these universities should 
be given full scope for their important roles in S&T innovation. 

 

Vigorous support and encouragement need to be provided for university-based original 
innovation in basic research, frontier technology development, and public good 
research. Universities should be encouraged to enter full-fledged cooperation with enterprises and 
research institutes so that they can provide better and more extensive services to economic 
development at the national, regional, and sectoral levels. The capacity building of major academic 
disciplines and S&T innovation platforms at universities will be accelerated in order to nurture 
and assemble a number of world-class academic leaders and build up a faculty contingent with 
high ethical standards, strong innovative spirit, and international competitiveness. Further 
accelerate the reform of university internal management system by optimizing education structure, 
S&T related organizational structure, and innovation mechanism and associated management 
system. Establish a scientific, rational evaluation system and an operational mechanism conducive 
to the nurturing of high quality talents and the improvement of innovative capability, so that every 
talent finds ample scope for his abilities and a constant stream of talents is sustained. Vigorous 
efforts should be made to explore ways and means of building a modern university system with 
Chinese characteristics. 

 

3. Advancing the S&T Management System Reform 

 

In view of the protuberant problems in our country’s S&T management at the macro level, 
the reform of the S&T management system must be advanced, and be centered on improving the 


national S&T decision-making mechanism, overcoming systemic and institutional barriers, 
strengthening inter-ministerial, inter-province, ministry/province, defense/civilian overall 
planning and coordination, so that our ability can be substantially enhanced in mustering S&T 
resources for initiating major S&T undertakings. 

 

Firstly, a national S&T decision-making mechanism should be created and then constantly 
improved. The business discussions procedures for the nation’s major S&T decision-making 
should be improved so that a normative consultation and decision-making mechanism is in place. 
Efforts should be made to expand government roles in overall configuration and macro 
management of S&T development, strengthen coordination in formulating major S&T policies, 
implementing major S&T programs, and in constructing S&T infrastructures. Secondly, establish 
and improve a macro S&T coordination mechanism at the national level. Define the basic status 
of S&T policies as a national public policy and develop an interactive policy coordination system 
between national S&T policies and national economic policies, in response to the objectives of 
promoting S&T innovation and indigenous innovation capability. Create a mechanism to 
coordinate inter-agency allocation of S&T resources. Accelerate government mandate shift at the 
government agencies in charge of S&T management, practice governance according to the law, 
and upgrade the macro management and service level. Ways by which programs are managed must 
be improved to bring into full play the role of government agencies and local authorities in program 
management and project implementation. Thirdly, the S&T review and evaluation system must be 
reformed to reflect principle of fairness, impartiality, openness, and encouraging competition, 
thereby creating conditions for the springing up of various types of talented people, especially the 
young. The review of major projects must be brought in line with national objectives. The peer 
review system should be improved by creating a reviewer credibility system and a review 
mechanism involving international peers, by strengthening the supervision of the review process, 
and by expanding the openness of review activities and ensuring reviewees’ access to appropriate 
information. Special attention and support shall be given to highly innovative small projects, 
uncommon projects, and interdisciplinary projects, with emphasis on the evaluation of quality, 
capability, and research level of individuals or teams, and on whether it is encouraging original 
innovation. Establish an independent review system to evaluate the implementation of major 
national S&T programs, the Knowledge Innovation Program(KIP), and projects funded by the 
National Natural Science Foundation. Fourthly, reform the S&T achievements evaluation and 
award system. Perfect the research assessment and indicator systems in light of different 
characteristics of S&T innovation activities and in accordance with the principle of openness, 
fairness, rule abiding, and streamlined procedures. Avert excessive evaluation or desires for quick 
success and short-term behavior. For innovation activities involving market-oriented applied 
research and experiments, evaluation shall be conducted mainly on the obtaining of proprietary 
intellectual property rights and the contribution to industrial competitiveness. Public good research 
activities shall be evaluated in line with public needs and social benefits derived, while basic 
research and frontier scientific exploration shall be evaluated in line with scientific significance 
and academic value. Establish a personnel assessment system capable of judging personnel 
qualifications in different S&T fields. Reform the national S&T award system by reducing the 
number and levels of awards. Give prominence to government conferred awards by focusing on 
talented individuals while rewarding prize-winning projects. In addition, the creation of non-
governmental awards should be encouraged and regulated. 

 


4. Vigorously Pushing Forward the Construction of a National Innovation System with 
Chinese Characteristics 


 

The objective for deepening S&T system reform is to advance and enhance the construction 
of a national innovation system. The national innovation system is a government-led public system 
which gives full play to the basic role of the market in resource allocation while letting various 
innovation players forge close links and interact with one another. Currently, the construction of 
the national innovation system with Chinese characteristics shall emphasize the following: 

 

Firstly, build an enterprise-led technology innovation system featuring the combination of 
enterprises, universities, and research institutes, which will be a breakthrough point for the full-
fledged construction of the national innovation. Only when such a system is led by enterprises, it 
can ensure the market orientation of technology innovation and effectively combine industry-
university-research strengths for the enhancement of national competitiveness. Only when 
enterprises, universities, and research institutes work together, can S&T resources be efficiently 
allocated, the vitality of research institutes be activated, and enterprises acquire capabilities in 
sustaining innovation. While drastically improving enterprises’ technology innovation capability, 
it is imperative to establish new mechanism allowing research institutes and universities to provide 
services tailored to the needs of enterprises’ technology innovation activities. Secondly, with 
creating an open, mobile, competitive, and collaborative operational mechanism at the core, efforts 
should be made to promote the collaboration and resource sharing between research institutes and 
with universities. Strengthen the construction of public good scientific research system. Develop 
research universities and a number of top-notch, resource sharing basic science and frontier 
technology bases. Thirdly, establish a national defense S&T innovation system highlighting the 
combination of both the defense and civilian needs as well as a civilianized defense industry by 
making defense S&T part of the civilian operations. Promote the close combination of civilian and 
defense S&T findings in a range of areas, including macro management, development strategies 
and planning, R&D activities, and commercial applications of S&T findings. Strengthen the 
development of dual-use technologies, creating an environment where high caliber civilian S&T 
personnel provide services to defense S&T innovation, while defense related S&T achievements 
find quick conversion to civilian applications. Fourthly, establish regional innovation systems with 
diverse characteristics and strengths. Regional innovation system planning and associated 
innovation capacity building shall be made in a unified and coordinated manner, taking into 
account the characteristics and strengths of the regional economic and social development. Deepen 
the reform of the local S&T system, with a view to mustering S&T forces at the central and local 
levels. Take full advantage of the important roles played by universities, research institutes, and 
national high-tech industrial parks in establishing regional innovation systems in order to enhance 
S&T innovation support for the local economic and social development. Reinforce S&T capacity 
building in the country’s central and western regions while earnestly strengthening the 
construction of grassroots S&T systems at the county (city) level. Fifthly, establish a socialized, 
networked S&T intermediary service system. In view of the fact that the S&T intermediary service 
sector is small in size, unitary in function, and weak in providing services, efforts should be made 
to vigorously nurture and develop S&T intermediary service organizations in diverse forms while 
taking full advantage of the important roles played by universities, research institutes, and social 
organizations and groups in providing S&T intermediary services. S&T intermediate service 
organizations should be guided in the direction of professionalism, scale, and standardization. 


 

VIII. Major Policies and Measures 




 

To ensure the implementation of the missions defined in the Outline, efforts should be made 
formulate more effective policies and measures, in addition to addressing system and mechanism 
related issues. All policies and measures shall be made as such that they are conducive to 
enhancing indigenous innovation capability, spurring the enthusiasm and creativity of S&T 
personnel, making full use of S&T resources both at home and abroad, supporting economic and 
social development through science and technology. The S&T policies and measures listed in the 
Outline are designed to address major discrepancies and protuberant problems we are facing today, 
but will be adjusted and perfected in line with changing situations and progress in the 
implementation of the Outline. 

 

1. Financial and Taxation Policies Encouraging Technological Innovation at the 
Enterprise Level 


 

Encourage enterprises to increase R&D spending and strengthen technology innovation 
capability. Accelerate the imposition of a consumption based value added tax, and make the 
industrial payment to equipment procurement favored with a deductible value added tax. On the 
basis of further implementing a range of taxation holiday policies aimed at spurring technology 
innovation and accelerating S&T findings spin-off and equipment upgrading, encourage and 
support enterprises to develop new products, new techniques, and new technologies, by raising the 
level of incentive policies, including pre-tax deduction of enterprise R&D expenditure, in an effort 
to provide taxation holidays for the development of high tech businesses. Along with the reform 
of corporate income tax and corporate financial system, encourage enterprises to establish special 
funds earmarked for R&D activities. Enterprises shall be allowed to accelerate the depreciation 
of the instruments and equipment used in R&D activities. Enact taxation holiday policies for 
procuring advanced scientific instruments and equipment. Enhance foreign exchanges and fund 
raising support for enterprises establishing R&D facilities overseas, and provide convenience and 
quality service for Chinese enterprises’ investment overseas. 

 

Implement the PRC Law on Promoting Small- and Medium-Sized Enterprises, and support 
the establishment of various types of SMEs, in order to take full advantage of their vitality in 
technology innovation. Encourage and support SEM initiated collaborative R&D efforts in the 
form of joint venture or consignment by providing policy support for the commercialization of 
innovation achievements. 

 

2. Strengthening assimilation and absorption of imported technologies, and re-
innovation 


 

Adjust and improve national policies on industrial technology so as to reinforce the 
assimilation and absorption of imported technologies and re-innovation. Policies should be 
developed to encourage indigenous innovation and restrict blind and duplicative technology 
importation. 

 


Readjust the structure and priorities of government appropriations and establish special funds 
that can be used to support assimilation and absorption of imported technologies and re-innovation, 
and support the development of major technologies and equipment and critical common industrial 
technologies. Proactive policies and measures should be formulated increase investments through 
multiple channels in support of enterprise-centered efforts in the assimilation and absorption of 
imported technologies and re-innovation, in collaboration with universities and research institutes. 

 

Major national construction projects should be taken as major carriers of uplifting indigenous 
innovation capability. Through the implementation of major national construction projects, 
assimilate and absorb a series of advanced technologies, master a number of critical technologies 
concerning the nation’s strategic interests, and develop a range of major equipment and key 
products that possess proprietary intellectual property rights. 

 

3. Government Procurement Favoring Indigenous Innovation 


 

Formulate implementing regulations of the “PRC Government Procurement Law” to 
encourage and protect indigenous innovation. Establish a coordination mechanism for government 
procurement of indigenous innovative products. Government practices a first-buy policy for major 
domestically made high-tech equipment and products that possess proprietary intellectual property 
rights. Provide policy support to enterprises in procuring domestic high-tech equipment. Develop 
relevant technology standards through government procurement. 

 

4. Intellectual Property Rights Strategy and Technology Standards Strategy 


 

Protecting intellectual property rights and safeguarding the interests of IPR owners is not 
only necessary for perfecting the nation’s market economy system and promoting indigenous 
innovation, but also important for establishing the nation’s credibility and image in international 
cooperation. It is important to further perfect the nation’s IPR system, and create an agreeable legal 
environment that respects and protects IPR, increase public awareness of IPR, uplift the nation’s 
IPR management level, enhance IPR protection, and crack down on various IPR piracy activities 
according to law. In the meantime, it is necessary to establish a special IPR examination process 
for major economic activities, including mergers and acquisitions and technology trade, in order 
to avoid the loss of proprietary IPR. Prevent the abuse of IPR intended to unfairly restrict market 
competition or obstruct the diffusion and application of innovation and S&T achievements. Make 
IPR management part of the entire S&T management process to raise the nation’s S&T innovation 
level. Reinforce S&T personnel’s IPR awareness while enabling enterprises, research institutes, 
and universities to attach more importance to and strengthen IPR protection. Give ample scope to 
the important role of industrial associations in IPR protection. Establish and perfect a professional 
employment qualification system and public credit system that are conducive to IPR protection. 

 

In line with the nation’s strategic demands and industrial development needs, cultivate a 
number of inventions and creations of major importance to economic, social, and S&T 
development in order to produce indigenous IPR. Organize enterprise-led collaborative efforts 
involving universities and research institutes in overcoming technological snags while providing 
support for patent application, standard formulation, and international trade. 

 


The development of technology standards should be made an important objective of national 
S&T programs. Government agencies concerned and industrial associations shall strengthen 
guidance and coordination for the development of major technology standards, which are to be 
adopted as a priority. Promote the system construction for technology laws and regulations and 
technology standards, and the integration of the development standards with scientific research, 
development, design, and manufacturing, in order to ensure the advanced nature and validity of 
standards. Encourage industry-academia-research collaboration in studying and developing major 
national technology standards, and associated priority adoption. Take an active part in international 
efforts for standards development, and strive to make our country’s technology standards 
international standards. Strengthen the development of system construction for technology trade 
measures. 

 

5. Financial Policies Encouraging Innovation and Pioneering 


 

Establish and perfect venture capital investment mechanism for innovation and pioneering 
activities, and prepare and formulate laws, regulations and policies to promote the healthy 
development of venture capital investment destined for pioneering activities. Advance the 
development of the second board stock exchange, and establish a multi-level capital market system 
that accelerates commercial applications of S&T achievements. Encourage qualified high-tech 
enterprises to be listed on the main and second board stock exchange while creating agreeable 
conditions for small and medium-sized high-tech enterprises to be listed abroad. Create more 
relaxed banking and foreign exchange policy environment for high-tech venture capital firms. 
Carry out experiment on circulating unlisted high-tech corporate real options at national high tech 
industrial parks and gradually establish a technology property rights trade market. Explore to 
establish a fund raising modality guided by state treasury appropriations, and mainstreamed by the 
investment from policy oriented banks and commercial banks, in an attempt to attract more capital 
into venture capital investment market. Establish a nationwide self-regulating organization for 
S&T venture capital investments while encouraging banking institutions to provide favorable loans 
to major national S&T industrialization projects, and S&T commercialization activities. Create 
intellectual property credit and other credit assurance systems, in order to encourage technology 
innovation at small and medium-sized enterprises, and create a healthy fund raising environment 
for them. Establish science and technology related financial cooperation platforms in diverse forms. 
Government shall encourage banking institutions and private capital become part of S&T 
development and to improve and strengthen their services for high-tech enterprises, especially for 
small and medium-sized S&T businesses. Encourage insurance companies to enhance products 
and service innovation so as provide an overall risk guarantee for S&T innovation activities. 

 

6. Accelerating the Industrialization of High Technologies and the Diffusion of 
Advanced Appropriate Technologies 


 

High-tech industrialization shall be deemed as a priority in economic restructuring and 
changing economic growth modalities. Vigorously develop the high-tech industries that can lead 
to breakthroughs in driving economic growth. 

 

Optimize the environment for high-tech industrialization. Efforts should be continued to 
strengthen the capacity building of high-tech industrialization bases, including national high-tech 


industrial parks, by formulating policies conducive not only to the development of national high-
tech industrial parks but also to helping spur the development of adjacent areas. Establish 
information platforms for technology exchange and trade information, and provide policy support 
for technical development and associated service provided by S&T intermediary services, 
including university S&T parks, S&T business incubators, productivity promotion centers, and 
technology transfer centers. 

 

Enhance the support for the diffusion of agricultural technology in order to establish new 
mechanisms for diffusing advanced appropriate technologies to rural areas. The dissemination of 
agricultural S&T achievements should be made an important factor for qualifying for an S&T 
award, while efforts will be made to create a qualification attestation system for agricultural 
technology diffusion personnel, and encouraging S&T personnel to be part of front line diffusion 
efforts in different forms. Establish special funds for agriculture S&T achievements related spin-
off and diffusion, promoting the diffusion of advanced appropriate technologies in rural areas, and 
supporting technology innovation, invention and creation made by rural residents. The state shall 
provide a classified guidance and support for the diffusion of agricultural S&T findings, 
encouraging and supporting the development of diffusion organizations in different forms, and 
created diversified diffusion systems. 

 

Support industrial sector-oriented applications of critical enabling technologies . Effective 
policies and measures will be worked out to support the development, diffusion, and application 
of pre-competitive industrial technologies, particularly the diffusion and application of key 
technologies in the fields of electronics and information, biology, information technology-based 
manufacturing, advanced materials, environmental protection, and energy efficiency. Promote the 
transformation and upgrading of traditional industries, and strengthen the capacity building of 
technology engineering platforms, industrialization demonstration bases, and intermediate pilot 
bases. 

 

7. Perfecting the Mechanism for Combining Defense and Civilian Sectors, and Making 
Defense Part of the Civilian Sector 


 

Strengthen the overall planning and coordination in integrating the defense and civilian 
sectors. The S&T management system that separates the defense from the civilian must be 
reformed to allow for the creation of a new S&T management system embracing both the defense 
and civic sectors. Encourage defense-related research institutes to work on civilian research topics, 
while defense-related R&D activities be made open to civilian research institutes and 
industries. Expand the scope of defense procurement from civilian research institutes and 
industries. Reform the management system to ensure fair competition between non-defense and 
defense research institutes for defense-related research and production contracts while establishing 
public platforms for the integration of the defense and civilian sectors, and for dual-use 
applications. 

 

Establish a new mechanism adapting to the characteristics of both defense and civic scientific 
research activities. Coordinate the deployment of basic research in defense and civilian sectors, 
and strengthen the integration of research and development efforts in both sectors. Establish an 
interactive mechanism between the defense and civic sectors, coordinating the development and 


production of defense and civilian products, and fostering an organic combination of S&T efforts 
in both sectors. 

 

8. Expanding International and Regional S&T Cooperation and Exchanges 


 

The improvement of the nation’s indigenous innovative capability calls for taking full 
advantage of the merits derived from opening to the outside world, and a significantly higher level 
of international and regional S&T cooperation and exchanges in various forms. 

 

Encouraging research institutes and universities to establish joint laboratories or R&D 
centers with overseas research institutes; support the implementation of international cooperation 
projects under bilateral or multilateral S&T cooperation frameworks; and establish a collaborating 
S&T mechanism between the mainland and Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan, to strengthen 
communications and exchanges. 

 

Support our country’s enterprises in their “going out” efforts. Expand the export of high 
technologies and products, encouraging and helping them to establish R&D centers or 
industrialization bases overseas. 

 

Participate actively in large international scientific projects and international academic 
organizations. Supporting our scientists and research institutes to be part of or take the lead in large 
international and regional scientific projects. A training system should be established in order to 
increase the ability of our scientists to engage in international academic exchanges and to take up 
senior positions at major international academic organizations. Encourage multinational 
corporations to establish their R&D centers in our country while offering favorable conditions for 
making our country the physical location of international academic organizations or their regional 
offices. 

 

9. Improving Scientific and Cultural Literacy of the Entire Nation and Building a Social 
Environment Conducive to S&T innovation 


 

Implement a nationwide scientific literacy action plan. Improve the scientific and cultural 
literacy of the entire nation with a view to advancing people’s overall development. Advocate 
scientific spirit, spread scientific thinking and practices, and diffuse scientific knowledge. 
Strengthen popular science activities in rural areas, gradually establishing a training system that 
helps raise farmers’ farming technologies and vocational skills. Organize systematic scientific 
exploration and experiencing activities in different forms both on and off campus. Strengthen 
innovation oriented education, and raising teenagers’ innovation awareness and capability. 
Strengthen science and technology related training for public servants at different levels. 

 

Strengthen the national capacity building in the field of popular science by rationally 
distributing and building popular science facilities and improving the quality of existing popular 
science sites. Establish a system making research institutes and universities accessible to the 
public on a regular basis, while strengthening communications and exchanges with the public 
through the implementation of S&T programs and projects. In order to bring about a flourishing 
development in popular science writings and creating popular science brand names, encourage 


renowned scientists and other experts and scholars to become involved in popular science writings, 
developing major popular science topics, and fostering original popular science writings. Establish 
S&T communications as a major at universities, in order to strengthen basic theoretical studies 
concerning popular science and train popular science professionals. 

 

Establish a sound operational mechanism for popular science activities. Strengthen concerted 
efforts of government agencies, private groups, and large enterprises, facilitating interaction and 
collaboration between the S&T and education communities and the mass media. Encourage the 
development of business oriented popular science activities by relaxing restrictions to allow 
private and overseas capital to access popular science activities and by formulating preferential 
policies for establishing diversified investment mechanisms. Advance the reform of public good 
popular science system in order to activate vitality, increase service conscientiousness, and 
enhance sustainable development capability. 

 

IX. S&T Input and S&T Infrastructure Platforms 




 

S&T input and basic facilities platforms constitute a material basis for S&T innovation, and 
an important prerequisite and a fundamental guarantee for sustainable S&T development. Today’s 
S&T input is literally an investment in the future national competitiveness. Since the adoption of 
reform and opening up policy, the nation has seen continued increases in S&T input. However, to 
meet the major demand in greater S&T development and in the full-fledged construction a well-
to-do society, and compared with the developed and emerging industrialized nations, the nation’s 
total and intensity of S&T input remains insufficient, with irrational aspects in the investment 
structure, and a weak S&T infrastructure. Given the fact that both developed and emerging 
industrialized nations around the world have made the increase of S&T input a strategic measure 
to raise their national competitiveness, our country should respond to the trend and need for 
enhancing the nation’s indigenous innovation and core competitiveness by drastically increasing 
its input in S&T activities and strengthening the construction basic S&T facilities, so as to ensure 
the fulfillment of the missions defined in the Outline. 

 

1. Establishing a Diversified, Multi-channel S&T Input System 


 

Taking full advantage of the guiding role played by the government in enhancing S&T input, 
efforts are to be made to enhance government capability in mobilizing nationwide S&T resources 
through diverse financial means such as direct appropriations and referential taxation breaks. State 
treasury appropriations will be mainly used to support public S&T activities that cannot be 
effectively covered by the current market system, including basic research, frontier technology 
development, public good research, and development of major key enabling technologies, in 
addition to its role in guiding industry and private sectors to enhance their S&T input. Government 
agencies at both central and local levels shall increase the proportion of S&T input in both annual 
budgeting and distribution of extra budgets, according to the PRC Law on S&T Progress, in an 
attempt to ensure an S&T expenditure growth noticeably higher than that of regular financial 
revenues, and in an effort to gradually raise the weight of state treasury S&T appropriations in 
GDP. Coordinate expenditure needs for implementing planned S&T activities in line with the 
national strength, to ensure the smooth implementation of major special projects. The central 
government will continue to increase its investment in the construction of major S&T 


infrastructure, with a weighted appropriation support for construction activities at both central and 
local levels. While increasing government appropriated S&T input, efforts should be made to 
strengthen the principal position of enterprises in S&T input. In a word, these concerted efforts of 
all sectors are expected to bring about an increased R&D expenditure year by year, which will 
reach 2% by 2010 and 2.5% or above by 2020 as a percentage of GDP. 

 

2. Readjusting and Optimizing Input Structures, and Raising the Cost-effectiveness of 
S&T Expenditures 


 

Support will be strengthened for basic research, frontier technology development, public 
good research, S&T infrastructure, and popular science activities. Make appropriate funds 
available for regular expenditures needed by research institutes (bases), research projects, and S&T 
infrastructure construction. Steadily enhancing the investment in basic research and public good 
oriented research institutes, making popular science expenditures part of the financial budgeting 
at an equivalent level, and gradually raising the input in popular science activities. Establish and 
perfect an S&T expenditure management system, in line with the rules of scientific research and 
characteristics of S&T activities. Regulate the use of S&T appropriations in accordance with 
relevant state regulations on budgeting, and improve the safety and effectiveness of appropriations. 
Increase the openness, transparency, and fairness of national S&T program management, gradually 
establishing an S&T expenditure assessment system, and corresponding evaluation and 
supervision mechanism. 

 

3. Strengthening the Construction of S&T Infrastructure Platforms 


 

S&T infrastructures platforms are an enabling system consisting of research and experiment 
bases, large scientific facilities, instrumentation, and equipment, scientific data and information, 
and natural S&T resources, supported by information and network technologies and shared by the 
public in their innovation activities. The construction of S&T infrastructure platforms will focus 
on the following: 

 

National research and experiment bases. Establish, in line with the nation’s major strategic 
needs, a number of national laboratories and scientific research and experiment bases, featuring a 
strong interdisciplinary research team and advanced level, in emerging fields or in the fields where 
China has a specialty or strength. Strengthen the capacity building of national key labs, and 
consistently raise its operation and management capability. Establish a national network for field 
scientific observation and research activities. 

 

Large scientific projects and facilities. Pay more attention to the role played by scientific 
instruments and equipment in scientific research, and strengthen the proprietary research and 
development of scientific instruments and equipment and associated test techniques. Establish a 
number of large scientific projects and infrastructures, including high performance computers, 
large aerodynamic research and experiment, and scientific experiments under extreme conditions. 
Advance sharing and construction of large scientific instruments, equipment , and facilities, 
gradually forming up a nationwide sharing network. 

 


Scientific data and information platforms. Establish digital platforms ridden with S&T 
conditions and resources related information, by taking full advantage of modern information 
technology and means, facilitating sharing of scientific data and literatures, building an online 
scientific research environment, providing relevant services to the whole society, and promoting 
the reform of means and approaches used in scientific research. 

 

Natural S&T resources service platforms. Establish a complete conservation system for plant 
and animal germplasm, microbes and bacteria species resources, and human genetic resources, and 
create a protection and utilization system for natural S&T resources, including experimental 
materials, specimens, and mineral fossils. 

 

National technical system for standards, metrology, and test. Develop and formulate high 
accuracy and high-stability metrological bench standards and standard specimen system. Establish 
technology standards for major fields, and improve test lab systems, attestation and certification 
systems, and associated technical measures for technology trade. 

 

4. Establishing a Mechanism for Sharing S&T infrastructure Platforms 


 

The establishment of an effective sharing system and mechanism constitute a key link and 
prerequisite for the development of S&T infrastructure platforms. Under the principle of 
“consolidating, sharing, perfecting, and upgrading”, and taking into account successful foreign 
experience, formulate standards and regulations involving different S&T resources, and establish 
a policy and law system promoting S&T resources sharing. Encourag flexible sharing modalities 
in line with different S&T resources and conditions, and break up the existing divided, closed, and 
redundant pattern. 

 

X. Talented Workforce Buildup 




 

S&T innovation is rooted in S&T personnel. Human resource has become a most important 
strategic resource. It is important to advocate the strategy of national capacity building with 
talented people, strengthening the capacity building of S&T personnel, and providing human 
resource support for the implementation of the Outline.
