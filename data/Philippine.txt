Philippine National Cyber Security Plan 2005   
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY  
  
  
The initiative to formulate a National Cyber Security Plan is part and parcel of the current national  
effort to address critical infrastructure protection concerns. It forms part of the National Critical  
Infrastructure Protection Plan (NCIPP) which outlines the strategies and programs to be pursued in  
protecting the nation’s critical infrastructures.   
  
This Plan addresses the cyber aspect of critical infrastructure protection. While it focuses on the  
nature and characteristics of information and communication technology it takes into account  
important physical aspects and dimensions of critical infrastructure protection to achieve more  
effective measures to respond to the challenges of cyber threats.  
  
In formulating this Plan, it was deemed necessary to determine the nature and characteristics of the  
Philippine Cyberspace. Here, it is defined as the total apparatus (elements and systems) that  
enables people and network/computer systems to communicate with each other. It is the space  
where information is posted, exploited, manipulated, traded, accessed and created by the  
interaction, communication and collaboration of people and organizations via the network of  
information and communication system infrastructures.  
  
The components of the Philippine Cyberspace include (1) Enterprise Networks/ Intranets, (2) Local  
Internet Service Provider (ISP), (3) Regional Network Providers (RNP), (4) Internet Backbone, (5)  
User Services, (6) Online Content, (7) Source of Online Content, (8) End-Users, and (9)  
Telecommunication Services.  
The cyberspace continues to face a myriad of challenges. These challenges include threats in the  
form of events, situations and conditions that tend to disrupt, degrade and destroy cyber  
infrastructures. Generally, threats originate either from accidental and deliberate sources such as (1)  
accidents and malfunctions, (2) hacktivism, (3) cyberterrorism, (4) information warfare, (5) foreign  
intelligence, (6) technoterrorism, and (7) cybercrimes.  
  
This plan is also consistent with our existing international commitment with the United Nations,  
APEC and the ASEAN where each member state or economy agreed to jumpstart collective efforts  
to secure the cyberspace against terrorism.   
  
The primary goals of this Plan include: (1) assuring the continuous operation of our nation’s critical  
cyber infrastructures, (2) implementing capacity-building measures to enhance our ability to respond  
to threats before, during and after attacks, (3) effective law enforcement and administration of  
justice, and (4) a cyber security-conscious society.  
  
There are four (4) strategies identified which are necessary to protect critical cyber infrastructures  
namely: (1) Understanding the Risk, (2) Controlling the Risk, (3) Organizing and Mobilizing for  
Cybersecurity, and (4) Institutional and Policy Build-Up. Each strategy has specific programs to be  
implemented.  
  
In general, this Plan seeks to institutionalize the necessary capabilities in the government and in the  
private sector to adequately meet and respond to challenges and threats against cyber  
infrastructures that are critical to the national way of life and well-being.   
  
Protecting the future is the primary responsibility of each and every Filipino today. If the Philippines  
intends to join the ranks of nations that have become information-based societies, security of the of  
the nation’s digital infrastructures cyberspace must be pursued with urgency. It should be made a  
vital component of the over-all strategic, operational and tactical priorities of our national security

strategy   
.  
  
INTRODUCTION  
  
  
Consistent with the President’s agenda of national development through the utilization and  
development of information and communication technology, is the protection of digital infrastructures  
which should be pursued urgently. The importance of information and communications technology  
(ICT) is underwritten in the fact that it has been identified as the "foundation of the Philippine’s future  
economic development."   
  
ICT has become an integral component in the operation and management of the economy and  
government. ICT is important to our nation’s capacity to carry out information-based public and  
private enterprises. Most of these information-based enterprises like those telecommunication  
companies, banks, transportation and government agencies among others are considered as critical  
infrastructures. The importance of ICT is also underscored by the fact that mutual dependencies and  
interconnectedness among the various critical infrastructures are enabled through ICT, or  
sometimes referred to as digital or cyber infrastructures.   
  
Digital infrastructures are the platforms through which the Philippine cyberspace spans. It is utilized  
by economic enterprises to improve productivity, hasten delivery of products and services, and  
increase competitiveness. They are also used extensively not only to facilitate the exchange and  
delivery of information such as those spanning a wide range of resources for research, education,  
entertainment, etc., but also those that involve crucial public services and government functions.  
  
Our dependence on ICT, however, has opened up vulnerabilities that can be exploited by criminals  
and terrorist organizations and other forms of malicious exploitations and lawless activities. The  
successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can cause tremendous damages and major  
disruptions to the normal operation of the economy and government, thereby posing serious  
implications to national security and to the welfare of our people.  
  
While ICT provides opportunities for national development, it also brought along new kinds of threats  
that challenge national interest and security. ICT has also become a weapon or new ways and  
means to wage wars and perpetrate crimes and terrorism.  
  
This plan is a response to these challenges. It shall be called the National Cyber Security Plan  
(NCSP), and will form part of the National Critical Infrastructure Protection Plan (NCIPP) to protect  
our critical cyber or digital infrastructures, referred to in this volume as the cyber aspect of critical  
infrastructure protection. It will serve as the guide upon which our actions will be based to help  
assure the resiliency of our critical infrastructures.   
  
While it can stand as a separate program, the NCSP shall support and enhance the physical aspect  
of critical infrastructure protection. It will address the information and communication technology  
security or cyber security requirements of critical infrastructures.  
  
The NCSP outlines the strategies and programs necessary to protect the nation’s critical cyber  
infrastructures. It highlights the necessary and specific cyber security measures in accordance with  
the strategies, guiding principles and basic framework set and defined in the NCIPP.   
  
As recognized in the NCIPP, the protection of critical cyber infrastructures necessitates the need to  
implement the concept of “shared responsibility” that requires coordination, cooperation and  
collaboration between the private and the public sectors. Nonetheless, it still falls to the government  

----------------------- Page 3-----------------------

the primary task of creating a conducive environment for the protection of critical cyber  
infrastructures.  
  
PART ONE - DEFINING THE CYBERSPACE  
The formulation of plans and strategies to secure the cyberspace is hinged upon the proper  
understanding of the nature and characteristics of our cyber or digital infrastructures. Thus, this  
section shall provide an brief description and importance of the cyberspace.   
  
  
I. THE PHILIPPINE CYBERSPACE  
  
  
At present, the term cyberspace is conventionally described as “the non-physical terrain created by  
computer systems.” In technical terms, cyberspace consists of computer networks as well as the  
worldwide network of computer networks that use the Transmission Control/Internet network  
protocols to facilitate data transmission and exchange. Cyberspace is differentiated from physical  
space such that the latter refers to an aspect of reality visible to the naked eye, while the former  
refers to an ethereal reality in which information in the form of communicated messages coexist and  
are transmitted. Cyberspace, therefore, should not be confused as being imaginary; it is real and  
exhibit physical reality through servers, routers, cables, switches, computers and electronic  
messages.   
  
For the purposes of this Plan, cyberspace is the consequence of the operation of the total apparatus  
(elements and systems) that enables people and network/computer systems to communicate with  
each other. These apparatus are called information and communication system infrastructures.  
Hence, the protection of cyberspace requires securing this “total apparatus”.   
  
Cyberspace resides in the information and communication system infrastructures of Internet Service  
Providers (ISPs), gateways, independent networks of corporations, and telecommunication  
companies represented by domain names, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses, MAC addresses, e-mail  
addresses and telephone numbers. These stress the inextricable importance of the physical  
components (hardware) in the protection of the Philippine Cyberspace.  
  
  
The Philippine Cyberspace is therefore the space where information is posted, exploited,  
manipulated, traded and accessed, created by the interaction, communication and collaboration of  
people and organizations via the network of information and communication system infrastructures.  
It is a consequence of the use of these networks of physical infrastructures. Today, they are now  
called digital or cyber infrastructures.  
  
  
II. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE DIGITAL INFRASTRUCTURES  
  
Digital infrastructures are the platforms to the Philippine Cyberspace which are critical for key social,  
political, military and economic functions such as the managing, and operating of the country’s  
power plants and dams, the electric power grid, the transportation and air traffic control systems  
including financial institutions. They are also vital in the day-to-day operations of business,  
government and non-government institutions. Business establishments, large and small, rely on  
them to manage communication and payroll, track inventory and sales, as well as perform research  
and development functions, generate food production and many others. Digital infrastructures are  
keys to our nation’s capacity to carry out information-based public and private enterprises. Most of  
these information-based enterprises are considered critical infrastructures vital to the operation of  
the government and the economy.  

----------------------- Page 4-----------------------

  
Critical infrastructures have been revolutionized by advances in information technology in the form of  
digital infrastructures. Taking advantage of the speed, efficiency and effectiveness of computers and  
digital communications, all critical infrastructures are now increasingly being connected and  
interdependent.  
Over the years, the reliance of critical infrastructures on digital infrastructures has tremendously  
increased to cope with the demand for better business processes and competitiveness aside from  
better public service and national security. Today, digital infrastructures are crucial for banking, local  
and international communication services, generation and distribution of water and power,  
production and distribution of good and services, transportation and travel, entertainment, security,  
education and many other applications that have changed the way we do things as individuals or  
organizations. With the rapid increase of digital infrastructures, they are now considered as strategic  
resources and assets that play an important role in the nation’s economic development and  
competitiveness, security and well-being. Their disruption or destruction will have debilitating  
impacts to national security.  
  
  
III. COMPONENTS OF THE PHILIPPINE CYBERSPACE  
  
Basically, the components of the country’s cyberspace are those digital infrastructures that  
interconnect national, regional and global information and communications networks. These  
components are identified as follows:  
  
1. Enterprise Networks/ Intranets   
  
Enterprise Networks or intranets pertain to independent networks, local area networks (LAN) and  
wide area networks (WAN) that are connected through the telecommunication channels. Said  
networks cater to their organization’s business applications, critical infrastructures included.  
  
2. Local Internet Service Provider   
(ISP)  
  
These are organizations that provide gateways between packet-switching networks and Public  
Switching Telephone Networks (PSTN). These are networks through which most customers gain  
access to the Internet using telephone lines. They are sometimes referred to as second level ISP’s.  
Examples of these are Infocom, Mozcom and Pacific Internet.  
  
3. Regional Network Providers (RNP)  
  
These entities provide WANs across large geographic areas. They function as client/server systems  
integrator, value-added reseller, and/or provider of Internet services to a wide geographic market.   
  
4. Internet Backbone  
  
Composed of organizations that provide major interconnection between different networks, they  
consist of:  
  
 Network Service Providers (NSP) – These are organizations that provide the foundation of the  
Internet backbone, which is largely based upon the architecture of the Internet’s precursors.  
Considered as peering centers, NSP offers national and international interconnecting Internet  
services to wholesale level RNPs and large ISP’s through so-called priority Network Access Points  
(NAP).  
  

----------------------- Page 5-----------------------

 Network Access Points (NAP) – Network Access Points offer a mechanism for NSPs and ISPs to  
interconnect. Collectively, they operate as the Public Internet Backbone that connects to ISPs, POP  
and hosts.  
  
 Long Distance Carriers – They supply a national network of communication channels for the  
Internet and long distance voice and data communications. In general, the NAPs contract the long  
distance carriers for the channels needed for their backbone.  
  
5. User Services   
  
These are organizations that provide domain names, email hosting, newsgroups, telnet, FTP, and  
storage.  
  
6. Online Content   
  
These are information resources that are published in websites and stored in databases of ISP’s and  
and organizations that own them..   
  
7. Source of Online Content   
  
Sources of Online content are materials where information or data are generated and transformed  
into digital form. They include books, files, pictures, recordings, video financial data and etc.  
  
8. End-Users   
  
End-users pertain to people and organizations that utilize the network for their personal and  
business purposes.  
  
9. Telecommunication Services  
  
These are comprised of the facilities that provide connection of communication channels to ISP’s,  
independent networks, and individual subscribers and users.  
  
  
PART TWO:  
CHALLENGES IN CRITICAL CYBER INFRASTRUCTURE PROTECTION  
  
The Philippine cyberspace is challenged by a myriad of threats each day. These challenges, both  
actual and potential, brought unprecedented reshaping to our national security preparations and  
requirements. Enhancing our country’s ability to understand and recognize these challenges is  
necessary in order to adequately manage the growing threats to our critical infrastructure  
  
I. CATEGORIES OF CYBER THREATS  
  
Cyber threats are events, situations and conditions that tend to reduce, disrupt, degrade and destroy  
digital infrastructures. Generally, threats originate either from accidental and deliberate sources.  
  
In general, accidental causes are natural (e.g., a lightning surge that destroys a power supply in a  
network that causes part of the network to fail) or human but non-deliberate (e.g., faulty design,  
usage of infested media or accidental cutting of data cables). Accidental causes may also be  
attributed to situations that directly relate to safety, reliability and trustworthiness.   
  
Deliberate problems are the result of conscious human behaviour. In dealing with deliberate  

----------------------- Page 6-----------------------

problems, one is faced with malicious intent. A malicious human may seek to hide his or her tracks,  
making it difficult to identify the nature of the problem caused (or even to identify that a problem has  
been caused). A malicious human can, in principle, tailor actions to produce a desired effect beyond  
the damage to the actual system attacked -- unlike an accidental problem whose effects are  
randomly determined.   
  
There are seven (7) more specific categories of threats to the cyberspace. These are accidents and  
malfunctions, hacktivism, cybercrimes, techno-terrorism, cyberterrorism, foreign intelligence and  
information warfare.   
  
1. Accidents and Malfunctions  
  
This category includes operator error, hardware malfunctions, software bugs, data errors, damage to  
physical facilities, inadequate system performance and system malfunctions. An example of this is  
the famous Y2K or millennium bug. Occurrences of these threats are attributed to disaster,  
calamities, and lack of knowledge, as well as lack of maintenance, factory defects and faulty  
designs.   
  
2. Hacktivism  
Considered as the marriage of hacking with activism, it covers operations that use hacking  
techniques against a target Internet site with the intent of disrupting normal operations but without  
causing serious damage. It also includes electronic civil disobedience, which brings methods of civil  
disobedience to cyberspace like virtual sit-ins and blockades, automated e-mail bombs, web hacks  
and computer break-ins including the use of malicious codes.  
  
3. Cyberterrorism  
  
The exploitation of digital infrastructures for terrorist ends, it comprises of politically-motivated  
hacking operations designed to cause grave harm such as loss of life or severe economic damage.  
An example would be an intrusion into an air traffic control system and causing two planes to collide.  
4. Technoterrorism   
  
This is the intermediate step between "conventional" terrorism and "cyberterrorism." Unlike the  
cyberterrorist, the technoterrorist will attack those systems that exist in the physical world to disrupt  
cyberspace. Thus, the computer itself (hardware rather than software) is the target of the  
technoterrorist. The technoterrorist will use "conventional" weapons such as bombs and physical  
destruction to disable or destroy digital infrastructures.  
  
5. Information Warfare  
  
Defined as being concerned “with the defensive and offensive use of information and information  
systems to exploit, corrupt, or destroy an adversary’s information and information system while  
protecting one’s own.”47 Winn Schwartau, a pioneer on the topic of information warfare has  
developed three classes: personal information warfare which is characterized by the electronic  
attack against an individual’s privacy; corporate information warfare where corporations use  
information and its associated technology to destroy or win against their competitors; and, global  
information warfare which targets entire industries, nations and global economic forces.   
  
6. Foreign Intelligence  
  
The cyberspace is a potentially lucrative source of strategic and competitive intelligence that can be  
collected by intelligence agencies of governments and their military and police organizations.  
Intelligence that can be collected in the cyberspace include reports on current events, analytic  

----------------------- Page 7-----------------------

political and economic assessments and plans, as well as programs and operations of government,  
political organizations, non-government organizations/people’s organizations (NGOs/POs) and  
business organizations. It encompasses monitoring, eavesdropping and interception of  
communications or electronic messages.  
  
7. Cyber Crimes  
  
Synonymously referred to as computer crimes, they are characterized by hacking or unauthorized  
access to computer systems or networks, or forcibly taking over a computer network to destroy  
and/or modify data and programs including stealing information that can cause disruption to the  
network. Reasons may vary from personal gains to political reasons. Cyber crimes include theft,  
sabotage, vandalism, cyberstalking, child pornography, copyright violations, piracy, trademark  
counterfeiting, Internet fraud and others.  
  
Likewise, acts which disrupt or interfere with the normal conduct of transactions over the cyberspace  
are regarded as cyber crimes. According to the Tenth United Nations Congress on the Prevention of  
Crime and the Treatment of Offenders, in Vienna on April 10-17 2000, Cyber crime is defined as  
“any crime capable of being committed in an electronic environment, where crime refers to behavior  
generally defined as illegal or likely to be criminalized.” Specific cyber crimes have already been  
identified by the international community as well as the Philippine legislative body, and will be  
elaborated in the latter parts of this section.  
  
II. TOOLS FOR CYBER ATTACKS  
  
In carrying out these threats, several tools and weapons are used by perpetrators of cyber attacks.  
The following are some of the most commonly known tools:  
  
  
1. Back Door / Trap Door   
  
This is a set of instructions that permits an unauthorized or authorized user to bypass the system’s  
security measures (usually a network firewall), usually referred to as backdoor entrances.   
These program codes are placed by developers and vendors to make it easier for them to modify or  
repair system parameters. Because they are usually compromised, they are used as entry points for  
hacking. These can also be program codes that have been planted by an attacker into a computer  
system’s firewall in the form of a trojan horse. The Trojan horse acts as a slave waiting for a  
command to be executed and controlled remotely by a master (usually the attacker).   
  
  
2. Trojan Horses  
  
These are programs that appear to be valid and useful but usually contain hidden instructions that  
can cause damage to the system. A destructive software that disguises itself as a benign  
application, they are usually utilized in order to place a backdoor/trap door into a compromised  
system.  
  
3. Virus  
  
This is a special type of Trojan horse that can replicate itself and spread, just like a biological virus,  
causing damage to a computer system or network. Depending on the author’s motive, a program  
infected with virus may cause damage immediately upon execution, or it may wait until a certain  
event has occurred, such as a particular date, time or command. It should be noted that computer  
virus infection is increasing by 47% per year perpetrated by hackers who maintain 30,000 hacker- 

----------------------- Page 8-----------------------

oriented sites on the Internet.  
  
4. Logic Bomb   
  
This is a type of Trojan horse whose destructive actions are set to occur when a particular condition  
occurs, such as reaching a particular clock-time of the initiation of a particular program. Logic bombs  
are sometimes used for computerized vandalism and revenge. They are designed to go off long after  
the programmer has left the organization.  
  
  
5. Worm   
  
A worm is a program that replicates itself via a permanent or dial-up network connection. Unlike a  
virus, which seeds itself within the computer’s hard disk for file system, a worm is a self-supporting  
program. It can also be used to spread time bombs, viruses Trojan horses and etc.   
  
6. Packet Storming   
  
This is a form of attack that involves the flooding of ports with large number of packets with the intent  
to deny service to the network. It can be repeated in rapid fire succession generating enough traffic  
to shut major networks. This is sometimes called the “smurf attack”.  
  
7. E-mail Bombs   
  
More commonly known as email spamming, this is the bombardment of email accounts with  
thousands of messages, distributed with the aid of an automated tool, causing a recipient’s incoming  
email box to jam.  
  
8. Packet Sniffing  
  
These are program utilities that easily permit unauthorized persons to capture packet data and  
examine this data. Sniffers monitor network data and can be a self-contained software program of  
hardware devices which usually act as network probes or “snoops” examining network traffic but  
without intercepting or altering it.  
  
The two kinds of packet sniffing are PASSIVE and ACTIVE. Passive sniffing is usually done in a  
local area network environment within the same subnet while ACTIVE sniffing is done in a larger- 
scale environment, usually over a routed wide-area network.  
  
9. Software Robots   
  
These are programs that automatically traverse the web’s hypertext structure designed to retrieve  
documents from a site, and reference all documents in a recursive manner. Sometimes called web  
wanderers, crawlers or spiders,   
  
software robots are usually used to carry out search tasks but they can also be designed to steal  
information, destroy data, violate copyright or strain resources on another site and also overload  
networks and servers.  
10. Chipping  
  
This pertains to the installation of microchips in the production of integrated circuits by  
manufacturers that can be used for sabotage, by serving as control and locator for some future  
undertaking.  

----------------------- Page 9-----------------------

  
11. Nano-Machines and Microbes  
  
These are tiny robots that are smaller than ants and are used to attack computer hardware by  
crawling and entering computers through slots and shutting down electronic circuits. A special breed  
of microbes can also be used to destroy integrated circuits.  
  
12. Electronic Jamming   
  
This is the deliberate radiation, re-radiation and reflection of electromagnetic energy for the purpose  
of disrupting or prevent the use of electronic devices, equipment, or systems.  
  
13. High Energy Radio Frequency (HERF) Guns–EMP Bombs   
  
HERF guns are radio transmitters that can shoot a high-power radio signal at an electronic target to  
disable it. EMP bombs are weapons that use electromagnetic pulse that can be detonated near  
electronic devices. It can destroy all computer and communication systems in a large area.  
  
  
14. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS)   
  
DDoS attacks employ armies of "zombie" machines that are controlled by a single master server.  
These machines will then inundate a target server with thousands of packets of data, in an attempt  
to overwhelm the server and cause it to crash.  
DDoS attacks have always been a tool of choice for attackers in taking down entire networks.   
  
15. Steganography   
Steganography is simply taking one piece of information and hiding it within another picture or  
document. Computer files such as images, sound recordings, and disks contain unused or  
insignificant areas of data. Steganography takes advantage of these areas, replacing them with  
information like encrypted mail, for instance.  
  
Cyber terrorists can use information-hiding to assist them in their plot to destroy infrastructures and  
cause damage to key government sites and services. These attackers can embed full messages and  
communications inside pictures that people would never suspect. Information-hiding can also be  
used for hiding Trojans, spreading viruses, concealing backdoors, hiding destructive wiping  
programs, imbedding links, and passing secret information.   
  
  
III. MODES OF OPERATION   
  
  
The usual modes of operations are the following:  
  
• Hacking is defined as the unauthorized access to a computer system to gain knowledge about a  
particular computer system and how it operates.   
  
• Cracking, on the other hand, is the unauthorized access to computer systems to sabotage, steal  
information, and modify data or congest information traffic into the computer network for personal or  
political gains.   
  
• Phreaking is the unauthorized entry to or hacking of a telecommunication system in order to gain  
access to a telephone line or make free calls. It is also a means to gain control of a phone switch in  

----------------------- Page 10-----------------------

order to add additional phone lines and modify billing information.  
  
  
IV. POTENTIAL THREAT SOURCES  
  
Threats to critical cyber infrastructure will increase as development of these infrastructures also  
progresses. These threats may come from a variety of sources which may be either internal or  
external to the cyber infrastructure per se.   
  
Threat sources include, among others:  
  
• Nations (hostile or non-hostile) - for economic, political and security reasons  
• Foreign Intelligence Service – for information superiority through collection of strategic intelligence  
and information warfare  
• Business Competitors – for competitive advantage through industrial espionage and competitive  
intelligence   
• Terrorist Organizations – for disruption and destruction through cyber terrorism among others.  
• Organized Crime Groups – for personal and organizational gain through all forms of cyber crimes  
• Insiders – for revenge or economic gain through sabotage and theft  
  
  
V. VIEW OF THE THREAT   
  
  
Threats to critical cyber infrastructure will rapidly increase in terms of frequency and lethality as  
development and use of these infrastructures also increases. The US Department of Defense came  
up with a projection on how these threats will be in the future as shown in the table below:

VI. MOTIVATIONS  
  
  
Threat sources likewise have diverse individual and collective motivations or intentions. While some  
perpetrators do not intend to cause large-scale damage to cyber infrastructures, many do engage in  
these activities to realize political and economic ends such as achieving competitive advantage,  
instituting revenge, deliberately invading privacy, spreading ideologies and others.   
  
The identification of potential threat sources and the understanding of their motivations are crucial to  
knowing what type of preparedness and security requirements must be organized to minimize, avert  
or eliminate potential exposure.

----------------------- Page 12-----------------------

  
  
  
  
  
Despite the benefits, the increasing use and rapid growth of critical cyber infrastructures have  
amplified the risks in our national security environment.  
  
Here are the major contributory factors why such a situation occurs despite the benefits that ICT  
provides:  
  
1. Dependency – Increasing dependence on the use of information and information and  
communication systems for individual and corporate undertakings.  
  
2. Interdependency – Digital infrastructures are interdependent in terms of system configurations,  
connectivity and applications. The failure of one digital infrastructure can cause the failure of another  
infrastructure or vice versa.   
  
3. Globalization – The globalization of business operations and processes requires the need for real- 
time information and information resources. Inability to perform these functions can constitute  
substantial income and opportunity losses.   
  
4. Standardization of Technology - Standardization of technology for interoperability and system  
efficiency opens up windows of vulnerabilities that will be common to all systems and to the  
knowledge of everyone.   
  
5. Technology as a Force Multiplier – Information and communication technology provided equal  
opportunity to government, military and police organizations as well as to individuals, criminal and  
terrorist organizations. ICT provides the advantage of speed, stealth, wide coverage in terms of  
distance and target, anonymity, low cost, and high success potential among others. It only takes a  
personal computer connected to a network and a computer virus to inflict tremendous damage on a  
global scale. ICT is also an effective medium for propaganda.   
  
  
  
  
PART THREE: INTERNATIONAL AND DOMESTIC CYBER SECURITY REGIME  
  
  
  
  
The pervasiveness of threats to critical cyber infrastructure has long been considered an  
international problem. This prompted the international community to draft guidelines and implement  
measures to curb its increasing potential to undermine the peaceful world order. The Philippines,  
being a member of different international organizations, recognizes and subscribes to these  
guidelines as essential ingredients in its own cyber security planning and programs.   
  
  
I. INTERNATIONAL REGIME  
  
A. UNITED NATIONS  
  
  

----------------------- Page 13-----------------------

  
  
  
  
The importance of dealing with cybersecurity concerns attained international status and character  
owing to its pervasiveness and capability to undermine the peaceful world order. The UN General  
Assembly during its 81st Plenary Meeting on December 4, 2000 adopted Resolution 55/63 entitled  
Combating the Criminal Misuse of Information Technologies which provides among others that:   
  
(a) States should ensure that their laws and practice eliminate safe havens for those who criminally  
misuse information technologies;  
  
(b) Law enforcement cooperation in the investigation and prosecution of international cases of  
criminal misuse of information technologies should be coordinated among all concerned States;  
  
(c) Information should be exchanged between States regarding the problems that they face in  
combating the criminal misuse of information technologies;  
  
(d) Law enforcement personnel should be trained and equipped to address the criminal misuse of  
information technologies;  
  
(e) Legal systems should protect the confidentiality, integrity and availability of data and computer  
systems from unauthorized impairment and ensure that criminal abuse is penalized;  
  
(f) Legal systems should permit the preservation of and quick access to electronic data pertaining to  
particular criminal investigations;  
  
(g) Mutual assistance regimes should ensure the timely investigation of the criminal misuse of  
information technologies and the timely gathering and exchange of evidence in such cases;  
  
(h) The general public should be made aware of the need to prevent and combat the criminal misuse  
of information technologies;  
  
(i) To the extent practicable, information technologies should be designed to help prevent and detect  
criminal misuse, trace criminals and collect evidence;  
  
(j) The fight against the criminal misuse of information technologies requires the development of  
solutions taking into account both the protection of individual freedoms and privacy and the  
preservation of the capacity of Governments to fight such criminal misuse;  
  
In a subsequent Resolution 56/121, the UN moved to invite Member States, when developing  
national law, policy and practice to combat the criminal misuse of information technologies, and take  
into account, as appropriate, the work and achievements of the Commission on Crime Prevention  
and Criminal Justice and of other international and regional organizations;  
  
The most significant effort on the part of the UN in the area of cybersecurity was the adoption of  
Resolution 57/239 entitled Creation of a Global Culture of Cybersecurity during its 78th Plenary  
Meeting on 20 December 2002. This resolution provided an annex wherein it recognized nine  
complementary elements in creating a global cybersecurity culture and set Member-States’  
individual responsibilities. For the purposes of this Plan, extensively quoted hereunder is the content  
of the annex of Resolution 57/239 which enumerates the said elements.  
  
(a) Awareness. Participants should be aware of the need for security of information systems and  

----------------------- Page 14-----------------------

networks and what they can do to enhance security;  
  
(b) Responsibility. Participants are responsible for the security of information systems and networks  
in a manner appropriate to their individual roles. They should review their own policies, practices,  
measures and procedures regularly, and should assess whether they are appropriate to their  
environment;  
  
(c) Response. Participants should act in a timely and cooperative manner to prevent, detect and  
respond to security incidents. They should share information about threats and vulnerabilities, as  
appropriate, and implement procedures for rapid and effective cooperation to prevent, detect and  
respond to security incidents. This may involve cross-border information-sharing and cooperation;  
  
(d) Ethics. Given the pervasiveness of information systems and networks in modern societies,  
participants need to respect the legitimate interests of others and recognize that their action or  
inaction may harm others;  
  
(e) Democracy. Security should be implemented in a manner consistent with the values recognized  
by democratic societies, including the freedom to exchange thoughts and ideas, the free flow of  
information, the confidentiality of information and communication, the appropriate protection of  
personal information, openness and transparency;  
  
(f) Risk assessment. All participants should conduct periodic risk assessments that identify threats  
and vulnerabilities; are sufficiently broad-based to encompass key internal and external factors, such  
as technology, physical and human factors, policies and third-party services with security  
implications; allow determination of the acceptable level of risk; and assist in the selection of  
appropriate controls to manage the risk of potential harm to information systems and networks in the  
light of the nature and importance of the information to be protected;  
  
(g) Security design and implementation. Participants should incorporate security as an essential  
element in the planning and design, operation and use of information systems and networks;  
  
(h) Security management. Participants should adopt a comprehensive approach to security  
management based on risk assessment that is dynamic, encompassing all levels of participants’  
activities and all aspects of their operations;  
  
(i) Reassessment. Participants should periodically review and reassess the security of information  
systems and networks and should make appropriate modifications to security policies, practices,  
measures and procedures that include addressing new and changing threats and vulnerabilities.  
  
  
  
  
B. APEC CYBERSECURITY STRATEGY  
  
  
  
  
  
  
On October 21, 2001 the APEC Leaders issued their Statement on Counter-Terrorism that  
condemned terrorist attacks and deemed it imperative to strengthen cooperation at all levels in  
combating terrorism in a comprehensive manner. As part of this statement, the leaders called for  
strengthening APEC activities in the area of critical infrastructure protection, including  

----------------------- Page 15-----------------------

telecommunications. On May 30, 2002, the Telecommunications and Information Ministers of the  
APEC economies issued the Shanghai Declaration that included a Statement on the Security of  
Information and Communications Infrastructures and a Program of Action.   
  
The expansion and potential effects on individual member-economies of computers and information  
networks have made it important for them to coordinate their cyber crime and infrastructure  
protection efforts more rapidly and efficiently. Issues and activities in the following areas namely  
legal developments, information-sharing and cooperation, security and technical guidelines, public  
awareness, training and education and wireless security, serve as the basis for APEC’s efforts on  
cyber crime and critical infrastructure protection. Said concerns could also form the basis of meeting  
the stated objectives of Leaders and Ministers.  
  
APEC recognizes that the fight against cyber crime and the protection of critical infrastructures is  
built upon the legal frameworks of every economy. In particular, cyber security depends on every  
economy having (1) substantive laws that criminalize attacks on networks, (2) procedural laws to  
ensure that law enforcement officials have the necessary authorities to investigate and prosecute  
offenses facilitated by technology, and (3) laws and policies that allow for international cooperation  
with other parties in the struggle against computer-related crimes.   
  
  
  
  
C. ASEAN CYBER SECURITY INITIATIVE  
  
  
  
During the Third ASEAN Telecommunications and Information Technology Ministers Meeting (3rd  
ASEAN TELMIN), ASEAN Ministers, in a joint statement, vowed to enhance regional cooperation in  
cybersecurity. Specifically, the ASEAN members committed to establish National Computer  
Emergency Response Teams (CERTs) by 2005. All member countries will also, by 2004, shall have  
established a common framework for sharing cybersecurity threat and vulnerability assessment  
information. Cybersecurity expertise and information will be shared among member countries to help  
develop cybersecurity policies and exchange real-time information on cybersecurity issues.   
  
  
  
  
II. LEGAL REGIME IN THE FIELD OF CYBER SECURITY IN THE PHILIPPINES   
  
  
  
  
  
  
The government has to have laws instituted to help protect companies and consumers from abuses  
and to address internet security in a global context. The Philippines is governed by the following  
legislations pertaining to the utilization, development and protection of the Philippine cyberspace:  
  
- Republic Act 7935 or the Philippine Public Telecommunications Policy Act enacted on March 1,  
1995 which regulated the telecommunications industry in the country;  
  
- Republic Act 8484 entitled Access Devices Regulation Act of 1998 dated February 11, 1998 which  
regulated the issuance and use of certain access devices. It defined access device fraud as a  

----------------------- Page 16-----------------------

criminal offense;  
  
- Executive Order No 467 dated March 17 1998 which set forth guidelines that will govern the  
operation and use of satellite telecommunications facilities and services in the country;  
  
  
  
- Republic Act 8747 or the Philippine Year 2000 Readiness and Disclosure Act which was approved  
on June 01, 1999, setting the necessary guidelines to ensure the readiness of Philippine computer  
systems, products and services against the Y2K bug;  
  
- Executive Order 269 dated January 12 2004 which created the Commission on Information and  
Communications Technology as the governing body in all ICT-related activities in the country.  
  
One of the most important cybersecurity legislations in the Philippines at present is Republic Act  
8792 or the E-Commerce Act which was enacted on June 14, 2000. While Section 33 of RA 8792  
now lays out how hacking, cracking and piracy should be punished, the government still need to  
pass another law on cyber crime, cyber fraud and similar offenses.   
  
  
At present the Congress still has to pass the consolidated version of four cyber crime bills (House  
Bill Nos. 1310, 3241, 4083 and 5560) that were filed during the Twelfth Congress. The consolidated  
version “AN ACT DEFINING CYBERCIME, PROVIDING FOR PREVENTION, SUPPRESSION AND  
IMPOSITION OF PENALTIES THEREFOR AND FOR OTHER PURPOSES” OR THE  
CYBERCRIME PREVENTION ACT OF 2003 shall have to re-submitted to congress for enactment.

5. Vulnerability Assessment  
  
This shall be jointly undertaken with the private sector, with an incentive scheme to generate support  
from them.   
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
PART FIVE: THE WAY AHEAD  
  
  
  
  
  
The threats to our critical cyber infrastructures are real. The growing exploitation of information and  
communication technology to improve the lives of Filipinos, coupled with our increasing dependence  
to these infrastructures for the operation of our economy and government, poses greater risk given  
the threats that are inherent to these opportunities. It is therefore imperative that the protection of  
these infrastructures should be a strategic component in national security programs to ensure the  
protection of our national interests.  
  
No feasible combination of domestic or international policy options can make us completely  
invulnerable to cyber attacks in the future. Nevertheless, enhancing security in our critical cyber  
infrastructures can prepare the country to all forms of malicious activities or threats that lay ahead in  
the cyberspace.  
  
The private sector has to assume a major and supportive role in organizing and mobilizing  
communities, business and supportive organizations and groups towards our national goal of  
securing our critical infrastructures. We have to communicate and advocate for strong public support  
to this program by educating and partnering with stakeholders.   
  
In today’s security environment, cyber threats whether individual, organization or nation-sponsored,  
are designed to cripple a nation’s capacity to carry out its information-based enterprises. Threats  
metamorphose faster than our capability to implement counter-measures. Being caught unprepared  
to meet these challenges might prove disastrous for the country.   
  
Protecting the future is the primary responsibility of each and every Filipino today. If the Philippines  
intends to join the ranks of nations that have become information-based societies, security of the  
Philippine cyberspace must be pursued with urgency. It should be made a vital component of the  
over-all strategic, operational and tactical priorities of our national security strategy.

INTRODUCTION  
  
Terrorism, cyber and otherwise, continues to be one of the most serious threats facing the security  
of countries all over the world. No country is immune to attack or exploitation by terrorists and no  
one can afford to retreat from the problem.  
The Philippines is no exception. Its government, therefore, should step-up its defense program to  
safeguard the nation not only from physical terrorist attack, in general, but from cyber threats to its  
major, critical infrastructure nationwide.  
The nation’s critical infrastructures, such as: telecommunications, banking, agriculture, and industrial  
centers, and their mutual dependencies and interconnectedness as enabled through information and  
communications technology (ICT) is a prime target, vulnerable at the moment, even to the most  
basic of virus attacks and malicious conduct. The high dependencies of these critical infrastructures  
on ICT have made them highly vulnerable to the malevolent intention of lawless elements through  
cyber exploits and terrorism.  
The threats of attacks to critical infrastructure have serious ramifications to the nation’s immediate  
economic survival. With a new mandate from the people, the President, Her Excellency Gloria  
Macapagal-Arroyo, is in the best position to take the lead in recognizing the urgency and immediacy  
of providing a short, as well as, a long term solution to the protection of critical infrastructures and  
tapping both the private and public sector to collaborate in this shared national responsibility.  
Through a resolution submitted during the First National Summit on Critical ICT Protection at the  
EDSA Shangrila on 16 April 2004, to the office of the President, through Executive Secretary  
Romulo, the joint public-private Task Force on Security for Critical Infrastructure (TFSCI) has put  
forth the development and implementation of a RP National Cyber Security Strategy (RP-NCCS) in  
the soonest possible time to include but not limited to the following:  
  
a. Formulation, fast-tracking and pro-active advocacy of related regulatory and legislative agenda in  
order to provide the necessary legal regime and policy environment.  

----------------------- Page 28-----------------------

b. Conduct of a nationwide cyber security awareness program to promote a common understanding  
among stakeholders;  
c. Conduct of risk and vulnerability assessment in order to identify risk areas and effect the  
establishment and adoption of internationally-accepted cyber security standards;  
d. Institutionalization of cyber-security capability-building programs in order to produce a critical  
mass of RP cyber-security professionals; and  
e. Establishment of a National and Sectoral Computer Security and Incident Response Team to  
ensure that the country is able to immediately respond to all possible forms of cyber threats and  
incidents.  
  
To set the tone and initiate action, the Task Force, after a March workshop in DAP, Tagaytay agreed  
to pursue subsequent planning activities through the creation of five (5) planning teams.  
  
THE CYSWG EFFORTS  
  
In 13 January 2004, the NCC– CySWG crafted its preliminary Work Plan which was submitted and  
approved by the COC-IS thru the TFSCI  
  
In this preliminary work plan the CySWG identified the following priority programs/ projects:  
 A database of critical cyber infrastructure  
 Establishment of national, regional and sectoral Computer Security Incident Response Teams  
(CSIRT)  
 A nationwide adoption of Information Security Standards  
 Cyber security policies and implementation plans (National Cyber Security Strategy)  
  
On March 28-29, 2004, a CySWG organizational workshop was conducted at DAP, Tagaytay to  
decide on the final organizational setup, identify short and long- term programs and activities, and  
define functions and tasks of the various CySWG committees under the Task Force for the Security  
of Critical Infrastructure (TFSCI).  
  
The following five (5) committees were formed during the DAP workshop and these were formalized  
at The National Security Summit held at the Shangila EDSA Hotel last 16 April, 2004. The  
committees are:  
  
1. Risk and Vulnerability Assessment Committee (R/VAC)  
2. Training and Education Committee (T-TRAIN)  
3. Security Awareness and Advocacy Committee (SAWAT)  
4. Formulation and Implementation of Cyber Security Policies Committee (FISPOL)  
5. Incident Intervention and Consequence Management Committee (I-ICON)  
  
An Oversight Committee chaired by DG Tim De Rivera was also formed to oversee and monitor the  
planning and implementation process to be followed by the CySWG Task Force committees.  
  
  
THE 5 TFSCI-CYSWG PLANNING COMMITTEES  
  
The various committees are depicted as shown below  
  
  
  
  
  
The major objective and function of each committee is shown in the following table:  

----------------------- Page 29-----------------------

  
  
Committee Major Objective  
FISPOL Formulate and implement policies, regulations and rules of conduct for CySWG members  
and affected parties or industries.  
RVAC Identify and assess risk and vulnerabilities of critical infrastructures  
SAWAT Promote security awareness training to ciritical infrastructure and affected publics  
T-TRAIN Develop competent security professionals to protect and support cyber infrastructure  
I-ICON Provide coordination, response and exchange of incident information among the various in- 
government, private and regional/global incident response teams on a 24x7 basis  
O-OVER Oversee the planning and implementation of the various CySWG committee efforts  
  
  
SUB-COMMITTEE WORK  
The organizational workshop was soon followed by the following sub-committee workshops to  
finalize the individual sub-committee plans and programs:  
  
 April 15 & 16 - to kick off the TFSCI-CSWG activities, a National Cyber Security Summit was  
conducted with an end view to increase awareness on the CySWG plans and programs, and to  
foster public and private partnership  
 April 30 & May 1 – planning workshop at DAP, Tagaytay for the Risk and Vulnerability  
Assessment Committee (R/VAC)  
 May 26 & 27 – planning workshop at Las Brisas, Antipolo for the Formulation and Implementation  
of Cyber Security Policies Committee (FISPOL)  
 May 28 & 29 – planning workshop at Las Brisas, Antipolo for the Security Awareness and  
Advocacy Committee (SAWAT)  
 June 15 &  16 – planning workshop at DAP, Tagaytay for the Training and Education Committee  
(T-TRAIN)  
 June 17 & 18 – planning workshop at DAP, Tagaytay for the Incident Intervention and  
Consequence Management Committee (I-ICON)  
  
In between, several other small group meetings took place among the various members of the  
committees to work on after-workshop assignments and other unfinished business as needed.  
  
THE TFSCI-CYSWG IMPLEMENTATION PLAN  
This plan therefore is a result of the planning efforts of the various committees of the Cyber Security  
Work Group (CySWG) under the auspices of the Task Force on the Security of Critical Infrastructure  
(TFSCI).  
The plan is being presented as an initial working plan based on the perspective of the committee  
members under the influence of their respective agency training, orientation and bias. It is suggested  
that the plan undergo validation by the senior members of the TFSCI and from the overall view of a  
composite Physical Security and Cyber Security perspective. There were also the consideration of  
funding, executive preference, and other national prioritization issues that were not taken into  
account during the CySWG planning workshops.  
  
THE CYBER SECURITY WORK GROUP (CYSWG) MISSION  
To ensure that the critical infrastructure of the country is   
99.9% safe and protected in cyberspace  
  
THE CYBER SECURITY WORK GROUP FUNCTION  
The information and process flow among the various CySWG functions are envisioned as follows:

ORGANIZATIONAL REQUIREMENTS: HOW TO PROCEED FROM HERE  
Considering that the members of the Task Force Committees consist of volunteer government and  
private employees who may not be available to commit their time and effort in a continuing, as- 
needed and sustained basis, the CySWG must convert itself or seek the set up or organization of a  
permanent body with an official charter. This body must, as a minimum have full-time,  
knowledgeable and qualified ICT professionals and managers who will polish and fine-tune the plan  
and carry out its implementation based on their (new people) respective capacities and capabilities.  
Where extra hands and know how are needed, the managers and leaders of the renewed  
permanent body can simply tap the talents and abilities of either the current members of the CySWG  
committees or outsourced to experts in the field.  
  
All the committees agreed to the formation of a permanent body to implement the TFSCI master  
plan. Each member realized his role was temporary and his responsibility self-imposed, if at all.  
Some members have expressed their willingness to be part of the new body, if at all formed,  
depending on their assigned roles and individual working arrangements.  
  
Although no formal organizational structure or composition of the new permanent organization was  
discussed and submitted during the various planning meetings and workshops, the consensus was  
that the permanent body will have to be formed depending on the political and financial situation at  
the time of formation.  
  
Some functions though are critical and have to be manned by experts in these fields. The two most  
critical functions of the new organized permanent body (New-CySWG) are:  
 Technical Training (T-TRAIN)  
  Incident Response (I-ICON)  
  
THE TECHNICAL TRAINING (T-TRAIN) FUNCTION  
The T-Train function will have to be done professionally and on a continuing, sustained basis. At the  
moment, the necessary expertise and know how, in terms of course content and delivery  
mechanisms are not available in one single entity or training institution. It is suggested that the  
training be formalized initially under the NCC, considering that NCC already has the training facilities  
and the mandate to do ICT and related training.  
The NCC facility can be part of the permanent New-CySWG organization until such time that the  
plans of NCC or the New-CySWG will say otherwise.  
NCC, as the New-T-Train can now implement and upgrade the T-Train plan which includes tapping  
outside expertise on an as-needed basis. The first order of the day is for NCC to organize a train- 
the-trainor program and carry out the certification process for its newly trained ICT Security mentors  
and instructors.  
The New-T-Train can follow the plan of action of the T-Train committee as follows:  
  Identify training gaps  
 Outsource and tap applicable programs/technologies, courseware and trainors  
  Implement training and delivery programs  
  
The T-Train committee has also identified as a resulting business or output, consulting, curriculum  
development and certification as among its potential product or services to follow. Since the critical  

----------------------- Page 33-----------------------

need for the immediate time frame is for training on ICT security of government and the critical  
infrastructure, the auxiliary business of T-Train may have to wait and its pursuit subject to the will  
and wherewithal of the permanent officers or managers to be designated. Training, per se, is already  
a full-time job and a major undertaking concern for most managers. It will take a leader with an  
insatiable business sense and acumen to expand into the complex world of consultancy and  
courseware development as an add-on business.  
For the certification, this may be better done in cooperation with TESDA and the ICT-Industry  
Working Group who are now in the process of professionalizing the certification so these can be  
brought to a stage where the industry and the business community can look at a certified ICT worker  
with pride and confidence rather than with doubt and distrust.  
  
THE INCIDENT RESPONSE (I-ICON) FUNCTION  
The incident response function has to be a permanent and fully funded function of the New-CySWG.  
This is and will be the heart of the cyber protection capability of the country. If the new I-ICON fails to  
beat, the whole body or network of data, information and processing of such, stops.  
The I-ICON function and for that matter the task of providing response and protection to the  
information community is proposed by the CySWG through the creation of a National Computer  
Security Incident Response Team (NCSIRT). It is also referred to as the Government CSIRT or G- 
CSIRT. If an agency, these can be referred to as the National Information Security Agency (NISA) to  
encompass all forms of security issues and concerns whether LAN-based, Cyber-based or simply a  
corporate misdemeanor or crime against a standalone information system in a private or government  
enclave.  
The I-ICON function is a coordination and feeding center for the country’s input and output of cyber  
nuances. Into its bowels and veins will flow the various threats and incidents of intrusions, viruses,  
attacks and even simply misuse or abuse of computer use.  
Contrary to the notion of border patrol and control, the I-ICON will never have direct control or  
supervision over any other cybersite, whether on-country or off-country. The major function and  
significance of a government incident response coordinating center, however, is its ability and  
capability to warn, monitor, and inform the cybercommunity of threats and incidents so all those  
within reach and coordinating with the center will be fully warned and therefore can arm themselves  
accordingly.  
The only reason a threat or attack can materialize and succeed is when its intended target is  
uninformed, misinformed or incapable of defending itself. These inadequacies can be overcome by  
proper training and preparation and a reliable, dependable, 24x7 alert system.  
  
THE OTHER FUNCTIONS  
For the other functions, these can continue as committee work and eventually can be absorbed by  
the New-CySWG, G-CSIRT or NISA to be formed. Once a new set of permanent employees are  
employed, the other tasks and function may be relegated to inhouse experts or simply outsourced on  
an as needed basis.  
The Risk Assessment (RVAC) function can be done on a quarterly or continuing basis by outsourced  
third party assessors. The New-CySWG only have to come up with standards by which critical  
infrastructure and institutions are to be assessed.  
The Awareness function and activities (SAWAT) can be implemented inhouse or outsourced to a  
public relations agency, once the marketing advocacy plan is done. Marketing, and especially  
advocacy efforts like those required for cybersecurity are better in the hands of marketing-oriented  
professionals than in ICT people’s hands. Technical people, and we will have the more technically  
inclined in the New-CySWG, will be the wrong people to advocate security. They will either scare the  
hell out of their constituents or droop them to sleep with their technical litanies.  
Lastly, the Policies function (FISPOL) shall eventually become the responsibility of the New-CySWG  
management and not an adhoc committee from the outside. Once the business of the permanent  
organization is installed, any policy, guidelines, directions and the like, will have to emanate from the  
management and/or their direct superiors.  

----------------------- Page 34-----------------------

The oversight function will also have to be relinquished to the New-CySWG leadership. Theirs will be  
the responsibility and accountability of making this country, safely, securely and soundly functioning  
in LAN or Cyber space.  
  
SHORT-TERM PLAN  
For the short-term (up to the end of the year), the various committees have put up their action plans  
in terms of activities and deliverables. Details of these plans and activities are in the attachments.  
The attachments though reflect a first draft resulting from the sentiments of those who were present  
and participated during the workshops. Only the more implementable or doable activities were  
selected from the long list of recommended actions produced by the five (5) committees during their  
respective planning workshops.  
The individual committee worksheets with all their detailed computations and assumptions are  
included in the hard copy outputs as well as in the accompanying CD for those who may want to  
review them at a later date.  
  
RECOMMENDATIONS  
From a practical perspective, there are two major recommendations, and these are:  
  
1. Form the G-CSIRT or NISA as soon as possible. From the findings of the workshop, there is a  
need to formalize the creation of a “Response Team” at the least. And these team has to have the  
necessary mandate and authority to work with, negotiate and represent the national interest on  
matters of information security as a whole.  
2. Formalize the development and implementation of a National Strategy for Information Security as  
a whole (not just Cyber Security). With the passage of the E-commerce Law in 2000 and the  
formation of the ITECC and the CICS, the National Strategy for Information Security will be a boon  
and welcomed protective mantel to the many other ICT plans and strategies adopted and adapted  
by the ICT community in the last decade. Cyber as well as inhouse or local information security  
breach can damage a business or even whole government more than it can any breach of physical  
security. Some companies with headquarters in the collapsed Twin Towers as a result of the 9-11  
tragedy continue to do business simply they had backups and contingency provisions for their data  
and information systems. But no business can continue once their mass of data and their ability to  
process and compute is wiped out by a virus or malicious attack.  
  
CONCLUSION  
Implementing the plans and programs herein proposed or revised as needed, will require a different  
set of knowledge, attitude and skills set. It is recommended that the final composition of staff and / or  
committee members who will carry out these plans and programs be selected based on their  
knowledge, attitude, skills and availability to carry out plans and programs… and not just to plan!
