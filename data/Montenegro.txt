CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY FOR MONTENEGRO 2017
1. INTRODUCTION
Information and communications technology present an irreplaceable part of modern life.
Integration of ICT in performing daily activities and tasks has become more and more evident,
therefore, threats to information and communications infrastructure that may threaten the
availability, privacy and integrity of them, may also affect the functioning of society as a
whole.
The adoption of national cyber strategy is a complex task given the different aspects and
stakeholders who should be included in this process. Here we can discuss about political,
legislative, economic, military and similar aspects when adopting the strategy, as well as
about integration of public and private sectors as infrastructure owners.
Montenegro’s strategic objective is to build an integrated, functional and efficient cyberspace,
in accordance with international standards and principles.
Every country is obliged to protect their national information infrastructure, as well as their
cyberspace that national domain is covering.
In order to respond to cyber threats from the environment, which are constantly changing,
the country must have flexible and dynamic cyber security strategies. The cross border nature
of threats makes it necessary for the countries to focus on strong international cooperation.
Comprehensive national cyber security strategies make the first step in this direction.
The Strategy should have clearly defined objectives and priorities, and the practice is that
they are defined within a period of 5 years. Along with text of the Strategy, which presents a
vision of a state against the concept of cyber security and its guaranty, the corresponding
annual action plans are also defined.
Internet and information and communications technology that the Internet is based on,
present a vital resource for socio-economic growth and development of a country. As more
and more services have been offered via the Internet, there is a growing number of reported
cyber security incidents, the attacks known as distributed denial of service attacks – DDoS
attacks, up to attacks on websites with the aim of unauthorised modification of their content.
Special type of threat is also an unauthorised access to developed information systems of
state authorities and their databases. Cyber-attacks are also directed against infrastructure of
Internet service providers (ISPs), however there is no coordinated response which would be
3

2013

CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY FOR MONTENEGRO 2017
conducted through safe communication channels at the national level in order to address
such situations.
One of the problems is the lack of necessary skills for successful defence from the incidents, as
well as the need for amendments or for adopting new laws, under which it would be possible
to successfully detect and prosecute people involved in any form of cybercrime.
Another important problem is that in Montenegro there is no a defined way to monitor or
record the malicious traffic entering the country. There are no adequate monitoring systems
installed on communication nodes (gateways) towards abroad or at ISPs level, except for
detection and prevention of attacks directed towards denial of service (DoS-DDoS).
Coordinated construction of organisational, institutional and management capacities,
improvement of laws and by-laws are important items of information security existence in
Montenegro.
Recognising its foreign policy priorities through full membership in NATO and EU, provision
of mandated safety criteria at the national level has become priority of the entire information
society of Montenegro.
At the same time, economic and industrial espionage directed against the leading companies
and governments is getting importance with development and progress in the field of
information technology. Finally, illegal entry, data manipulation and destruction of critical
resources also threaten integrity and resilience of critical infrastructure.
In cyberspace, “malicious programmes in the service of states” designate the present and in
the future it will be one major threats to the national security of a country.
The above mentioned supports the fact that the Internet and related global networks have
significantly increased the global dependence on ICT, but also the level of potential damage
that can be caused when the infrastructure is under attack.
Information Security Strategy relies on a document adopted by the Government of
Montenegro, titled “Study with defined responsibilities of state authorities in their fight
against cyber (computer) crime”.
Therefore, the adoption of Strategy with a clear vision in terms of implementing specific
activities in the field of cyber security is crucial.

CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY FOR MONTENEGRO 2017
2. DEFINITIONS
The analysis of Cyber Security Strategy in great number of countries has found that there is
no agreed definition of terms such as: information security, cyberspace, cyber security,
cybercrime, etc. Whereas some strategies define these terms precisely and concisely, for
example, by closely linking them to computer systems, others have a more general approach
and definitions include not only matters relating to computers and computer systems, but to
any other factor that may interact with them, such as human factor. In this chapter will be
presented definitions of specific terms existing in our country, which are also compliant with
basic meaning of the terms in EU countries.
“Cyber” is defined as: “anything relating to, or involving, computers or computer networks
(such as Internet)”. Cyberspace is more than Internet; it includes not only hardware,
software and information systems, but also the people, social interaction within these
networks. International Telecommunication Union (ITU) uses this term to describe “systems
and services connected either directly to or indirectly to the Internet, telecommunications
and computer networks”. International Standardisation Organisation (ISO) uses a slightly
different definition of the term, and describes “cyber” as “complex environment resulting
from the interaction of people, software, and services on the Internet by means of technology
devices and networks connected to it, which does not exist in any physical form”. Individually,
each country, when formulating national strategy, uses their own terms and definitions. For
example, the United Kingdom defines cyberspace as “all forms of networked, digital activities;
this includes the content of and actions conducted through digital networks”.
Information security includes the state of confidentiality, integrity and availability of
information. Information security is focused on data regardless of their form: electronic,
printed and other forms of data.
Computer security usually seeks to ensure availability and proper functioning of the
computer and computer system.
The above-mentioned terms are often alternatively used, although they are related to slightly
different aspects in the field of cyber security.

5

2013

CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY FOR MONTENEGRO 2017
Internet security in technical context, refers to “protection of Internet service and related
ICT systems and networks as extension of network security in organisations and homes, and
to ensure the security purpose”. Internet security also provides availability and reliability of
Internet service. However, in political context, Internet security is often equated with what is
also known as safe use of the Internet. According to some definitions, Internet security
includes a global regime dealing with stability of Internet code and hardware, as well as with
agreements on prosecuting illegal content. Network security is also important for critical
infrastructures that are often not directly connected to the Internet.
Cyber security – International Standardisation Organisation (ISO) defines cyber security as
“preservation of confidentiality, integrity and availability of information in cyberspace”. The
Netherlands have offered a little broader definition: “freedom from danger or damage caused
by disruption, failure or abuse of ICT systems” Danger or damage caused by disruption,
failure or abuse may consist of a limitation in the availability or reliability of ICT systems, a
breach of the confidentiality stored in them, or damage to the integrity of the information. ITU
also defines broadly the cyber security: “collection of tools, policies, security concepts,
security safeguards, guidelines, risk management approaches, actions, training, best practices,
assurance and technologies that can be used to protect the cyber environment and
organisation and user’s assets. Cyber security seeks to ensure the attainment and
maintenance of the security properties of the organisation and user’s assets against relevant
security risks in the cyber environment. General security objectives comprise the following:
availability; integrity, which may include

authenticity and

non-repudiation; and

confidentiality”.
Cyber defence is mainly used in military context, but it may be also related to criminal and
espionage activities.
NATO uses the following definition when referring to cyber defence “the ability to safeguard
the delivery and management of services in an operational Communications and Information
Systems (CIS) in response to potential and imminent as well as actual malicious actions that
originate in cyberspace.”
Cybercrime – or e-crime, or high-tech crime includes criminal activities in which computers
and other IT equipment and computer network are subject, tool, target or place of crime.

6

2013

CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY FOR MONTENEGRO 2017
Cyberspace is identified as environment with the fastest growing crime rate. Over the last
decade, most countries have identified the problem of cybercrime and accordingly passed and
adopted adequate laws. In 1997, China identified as illegal activity “intrusion into computer
information system”; in 2004 the Council of Europe adopted Convention on Cybercrime which
has relatively high standards in the field of international cooperation and for the purpose of
prosecuting cybercrime, it was signed by 51 countries.
It is estimated that in 2011 appeared more than 400 million of different variations of viruses
and on average 8 new “zero-day” exploits on a daily basis. This figure is an alarming fact. As
the borders of legal prosecution are equal to borders of various states, strong need for close
international cooperation has been identified.
Cyber terrorism – is a criminal act in cyberspace that aims to intimidate governments or
their citizens, with the aim to achieve political goals. NIPC (National Infrastructure Protection
Center) defines cyber terrorism as “a criminal act perpetrated through computers resulting in
violence, death and/or destruction, and creating terror for the purpose of coercing a
government to change its policies”.
Cyber espionage is defined as “the use of an agent in order to obtain information about plans
or activities of foreign country or competitive company”. It is not uncommon that companies
or governments are faced with attempts of unauthorised access to their computer systems via
Internet. Many countries use espionage tools to encourage their economic development based
on advanced technologies of other nations. ICT present foundation of development and
implementation of most other technologies both in civilian and military sectors, and
thereupon they have become primary target of espionage.
Cyber war is unspecified and controversial term that has no official or generally accepted
definition. More than 30 countries have accepted the doctrine and announced development of
a special programme of cyber war offensive mechanisms.

CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY FOR MONTENEGRO 2017
3. CYBER SECURITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM
One of key recommendations of international bodies (NATO, ENISA) is that the strategy
should be developed within the life cycle, which should include the following stages:
1. Development,
2. Implementation,
3. Evaluation and
4. Adaptation strategy.
This way will ensure continued progress of strategy, procedures and products, and in
accordance with changed circumstances in immediate and wider environment.
Public authority or internal working group or Council on the national level should be defined
as strategy implementation coordinator, and should also be responsible for monitoring the
overall strategy life cycle. The positive practice is that, on one hand, members of this body to
be persons covering public or private function and, on the other hand, to have advanced
knowledge in the field of cyber protection and security, in order to have sufficient credibility
and more efficiently provide implementation of identified strategic objectives.
Successful implementation of Cyber Security Strategy requires adequate and continued
cooperation of public and private sector, i.e. stakeholders from one or the other sector. The
selected private entities should be part of development and implementation process because
of probability that they are the owners of critical information infrastructure and service.
Development and planning of national cyber crisis plan represents an important factor in
general planning of a state’s cyber security. It should be realistic and accurate and it should
also take into account all possible stakeholders. This includes interaction of public and private
sector.
The Strategy should definitely include national risk assessment, which must be realistic, with
a view to more efficient strategy implementation. During the assessment, it is necessary to
have a defined methodology, as well as approach that would provide considering all possible
existing threats and risks.

8

2013

CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY FOR MONTENEGRO 2017
Important part of this process is identification and definition of critical national
infrastructure, its threats and risks. These should be classified by degree of their impact, i.e.
consequences that they would entail, as well as by the probability assessment of their actual
occurrence.
3.1 METHOD OF MONITORING STARTEGY LIFE CYCLE
Along with constant engagement about the Strategy, which must follow the corresponding life
cycle, here are indicated more specific activities that decision makers should implement:


Define a vision, scope, objectives and priorities;



Monitor risk assessments at the national level;



Consider the existing policies, regulations and capacities;



Develop clear management structure;

3.2 CHALLENGES, RISKS, THREATS TO CYBERSPACE SECURITY IN MONTENEGRO
Research on the use of information and communications technology in Montenegro,
conducted by the Statistical Office of Montenegro in 2012, provided the following results:
Households:
• 51.3% have access to personal computer (PC),
• 33.6% of households use laptop
• 93.3% have a mobile phone.
In Montenegro, 55.0% of households surveyed said they had Internet access at home. Internet
access is thereby achieved by means of a certain device such as personal computer (PC) –
75.3% of households and laptop – 52.0%. In addition to these devices, to access the Internet
they also use mobile phones – 24.2%, handheld computers (palmtop, PDA, tablet), game
consoles (Play Station), etc.
To the question "Have you in the last 12 months encountered any of the problems related to
security while using the Internet for private purposes?", citizens responded as follows:

To the question whether they use IT security software to protect their private computer and
data kept in it (antivirus, anti-spam, firewall, etc.), the following results have been obtained:

Business entities:
In Montenegro, 88.3% of companies surveyed stated that they used computers in their
operations during January 2012.
According to survey results, 53.3% of the companies (who used computers in their
operations) allowed their employees a remote access to e-mail system, documents or
company applications in January 2012.
As regards to the Internet, the survey showed that 96.1% of companies who used the
computer, had access to the Internet in January 2012. This represents an increase of 1% in
comparison to the previous year. Out of the companies that had access to the Internet, 53.1%
responded that they had a Web Site/Home Page, in January 2012.
To the question about the employing IT professionals in January 2012, only 20.8% of
companies responded that they employed professionals whose main job is information
technology.
In Montenegro, only 27.9% of companies have the Rulebook that normatively regulates
information security issues. There is also a very small percentage of companies that conduct
assessment of employees knowledge about information security measures, only 26.9%.

11

2013

CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY FOR MONTENEGRO 2017
Key risks, challenges and threats to cyber security in Montenegro include the
following:
a. Shortcomings in organization of cyber protection may pose a threat to
national security of Montenegro;
b. Internet in Europe and in our close environment is intensively used for
criminal purposes, for the purposes of drug trafficking, money laundering
and financial frauds, thereupon Montenegro is not and will not be spared
from this threat;
c. ICT infrastructure, computer systems and users in Montenegro are exposed
to most of cyber threats and attacks that affect the rest of the world. This
includes malicious programmes, electronic frauds, web page headline
changes (Web Defacement) and e-mail "hacking";
d. Undeveloped cooperation between private and public sector in the field of
coordination of critical infrastructure security system;
e. The absence of procedure about keeping records on incident situations in
cyberspace of Montenegro;
f. The absence of National Cyber Security Council with its functions:
i. Coordination of information security in Europe
ii. Identification of critical information infrastructure
iii. Review of the legislative framework for the development of
operational cyber security.
g. Cyberspace is increasingly used for organisation and media propaganda of
extremist and radical groups who by this way promote their activities,
recruit new members, organize terrorist actions, and thus pose a threat to
national security of Montenegro.
h. Piracy contributes to high rate of infection with computer viruses.

12

CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY FOR MONTENEGRO 2017
i.

On-line manipulations, using social engineering by means of e-mail
messages, such as “Nigerian 419” scam, phishing, go hand in hand with
identity theft (illegal knowledge of other users’ accounts and passwords).
This situation in Montenegrin cyberspace is worrying and problematic, not
only for Montenegro, but even wider. Montenegrin citizens have in the past
been the target of frauds in which they even happened to lose a great sum of
money;

j.

In the period from 2008 to 2013, the attackers have changed or taken control
over several websites of Montenegrin institutions;

k. In Montenegro, in the past period there have been several attacks on
information infrastructure, Internet service providers as well as on the
banking sector;
l.

In previous years there has been observed a significant number of cases
where the attackers took control over the user profiles of Montenegrin
citizens on social networks and on behalf of the user entered inappropriate
content, in order to compromise the profile owner.

m. From the addresses, for which it has been investigated to come from
Montenegro, malicious activity has been reported, including the spread of
SPAM, password-cracking attacks by using force (brute force), DDoS attacks,
impersonation, and others;
n. In Montenegro, there is a very small number of staff who have highly
specialized knowledge in the field of cyber security, i.e. who have certain
licenses or certificates from this field required by European and
international standards. At the University of Montenegro, there are no
faculties or faculty departments that cover cyber security and forensics, i.e.
which produce human resources with highly specialized knowledge in this
field.

CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY FOR MONTENEGRO 2017
4. INSTITUTIONAL AND LEGISLATIVE FRAMEWORK OF MONTENEGRO

4.1. Analysis of Montenegrin and EU legislation

Over the last couple of years, Montenegro has begun, through the criminal law reforms, to
build a corresponding legal and regulatory framework that legally prevents any kind of
accidental or deliberate distortion and prevention of the computer system functioning. An
appropriate legal framework represents a link between legal and IT areas, which will, by joint
cooperation, contribute to successful clarification of the case in the field of computer crime
and punishing the perpetrators.
In Dubrovnik, on 15th February 2013, Montenegro signed regional Declaration on Strategic
Priorities against Cybercrime, which identifies strategic priorities in the fight against
cybercrime that this Strategy follows and continues to evolve.
European Convention from 1959 on the provision of mutual legal assistance in criminal
matters represents a predecessor of the Convention on Cybercrime, which has been adopted
to serve as a framework to the states wishing to legally codify this kind of socially dangerous
behaviour.
The Convention on Cybercrime or known in the international community as the Budapest
Convention, was adopted on 21st November 2001 by the Council of Europe, and is effective
from July 2004.
The Convention was signed by 51 countries, from which six countries are not members of the
Council of Europe and these are Australia, the Dominican Republic, Canada, Japan, South
Africa and the USA.
This Convention is one of framework conventions, which means that its provisions are not
directly applicable, but it is necessary that states implement these provisions in their own, i.e.
national legislation.
Montenegro adopted the Law on Ratification of the Convention on Cybercrime on 3rd March
2010, which entered into force on 1st July 2010. In addition, Montenegro also ratified the
Additional Protocol on Xenophobia and Racism (CETS 189) along with the Convention from
14

2013

CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY FOR MONTENEGRO 2017
3rd March 2010, which entered into force on 1st July 2010. Montenegro has signed and ratified
the Convention on Protection of Children against Sexual Exploitation and Sexual Abuse (CETS
201).
Criminal offenses indicated under this Convention as cybercrime include a wide range of
spreading viruses, unauthorized access to a computer network through piracy to
pornography and intrusion into the banking systems, abuse of credit cards and all other
criminal offences in which computers are used. Montenegrin criminal legislation complies
with the provisions of Budapest Convention.
Budapest convention stipulates that national legislations in their criminal codes are to
provide punishment for offenses related to infringement of copyright and related rights, and
liabilities assumed by the Bern Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works,
protection by the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights
(TRIPS) and World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) Copyright Treaty. Codification
of these criminal offenses in our Criminal Code has been provided in provisions related to
violation of moral rights of authors and performers, unauthorized use of copyright works and
objects, unauthorized circumvention of protection measures intended to prevent violations of
copyright and related rights, unauthorized removal or alteration of electronic information on
copyright and related right, unauthorized use of other’s patent, unauthorized use of other’s
design.
The Convention also includes liability of legal entities, and when it is translated into our
national legislation, then we can say that in 2007 Montenegro adopted the Law on liability of
legal persons for criminal offenses. Article 3 of this Law stipulates that legal entities can be
held accountable for all the criminal offences from the special section of the Criminal Code, as
well as for all other criminal offenses prescribed by a special law, provided that the conditions
for liability of legal entities prescribed by the Law on liability of legal entities for criminal
offenses have been met.
Montenegro ratified the Additional Protocol to the Convention on Cybercrime and the
Protocol involves punishment for acts of racism and xenophobia, which are made by
computer systems. This Protocol was ratified on 3rd March 2010 and entered into force on
1st July 2010. The Protocol is implemented as a separate article of the Criminal Code, which
involves instigation of national, racial and religious hatred.

15

2013

CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY FOR MONTENEGRO 2017
EU Council Framework Decision 2005/222/PUP or EURLex number 32005F0222 includes
attacks on information systems, and it has been implemented through the provisions of
Criminal Code.
In addition, a very important international source of law is the EU Council Framework
Decision 32000D0375, which was adopted on 29th May 2000. It includes combating child
pornography on the Internet and provides a number of specific measures on the aim to
prevent and combat production, processing, possession and distribution of child pornography
material and on the aim of efficiency of investigation and of criminal prosecution of offenses
from this field. Criminal Procedure Code of Montenegro provides measures for which we can
say to partially comply with this Framework Decision, and it is about the urgency of the
proceedings when these works are concerned, exclusion of public for these offenses, provided
that these are general provisions concerning procedures relating to minors.
Procedural Law
The Convention on Cybercrime also involves procedural provisions for the field of
cybercrime. The Convention recommends to States Parties to adopt all appropriate legislative
and other measures in their national legislatures in order to establish certain powers and
procedures for the punishment of criminal offenses related to cybercrime.
Montenegro adopted a new Criminal Procedure Code, which is in accordance with
international legal standards and fully or partially complied national procedural norms with
certain procedural provisions stipulated by Budapest Convention. Equally, Convention
Articles relating to evidentiary actions, secret surveillance measures and temporary seizure of
objects and confiscation measures have been implemented in our criminal Procedure Code.
Legislative framework
Legal documents that form the basis of the functioning and further development of modern
concept of information security in Montenegro:
a) Law on Ratification of the Convention on Cybercrime
b) Criminal Code
c) Criminal Procedure Code
d) Law on Information Security
16

2013

CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY FOR MONTENEGRO 2017
e) Law on the National Security Agency
f) Law on Classified Information
g) Electronic Signature Law
h) Law on Electronic Communications
i) Electronic Commerce Law

Other important documents that need to be mentioned in this chapter:
-

Study with defined responsibilities of state authorities in fight against cybercrime
including assessment of the state condition and readiness in the area of cyber security

-

Regulation on detailed conditions and method of implementing IT measures to protect
classified information (1st July 2010)

-

Regulation on detailed conditions and method of implementing measures to protect
classified information (6th November 2010)

-

Regulation on detailed conditions and method of implementing industrial measures to
protect classified information (16th December 2010)

-

Regulation on method of conducting and content of internal control over
implementation of measures to protect classified information (28th July 2010).

4.2. Accountable institutions for Montenegrin Cyber Security System
Within public administration, there must be a defined organizational hierarchy that will most
efficiently and in a long-term sustainable manner ensure the appropriate security information
management in Montenegro.

17

2013

CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY FOR MONTENEGRO 2017

Montenegro:



Ministry for Information Society and Telecommunications (National CIRT)



Ministry of Defence



Ministry of the Interior



Ministry of Justice



National Security Agency



Police Administration



Military of Montenegro

Figure 1: Position of National CIRT in Cyber Security System of Montenegro

Members of this hierarchical infrastructure are also CIRTs or similar organizational bodies
established by Internet Service Providers (ISPs), mobile operators, banks, Post Office of
Montenegro, EPCG and other companies that are interested or have significant impact on the
functioning of national information infrastructure.
CIRT has become a member of key international institutions that are relevant in the area of
cyber security, such as FIRST (Forum of Incident Response Security Teams); TRUSTED
Introducer (TERENA), ITU-IMPACT coalition. Membership in this organization provides for
CIRT to connect with other CERT/CIRT teams from around the world.

5. MAIN OBJECTIVES OF CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY FOR MONTENEGRO
Cyber Security Strategy for Montenegro contains seven key areas:
1) Defining institutional and organisational structure in the field of cyber

security in the country
Coordinated construction of organizational, institutional and management capacities,
improving laws and regulations are important items of information security existence in
Montenegro.
The formation of National Cyber Security Council means providing umbrella organisation
in the country that will advise the Government of Montenegro on all important matters
related to cybercrime. The Council will propose measures for harmonisation of legislative and
administrative framework with a view to more efficiently fight against cybercrime.
Council members are representatives of key institutions identified in the fight against
cybercrime.
Key activities:


Establishment of National Cyber Security Council



Establishment of local CIRT teams

2) Protection of critical information structures in Montenegro

Due to constant grow of the number of services that state authorities and private sector
provide to citizens as well as to other legal entities, it is necessary to define a critical
information infrastructure in Montenegro and develop protection procedures.
It is necessary to provide national cyber security and protect economic interests. Therefore,
the Government needs to provide necessary structure and resources to ensure cyber security.

20

2013

CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY FOR MONTENEGRO 2017
Key activities:


Definition and protection of critical information infrastructure



Strengthening the resilience of information systems to incidents



Perform analysis of threats to IT infrastructure

3) Strengthening capacities of state law enforcement authorities

Constant improvement of the sophistication level of cyber threats and attacks, as well as their
methods and technics require continuous strengthening of administrative capacities of a state
for the purpose of responding efficiently to a wide range of cyber threats.
Computer crime (cybercrime) and electronic evidence material require a specialized response
of criminal justice authorities. Law enforcement authorities and prosecution should be able to
conduct investigations and prosecute offences against computer data and systems, offences
committed over computers, as well as electronic evidence material relating to any criminal
offence.
Key activities:


Adopting full and effective legal solutions in the field of cybercrime, which meet the
requirements of human rights and the rule of law



Strengthening of specialised unit for fight against cybercrime within the Police
Administration



Strengthening of specialised unit for fight against cybercrime within the Military of
Montenegro



Strengthening the capacity of National Security Agency in the field of collecting,
recording, analysing, storing and exchanging data from cyberspace, and in accordance
with the Law on National Security Agency



Improving capacities for digital forensics

21

2013

CYBER SECURITY STRATEGY FOR MONTENEGRO 2017


Strengthening the capacity of prosecution in the area of cybercrime and electronic
evidence material



Support the training of judges, prosecutors and law enforcement authorities in the
field of computer crime



Promoting financial investigations and preventing fraud and money laundering on the
Internet

4) Incident Response

By establishing the National CIRT at the Ministry for Information Society and
Telecommunications, a big step has been taken towards preventing and eliminating cyber
threats that affect the state and its citizens. In cooperation with key institutions in
Montenegro, CIRT is dealing with detection, monitoring and prevention of cyber attacks and
cybercrime at the state level. CIRT represents a central point for coordinating prevention and
protection against computer security incidents on the Internet and other IT security risk for
the area of Montenegro. It is also possible to report incidents on the website www.cirt.me.
In order to respond to incident situations in the best and most efficient possible manner, it is
necessary to ensure better cooperation and free information exchange between key
institutions in the field of cyber security. This primarily relates to cooperation of key state
