NATIONAL STRATEGY
for information society development
“Digital Moldova 2020”

I. INTRODUCTION
1. The Republic of Moldova achieved significant progress in the implementation of
information society technologies, ICT contribution share to GDP in recent years has reached the
level of almost 8-10%, every second citizen is an Internet user, more than half of households
have at least one computer, the majority of connected households have access to broadband
Internet, and the country was placed among top 20 countries in the world according to Internet
access speed, the biometric passport, the ID card with electronic signature, the e-Statements
system and digital map were implemented, country joined the “Open Government Data”
initiative, the “e-Transformation” Governance project is running, etc. However, in international
classifications the country is not placed among the advanced economies in this field, and the
level and speed of information society development do not meet the current international
environment requirements, in which the world is becoming even more “hyperconnected”1
(references are presented in the Annex no 2 to the National Strategy for Information Society
Development “Digital Moldova 2020”) and more digitized.
The complex picture of today's digital world includes smart mobile devices and remote
collaborative tools, cloud computing and tremendous change of the users' behavior, especially of
the digital natives who expect services to be available anytime, anywhere and through any
device. These expectations require governments and public institutions to be prepared to provide
and use informational services anytime, anywhere and on any equipment in a safer and secured
way with fewer resources.
Advantages of digital technologies of which individuals could benefit as
citizens/consumers are reduced in many countries, including the Republic of Moldova, because
of the security and privacy issues, insufficient access to the Internet, a low degree of
functionality, lack of required competences or service accessibility.

2. Building a country’s future is unthinkable without a digital strategy that shall create
opportunities to innovate and develop based on ICT technologies, yet contractors and
government agencies to maximize the usage of government data services for the citizens’
benefit. The European Union adopted and implements „Digital Agenda for Europe” Strategy,
adjusting its priorities to the new circumstances (in December 2012 defined 7 priorities).
Countries which occupy first places in international rankings also approved digital strategies
aiming to ensure an accelerated development (USA, UK, Estonia, and Qatar, for example).
3. The National Strategy for Information Society Development “Digital Moldova 2020”
(hereinafter referred to as Strategy) is aimed to create conditions through minimum state
intervention but with maximum effect for information society development, focusing efforts on
three pillars:

-2-

1) Pillar I: Access and infrastructure – improvement of connectivity and network
access;
2) Pillar II: Digital content and electronic services- promoting digital content and
generating services;
3) Pillar II: - Capacities and utilization- strengthening literacy and digital skills to enable
innovation and stimulate usage.
These three dimensions have a major favorable impact on the following three components
of society:
a) communities/population, that shall enjoy more comfortable and better life;
b) businesses, which shall increase the level of competitiveness;
c) governance, which shall improve their performances and shall provide services to the
citizens anytime, anywhere and on any terminal equipment.
4. The Strategy implementation shall be based on core principles of modern information
society building, especially on principles of recognition of authenticity and legality of data from
electronic registers and information systems and of the electronically performed actions.
5. Strategy is enclosed by an Action Plan for implementation of the National Strategy for
Information Society Development “Digital Moldova 2020” (annex to this Strategy), which sets
out the actions and programs meant to achieve the general objective of building an advanced
Information Society and the economy based on knowledge, and the integrating horizontally the
priorities as well.

II. CURRENT STATE OF THINGS
2.1. Progress

[

6. Even if less than a half of 177 actions of the National Strategy for Information Society
Action Plan „Electronic Moldova” (2005) directives were fulfilled, this document had a major
role in creating a favorable framework or information society technologies development and for
preparing the ground for next stages. The implementation of the Strategy and the eSEE Agenda
provisions resulted in tangible outcomes. During 2005-2011, various sources allocations for
informatization increased substantially and reached approximately 5.36 billion lei.
7. The penetration of Mobile telephony exceeded 119% (EU average – 128%)2, broadband
Internet at fixed locations reached a penetration level of 11.72% (EU average – 27.2%),
broadband mobile Internet – modems/cards – 4.7% (EU average – 7.5%)3.
More than a half of population are using the Internet, more than a half of households have
at least one computer connected to Internet, half of the population read newspapers online, but
only one out of 10 users accesses the government web site (www.gov.md) and only one out of
20 users has accessed at least one electronic public service in the past 12 months. 8 out of 10
Internet users access social networks4.
8. The necessary legislative and normative framework was created, which currently
includes about 20 laws, 80 Government decisions, about 70 approved conceptual documents
regarding the informational systems of public authorities, more than 20 general purpose
regulatory acts and 75 with a specific purpose issued by the National Regulatory Agency for
Electronic Communications and Information Technology. The Institutional framework was
improved through the creation of the Ministry of Information Technology and Communications
and of the specialized institutions such as the Centre for Electronic Governance and National
Center for Personal Data Protection. In 2011 the Technological Transformation Strategic
Program of governance “e-Transformation” was adopted, supported by the World Bank.

-3-

9. The online fiscal declarations systems, biometric passport, automated biometric border
crossing systems based on electronic passports, Moldova digital map, mobile digital signature
and online services as: e-Police Clearance Certificate, e-Licensing, etc. were implemented. The
Interoperability framework based on the open standards and cloud computing based services is
actually in the process of implementation.
10. Despite the progress in a number of indicators, Moldova is placed far behind the
countries that are among the leaders in terms of implementation and use of ICT.
In international ranking according to the level of ICT development (IDI), Moldova ranks
62nd out of 155 countries (4th position among CIS countries)5 and at the e-Governance
Development Index (e-GRI) ranks 69th out of 159 countries, advancing 11 positions compared to
2010, but it is still on the last place among the countries of Eastern Europe6. According to the
Global Competitiveness Report 2012-20137, where, according to the Index of Internet
penetration in schools (KEI), Moldova is placed on 61st position out of 144 countries. In
Training Network Index (NRI) the Republic of Moldova is placed on 78th position out of 142
countries (Picture 1).

Although the progress dynamics of electronic readiness is quite impressive, the Republic
of Moldova falls behind as compared to the EU Member States as well as to the neighboring
countries: Romania and Ukraine.
The success of the Republic of Moldova Information Society future development mainly
depends on the country's ability to overcome the key obstacles that currently hampers its forward
development.
2.2. International decisions
11. In 2010, the European Council and Parliament adopted the Digital Agenda for Europe
as a part of the Europe 2020 Strategy for boosting digital economy and tackling societal
challenges8 by means of ICT.
On December 18, 2012, the European Commission adopted new priorities for digital
economy and society. The growth rate registered by the digital economy is seven times higher
than the rest of the economy9, but this potential is currently dimmed by a fragmentation of policy
framework at pan-European level. The adopted priorities are the result of an extensive review of
the policies, and additionally outline the elements with the highest transformation potential of the
initial version of the Digital Agenda for Europe 2010.
Full implementation of the updated Digital Agenda shall require the European GDP
growth of 5% or 1500 Euro per capita over the next eight years by increasing the ICT
investments, improving the computer skills levels of the workforce, facilitating public sector
innovation and reforming the framework conditions for the Internet-based economy.

-4-

South Korea, etc.);
4) New Education Code is under development.

The strategic approach consists of using advantages, overcoming weaknesses by
transforming opportunities into advantages and mitigating the identified risks and threats.

III. DEFINITION OF THE PROBLEMS
3.1. Unoptimized infrastructure and irregular access
14. The main access and penetration indices:
1) mobile telephony – 119,7% (covering – 99% of the territory / EU – 128%);
2) fixed telephony – 33,87% / EU – 43%;
3) broadband fixed Internet – 11,72% / EU-27,2%;
4) Internet via mobile networks (modems/cards) – 4,7% / EU-7,5%;
5) households broadband Internet connection – 35%;
These indices confirm a substantial gap in comparison with the EU countries average. The
difference is due to the investments which have been made in the redundant infrastructures with
a low use of existing capacities.

t

15. The limited access (especially by prices) to the associated infrastructure (mainly to
ducts) of the historical operator restricts the access of other operators, thus installation of the
overhead cables being a cheaper solution. In most cases associated infrastructure (pillars, ducts,
etc.) is not divided, fact that leads to a longer investments return period and high network
maintenance costs, and therefore restrict technological development opportunities and increase
prices levels for the final users.
A long-run solution is needed to streamline the existing associated administrative
infrastructure that shall be proposed based on a detailed analysis of the options, including the
separation of infrastructure entity from the retail service providers.

16. Although the Republic of Moldova is among the top 20 countries in the world by
Internet access speed10, the broadband connectivity required to meet present and future needs of
the country isn’t available throughout the entire territory of the country. About 30% of rural
areas still do not have broadband access.
17. Because of the construction industry regulations focused on a single provider of
electronic communications services, apartment buildings have not set distribution
channels/networks for Internet access and in some blocks are installed a significant number of
cables, which deteriorates the interior and exterior aspect of the buildings.
3.2. Underdeveloped local digital content and the low availability of electronic
services
18. According to the annual national survey 2012 “the perception, assimilation and support
by the population of the e-Government transformation”, conducted in November 2012 by the
Institute for Public Policy and Magenta, upon the request of the Center for Electronic
Governance: 16% of users practice electronic commerce, 8% use Internet banking services.
About 63% of the users download digital content, 33% use Internet for education and training,
16% execute procurement and command of some services provided by privet institutions and
access web pages of the central public institutions, while only 1 out of 20 uses Internet for
accessing electronic public services.

-8-

19. Digital content and services are key factors that offer benefits to society and the
economy of any country and represent a major source of potential workplaces and economic
growth.
There is no universally accepted definition of digital content. For example, one of them
states that the digital content is any information that is available on the Internet (or other
networks) to be reached by the user, including web pages, images, music, audio and video
documents, books, drivers and software downloads, and reference materials for education and
training11.
This Strategy defines the digital content as any information in electronic format submitted
to the following processes: creation, collection, management, processing, storage, distribution,
access, use and re-use, abolition.
The most important content for the users is usually that which is in their native language
and relevant to the communities in which they live and work. UNESCO has defined “the local
content" as “the expression and communication of a community’s locally generated, owned and
adapted, knowledge and experience that is relevant to the community’s situation” (UNESCO,
2001).
20. The citizens of the Republic of Moldova face a shortage of local digital content and a
low number of electronic services.
Thus, few services out of about 570 public government services are offered through
Internet (only 5 out of 12 online basic public services for citizens, and 6 out of 8 – for economic
agents12). Starting from September 2012 to present, within the framework of the e-Government
Transformation Project were launched e-Application for criminal record, e-Licensing (connected
to the mobile signature), electronic reporting to e-CNAM and e-CNAS (connected to mobile
signature), e-DNC (Normative Documents in Constructions www.ednc.gov.md), SIA “the state
register of public acquisitions” services. At the same time, in February 2013, was officially
launched the M-Cloud common government technology platform, the digitization of the Civil
status service archive is in the process of implementation, SIGEDI is implemented in 9
ministries. Recently the State Fiscal Service and Center for Electronic Governance through the
medium of SE “Fiscservinform” optimized the process of submitting statements concerning the
income tax for physical persons, connecting it to the mobile signature. Other 7 e-services should
be launched during 2013 within the frameworks of the projects managed by the Center for
Electronic Governance.

21. The Republic of Moldova demand for broadband networks was caused mainly by
downloading movies and music via data exchange systems peer-to-peer (Torrents) and by using
Skype, social networks “Odnoklassniki”, “Facebook”, “Netlog”, “YouTube” etc. The social
network “Odnoklassniki.ru” is the most visited site among the Internet users of the Republic of
Moldova13. Accessing mostly foreign information resources, the users of the Republic of
Moldova outline the low shortage of internal resources. In order to generate more the local
digital content, it is necessary to provide conditions and mechanisms for content managers,
including intensive use of open data opportunities.
22. Cultural and scientific heritage is not yet digitalized. The national program of
informatization of the cultural domain for 2012-202014 was approved only in 2012. Although,
the measures to digitize the values of other areas are taken15, assessment actions and
interventions measures are required to speed up the process.
23. The legal and regulatory framework is not yet completely adjusted to the new realities
of the digital environment, especially regarding the proportional wide use of new information
technologies and insuring an adequate level of intellectual property protection16.
24. The Interoperability Framework Program approved by the Government in September
201217 is on the beginning of implementation and the citizen is required to submit copies of a

-9-

given number of documents (identity acts, certificates, etc.) – each time when requests services
or concludes various acts, even if it is addressed repeatedly to the same public institution. This
drives to time mismanagement, waste of paper and other materials and therefore unnecessary
costs, negative environmental impact and inefficiency of the institutions’ activity.
25. There is no digital content management framework during its life cycle that would
ensure that the national historic content and the newly created one to be available, accessible,
distributed, understandable, used and improved. Providing simple access to this content requires
a comprehensive framework that shall cover all management and decision aspects throughout the
digital lifecycle. Enriching the content increases the number and quality of services meant for
citizens.
26. The Republic of Moldova public institutions data are stored/handled in about 150 data
centers, most of which do not correspond to the security conditions, durability and reliability and
do not have enough qualified staff to keep them in good conditions. Besides the risks of losing
information from these centers, the annual cost of their maintenance is about 150 million lei18,
which indicates an inefficient expenditure of public money.
27. Access to content and services through the electronic signature. Although the Law on
electronic document and digital signature is into force since 2004, the digital signature is rarely
used. Nevertheless, the process of issuing public key certificates issued by the SE. “Center of
Special Telecommunications” over the last period increases, these may be used in all existing
electronic systems. .

f

t

28. The Mobile Electronic Signature launched in September 2012 places Moldova among
the top seven countries in the world that also implements such innovative technology and the use
of this tool shall safely boost access to the available electronic services. The Electronic Identity
Cards, which shall be implemented, shall facilitate the access to electronic services. If there are
more digital identity owners, the digital identity management becomes an important factor for
the functionality of infrastructure and access to digital content/services.

29. Although 37,7% of the country's Internet user’s make on-line purchases19, these
procurements are mainly from abroad, even with the existing technological infrastructure, ecommerce in the Republic of Moldova is still undeveloped because of the low number of
services that accept online payments. However, some abroad, popular e-commerce portals do not
support Moldova's inclusion in the list of countries from which they accept Internet payments
and send goods and online software20. Republic of Moldova remains a cash-based economy
(cards issued by the banks of the Republic of Moldova are mostly used for cash withdrawals – 87
percent of card holders’ cash and 97,7 percent out of the total value of operations realized in the
Republic of Moldova)21. As rated by the World Bank, the biggest drawback of electronic
payments is the lack of trust and comprehension shown by the society22.
However, there is an increasing trend concerning the number of electronic shops, and online electronic payment instruments are deployed, Law no.114 from 18.05.2012 on payment
services and electronic money was adopted23. A number of banks have established Internet
payment mechanisms for services, airline tickets commerce, discount cards, books, etc.24 The
official inclusion of the Republic of Moldova in the group Europe II was officially declared in
august 2012, which abolished the previously existing restrictions and allowed not only sending
but also receiving payments, thus, the citizens of the Republic of Moldova may buy products
from online stores25.
30. Measuring the volume of digital content is troublesome because of the lack of direct
indicators. The empirical research of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD)26 shows that there is a strong correlation between the network
infrastructure development and the growth of the local content volume. The significant statistical
correlation is evident by using different indirect measurements of local content, such as: number

- 10 -

of visible top-level domains by using country code per capita; Wikipedia articles in state
language per capita, blogs per capita, and Internet Development Indicators (broadband
penetration rates, autonomous information systems per capita, international bandwidth per
capita, number of IPv4 addresses per capita). In international reports27, the content accessibility
rate is calculated according to the agreed algorithms and countries are rated according to the
values of this indicator .
The Republic of Moldova's position is quite weak in terms of online promotion. The
number of web-generic top-level domains per 1000 people in the Republic of Moldova is only
2.0 units compared to 2.9 units/1000 in the CIS and 22.3/1,000 in Central and East Europe
(CEE)28. This speaks about a low presence of local companies and organizations on the Internet,
which is a gap for promoting local digital content and domestic products.
3.3. Low level of "digital literacy" and insufficient use
31. According to the Global IT Report 2012, in terms of people’s skills, the Republic of
Moldova was assessed with 5 points out of 7 possible (65th place out of 142). If in terms of the
digital literacy the country is ranked 44th and in terms of education in mathematics and science is
ranked 69th (4 points out of 7 possible)29, then by the educational system quality, the Republic of
Moldova is ranked 102nd with 3.2 points out of 7 possible, which is among the last 40 countries
included in the report30, which is a matter of concern. Only 14% of population aged between 3544 years and 10% of the population aged between 45 and 54 years are Internet users31.
The Republic of Moldova, as well as all Europe, faces an increase of the ICT skills gap and
a low level of the digital literacy. These drawbacks have consequences like the insufficient use
of the benefits granted by Information Society and even the exclusion of many citizens from the
ICT-based society and economy. On the other side, although the citizens have computers and are
Internet users, many of them do not know even the ICT terminology32, not to mention the entire
use of the benefits offered by the ICT.
A large part of the Republic of Moldova population does not possess digital knowledge
and skills; this fact reduces the opportunities to participate in the global digital economy.

[

f

t

32. The digital literacy of the population starts from the general education system and
mainly due to:
1) Curriculum adjusted to the economic needs based on knowledge;
2) Teaching staff trained in efficient application of ICT in the educational process;
3) Integration of information technology in the didactic process;
4) Creation of the digital educational contents, including education support throughout the
life.
33. Even though, during the previous years have been undertaken efforts by the
Government in order to implement ICT in general education (800 computer classes in 1997, the
"SALT" program, financial resources to open at least one computer class in every school, the
broadband Internet access and procurement of didactic software), these are not completely
integrated into the didactic process.
Although the equipping level of general educational institutions increased, there is a lack
of management, maintenance and budgeting for computer laboratories and the majority of the
proprietary software programs are not licensed, at the same time the open software is poorly
used. Some sections of the ICT curriculum are outdated and there is no institutionalized process
for its periodical updating.
Graduates of educational institutions do not possess sufficient practical skills to work in an
information society.
There is a shortage of qualified staff: half of computer science teachers have education in
the exact science area and only 3 out of 10 of them graduated computer science. Most of the

- 11 -

didactic staffs that teach computer science and other disciplines have never attended training
courses and have not acquired teaching degrees. A lot of teachers do not possess general
computer skills (email, Internet, etc.), and even fewer of them are able to use ICT in teaching
process. School teachers of the main scholar disciplines (except those 140 schools equipped with
educational software) have no educational software and have not been trained to handle such
software. Although there is an increase of applications using ICT in school and university
subjects, most of the school subjects have no dedicated educational software.
The most skilled in ICT teaching are not drawn to higher education because of
uncompetitive salaries, lack of a performance based management, motivation system and
professional development, and the education governance is confused (occupational standards are
missing, professional formation is directed by supply and not by demand, qualifications are
granted by the educational institutions in the absence of an explicit legal and normative
framework that would ensure the involvement of companies in this process, educational
institutions do not respond to the features of the graduate’s professional paths and other.
Nomenclature of the professional formation area and staff training specialties in higher education
institution and in Qualification framework fail to satisfy the existing market demand. Evaluation
systems of higher education institutions performances are not oriented to the EQF (European
Qualification Framework).
Internet admission system in the institutions of higher education is not implemented in the
Republic of Moldova. Although some universities have implemented information management
systems for certain processes and developed electronic courses, not having approved the
regulatory framework for distance learning, universities do not apply such mechanisms.
Electronic educational services from which people could benefit are only online published
lessons without the application of online evaluation mechanisms.
There is a huge brain drain to large international companies from this field. Through the
legislative support of the ICT business environment, it is possible to encourage large
international companies to use ICT human resources directly in the Republic of Moldova and to
encourage valuable professionals to remain in Moldova33.

34. According to the International Communication Union (ITU) Report 201234, by the use
of sub-index, Moldova ranked only number 79, although it has achieved some progress
regarding indicators that form this sub-index (adults’ digital literacy rate – 98.5%, population
with secondary education rate – 88,0%, and the rate of population with higher education –
38,1%). According to the Global IT Report 2012, the level of ICT use is also low – only 3,2
points out of 7 possible (place 90th out of 142nd )35. The lowest level of use is observed in
business environment – 3,0 points out of 7 (120th out of 142nd), and governmental use is at 3,5
points out of 7 (94th out of 142nd). By the level of e-participation Moldova was ranked 38 out of
125 countries36.
The Insufficient use is due to the small number of online services and low level of digital
skills of the public institutions employees. Although the Academy of Public Administration uses
Methodological Norms for ICT training and online training tools implemented with the support
of UNDP, these instruments have not been used widely because there is no express provision in
normative acts that would require digital skills for employment in a public institution.
3.4. Increasing the danger of cybercrime and risk of low trust in networks and online
services
35. The more a society is computerized the more it is exposed to cybernetic attacks, and
the ensuring of cyberspace security should be a major concern of all stakeholders, especially at
the institutional level, which are responsible for coherent policy development and
implementation in the field.
Cyber security means the state of normality resulted from application of a set of proactive

- 12 -

and reactive measures that ensure confidentiality, integrity, availability, authenticity and nonrepudiation of e-information, public and private resources and services in cyberspace.
Globality of cyberspace is able to increase the risks both for private and public sectors.
Cyber threats are materialized through the exploitation of human, technical and procedural
nature weaknesses, most often in:
1) cyber-attacks against the infrastructure that maintain public functions or services of the
information society which disruption/damage could be a threat to national security;
2) unauthorized access to cyber infrastructure;
3) unauthorized modification, deletion or damage of information data or illegal access
restriction to these data;
4) cyber espionage;
5) causing a loss of property, harassment and blackmail of individuals and legal entities, in
the public and private sectors.
The Origin of Hacks Report identifies 981 million hacking attempts worldwide during the
third quarter of 2012, with an increase of 23 million compared with the number identified in the
second quarter37. The first four top countries in the ranking of the hacker attacks’ origin are the
USA, Russia, China and Ukraine. Romania was ranked 7th in this top.
Attacks may be politically motivated, as proven by cyber-attacks against Estonia,
Lithuania and Georgia38 or electoral - attacks on Central Election Commission of the Republic of
Moldova servers on parliamentary election day in 2010. Over 44 million cyber-attacks on Israel
government websites were registered between 14 and 19 November 2012, when Israel forces
began an offensive in Gaza39.
Being situated territorially between 2 of the top 10 countries, which generate cyber-attacks,
Moldova is subjected to major risks of new forms of “cyber” crime. In fact, thanks to the
Internet, we can say that all the countries are neighbors in the sense of cyber threats.

36. The Republic of Moldova has ratified the Council of Europe Convention on Cyber
crime, adopted in Budapest on November 23rd, 200140. The law on preventing and fighting
cybercrime was implemented and adopted41, it regulates the legal relations on preventing and
fighting cyber crimes; the protection and aid delivery to service providers and information
systems users; the public administration collaboration with other representatives of civil society
in preventing and fighting cybercrime; the cooperation with other states, international and
regional organizations.
Currently, in the Republic of Moldova there is no public authority directly liable and
empowered with rights, functions and duties on cyber security. At this moment, there are several
institutions involved in this process, each of them providing coverage for this issue on their
business segment. Thus, the existing gap is to be covered by the legislative and regulatory
framework in the field of cyber security.
Being aware of the risks and threats to which the carried on activities are exposed in the
cyberspace and of the means to prevent and counterattack them requires an effective
communication and cooperation between specific stakeholders in this realm.
From this view, there is a need to develop a culture of the cyber security of the information
and communications systems users, which are often poorly informed about the potential risks,
and solutions against them.

[

37. Nowadays, the Internet has become an important information infrastructure for the
citizens and for the economy in general, that the ability to resist a multitude of new threats to IT
systems and networks is important for users to feel comfortable and safe when connecting
online. Just as in the real world, the cybercrime cannot be tolerated. Up till now the Internet has
proven to be very safe, strong and reliable, IT networks and end-users terminals remain to be
vulnerable to a wide range of new threats: in recent years Unsolicited electronic messages

- 13 -

(SPAM) disturbed to Internet e-mail traffic congestion - according to various statistics, from the
total amount of messages in circulation - 80 to 98% of all messages are unsolicited electronic
messages (SPAM)42 – spreading a multitude of viruses and malicious software. In the Republic
of Moldova, for example, only during the period 17 May - 21 November 2012, within the total
amount of electronic messages sent to the central public administration authorities, only about
986,500 were legitimate messages, while more than about 8.5 million were spam messages that
contained 874 detected viruses43. It follows that Moldova is in the same situation regarding spam
as the entire Europe44.
The scourge of identity theft and online fraud is ongoing. Attacks are becoming
increasingly sophisticated (trojans, botnets, etc.) and more difficult to identify and destroy: a
good example is the virus “Red October”45. Attacks are often motivated by financial purposes.
Although there are technical means, nowadays there are no legally binding provisions for
reporting information to Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT-GOV-MD)46 and this
entity has no special liabilities or sufficient capacity to meet the new challenges at the national
level. According to the provisions of the objective nr.1.5.5 of the Individual Partnership Action
Plan of the Republic of Moldova – NATO, approved by the Government Decision nr.746 from
August 18, 2010, the CERT-GOV-MD is the unique point of access for the users of automated
information systems of national importance. This shall ensure the consolidation of the authorities
and institutions’ efforts for the attainment of an informed and reciprocally coordinated reaction
in the cyber security threats area.

V. ASSESSMENT OF THE IMPACT AND COSTS
45. The Strategy implementation shall have a positive impact on citizens, business
environment and government and shall lead to the accelerated development of the Information
Society in the Republic of Moldova, improving the ICT inclusion into society, providing a new
quality of economic growth, based on knowledge, human capital, and shall improve the citizens’
quality of life
The impact of the Strategy implementation shall occur in:
1) streamlining the act of governance ;

- 20 -

2) improving the services for population and business environment;
3) diminishing corruption;
4) increasing the economic competitiveness.
Therefore, the large scale implementation of the public institutions interoperability shall
cause a significant increase of productivity over time.
A 10 percentage points’ increase of the digitization level reduces the unemployment rate
by 0.84% and contributes to a six-percentage points’ increase of the country's score in the Global
Innovation Index.
By 2020, the Republic of Moldova shall benefit from ICT solutions for all the components
of the society (the population, the economy, the state). The use of ICT shall also contribute to a
deeper integration into the global economy, promotion of its own information products and
services all around the world and the citizens shall have a high level of wellbeing.
46. The strategy involves the allocation of a significant amount of financing during the
entire period of implementation (2013-2020). The financial costs are approximate calculations
developed during the actions planning phase, when an accurate assessment of the funding is not
possible for justified reasons.
During the development processes of programs and projects for the implementation of the
Strategy shall be attracted internal and external public and private funds. National resources
funds shall come from:
1) the funds allocated /approved for the institutions involved in the implementation of the
Strategy;
2) the state programs for technological development and innovation area;
3) the technological transfer projects with mandatory private sector co-financing;
4) the public-private partnerships.
Determination of priority actions and their financing by means of including in the strategic
costs plan shall be done according to the institutional financing amount and expenditures ceiling
set out by the in force Medium-Term Budget Framework, and the annual financing of the actions
shall be carried on within the approved national budget allocations for each sector and/or
additional sources.
As appropriate, when it is required the achievement of mandatory but financially
uncovered measures, additional funding sources identification is to be started.
The "e-transformation" project, funded from the World Bank loan, shall continue to be
implemented.
For further funding of the development of information society building shall be attracted
international funds, especially the European ones. The European integration potential in research
and innovation shall be used in order to stimulate country’s economic growth by attending a
series of EU funding programs.
