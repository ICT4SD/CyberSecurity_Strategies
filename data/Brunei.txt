WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD? WHAT DOES THE FUTURE HOLD? 
• 
Brunei economic future lies in its economic diversification 
• 
ICT sector had been identified as one of the key driver in Brunei economic 
development. 
• 
e-Government is not merely introducing technology for efficiency; instead it 
is a transformation process that involves changing the mindset of the people, 
culture and structure 
• 
e-Government is about restructuring and reengineering of government 
business processes, the need to change their thinking and "accept the e-ways“ 
• 
The implementation of e-Government program for example helps to expedite 
the operational processes through the reduction of repetitive administrative 
and manual tasks. 
• 
Success and failure of e-Government will be much more visible when online 
governance and services meets the public (such as public participations) 
• 
e-Government require ICT capacity and capability, Business Process Re-
engineering, change of mindset, close and cohesive cooperation/collaboration 
among various stakeholders that include the support and involvement from 
top management to the bottom of the organizational ladder.
