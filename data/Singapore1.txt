NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY MASTERPLAN 2018 / 3

Introduction

Brief History of
the Masterplans

The cyber landscape evolves rapidly, and so too must
Singapore’s efforts to foster a secure and resilient
national infocomm environment.

Singapore’s Infocomm Security
Masterplans are reviewed every 3 – 5
years. This ensures that Singapore
continues to be a secure and trusted

Since 2005, infocomm security masterplans have
provided Singapore with strategic directions in securing
its infocomm environment, while taking a balanced
approach between security requirements and ease of
conducting business or daily activities. The National
Cyber Security Masterplan 2018 (NCSM2018) is the
latest five-year plan to enhance the cyber security of
Singapore’s public, private and people sectors. In addition
to Government and Critical Infocomm Infrastructure
(CII), its scope has now been broadened to take into
consideration businesses and individuals.

Infocomm Security
Masterplan 2 (2008-2012)

The first Infocomm Security
Masterplan (ISMP) initiated
Singapore’s concerted efforts
towards a secured infocomm
environment by first making
the Government’s infocomm
environment more secure.

In 2008, the ISMP was succeeded
by a second Masterplan (MP2),
a five-year roadmap that built
upon the achievements of its
predecessor and expanded
coverage to include Critical
Infocomm Infrastructure (CII) to
make Singapore a ‘Secure and
Trusted Hub’.

Strategic Drivers
Focus group
discussions were
held with companies
such as Microsoft,
Symantec, McAfee
and associations
such as SITF, AISP,
(ISC)2 to identify the
strategic directions
for NCSM2018

The National Cyber Security Masterplan
(NCSM2018) builds on the work undertaken
in the earlier masterplans. It seeks to
bring Singapore’s infocomm security to the
next level of maturity and sophistication.
In addition to Government and CII, the
NCSM2018 will expand its scope to cover
the wider infocomm ecosystem, including
businesses and individuals.
In order to craft a holistic strategy, IDA
conducted extensive consultation and
gathered feedback from the industry through
numerous avenues, such as focus group
discussions and IDA’s annual Business
Infocomm Usage Survey. In total, over 60
agencies, local enterprises and industry
associations were consulted for ideas
and input for the masterplan. From the
feedback, strategic drivers were identified
which served as the basis for NCSM2018.

Rising Sophistication of Cyber Threats
With an ever-increasing number of threats
and adversaries, the cyber environment
is a volatile one. The advancements in
ICT have also created more pathways for
malicious actors to exploit.

Cyber attacks have also become more
sophisticated, with social engineering1
and spear phishing2 attacks becoming
commonplace. According to the Symantec
Internet Security Threat Report, an
average of 83 spear phishing attacks
occurred each day globally in 2013.

The malware industry continues to thrive.
In Q1 2014 alone, McAfee reported more
than 30 million new malware samples in
their database. In addition, Distributed
Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks continue
to disrupt organisations and businesses. In
March 2013, anti-spamming organisation
Spamhaus was hit by one of the biggest
DDoS attacks thus far, peaking at 300
Gigabits per second.

An even greater menace has arrived in
the form of Advanced Persistent Threats
(APTs)3, featuring highly sophisticated and
targeted malware such as Stuxnet and
Duqu. APTs can circumvent typical cyber
security measures and have compromised
organisations thought to be better
equipped to defend against them, such
as network security company RSA and
defence contractor Lockheed Martin.

Social engineering,
in the context of
information security,
refers to psychological
manipulation
of people into
performing actions or
divulging confidential
information.

Spear Phishing is a
way of attempting to
acquire information
by masquerading as
a trustworthy source
in an electronic
communication.

3
An advanced
persistent threat (APT)
is a targeted attack in
which an unauthorized
person gains access
to a network and stays
there undetected for a
long period of time.

6 / NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY MASTERPLAN 2018

Supply Chain as Conduits to
Attack High Value Targets
Cyber security is only as strong as its
weakest link. Increasingly, small and
medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) are
being exploited and used as conduits
to attack higher-value targets in their
supply chain.

NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY MASTERPLAN 2018 / 7

A 2013 report by Symantec revealed that
41% of targeted attacks were aimed at
small companies, more than double the
number in 2011. The 2012 Verizon Data
Breach Investigations report also found
that a majority of the 855 data breaches
it had analysed targeted smaller firms. In
2012, Verizon itself made headlines when
a hacker stole and posted 300,000 of its
customer records on the Internet. The

data had been stolen from a third-party
marketing firm that Verizon used. In
Singapore, it was reported in December
2013 that information belonging to nearly
650 private banking customers were
stolen after the vendor contracted by the
bank to print statements was hacked.
Another form of supply chain hacking
was to attack the firms providing
protection, such as the March 2011

attack on RSA that was subsequently
used to infiltrate the Virtual Private
Networks of American defence company
Lockheed Martin. In February 2013,
security firm Bit9 was similarly hacked
and its encryption keys were used to
send malware to its clients, among which
included the U.S. government and at
least 30 Fortune 100 firms. Supply chains
thus represent an extension of the attack
surface of high value targets.

Guided by NCSM2018, the government
will work closely with the private and
people sectors, further upgrading and
strengthening cyber security capabilities
to ensure that Singapore will be able to
deal with cyber threats effectively.

The NCSM2018’s mission is to enhance
Singapore’s cyber security capabilities
in four focal areas – Government,
Critical Infocomm Infrastructure (CII),
Businesses and Individuals.

ES

The growth of mobile infocomm
technology has created a paradigm
shift in how people engage with digital
information. Many users are now used to
accessing data and infocomm services
anywhere, anytime. This has spurred
the adoption of Bring-Your-Own-Device
(BYOD)4 policies by businesses and
organisations. Mobile malware has also
risen substantially as hackers turn their
attention towards the increasing number
of mobile device users.

NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY MASTERPLAN 2018 / 13

Enhance security and
resilience of CII to deal
with sophisticated attacks
New and sophisticated threats, such as
APTs, complicate the task of prevention.
Hence, there is a need to enhance the
security and resilience of CII to deal with
such sophisticated attacks.

Critical infocomm infrastructure
As part of the continuous efforts to
enhance the protection of critical
infocomm infrastructure (CII) and
improve cross-sector response to
mitigate widespread cyber attacks, the
Government works closely with critical
sectors on cyber security exercises, as
well as to assess critical infrastructure
for vulnerabilities and ensure that
security capabilities and measures are
in place to mitigate cyber threats.
The Critical Infocomm Infrastructure
(CII) Protection Assessment programme
assesses the security of infocomm
systems that are critical to the operation
of CII in Singapore, ensuring that CIIs
remain secure and resilient.

The Critical Infocomm Infrastructure
Security Assessment (CII-SA)
appraises the infocomm security
readiness of Singapore’s Critical
Infocomm Infrastructure (CII) and
ascertains the adequacy of infocomm
protection measures, implemented by
infrastructure owners and operators.
The Secure and Resilient Internet
Infrastructure Code of Practice
(SRII-CoP), aligned with international
standards and best practices, has been
issued by IDA to designated ISPs. The
Code of Practice has been incorporated
into the telecommunications regulatory
framework and sets specific security
controls and outcomes to ensure that
essential security is maintained to
mitigate current and emerging cyber
threats. Periodic audits are conducted by
IDA to ensure that ISPs observe the Code
of Practice.
The National Cyber Security Exercise
programme uses exercises to assess
the capability and readiness of critical
sectors, aiming to improve the overall
resilience of our national infrastructure
and services to significant cyber attacks
at the national level.

Government
As part of the continuous efforts to
enhance the security and resilience of
its infocomm infrastructure, and public
sector capabilities, the Government will
focus on proactive defence-in-depth
to mitigate increasingly sophisticated
attacks. These include upgrading
of existing detection and analysis
capabilities and strengthening preventive
and recovery measures at the Whole-ofGovernment level.

The enhanced Cyber Watch Centre
(CWC) will leverage on advanced tools
and techniques, better detection and
correlation to improve the overall
effectiveness of security monitoring for
the public sector.
The enhanced Threat Analysis Centre
(TAC) will utilise state-of-the-art
analytical tools to assess larger volumes
of data from a wider range of sources,
to provide public agencies with detailed
cyber threat analysis, advisories and
recommendations so that they can take
timely preventive actions.

14 / NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY MASTERPLAN 2018

NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY MASTERPLAN 2018 / 15

Increase efforts to promote adoption
of infocomm security measures
among individuals and businesses
Due to the inter-connectivity forged
through infocomm technologies,
cyber attacks could potentially ripple
beyond the immediate victims amongst
businesses and individuals given their
roles as supply chain and employees
respectively.

SMEs and individuals are perceived
to have weaker capabilities and lower
resistance to cyber attacks. This is of
particular concern as SMEs comprise
99% of all enterprises in Singapore, as
at Aug 2014. As such, current efforts
will be reinforced to raise infocomm
security awareness and adoption among
businesses and individuals.

The Cyber Security Awareness and
Outreach programme aims to augment
existing outreach channels and explore
new avenues that offer wider coverage and
reach to users, such as broadcast media.

real-life crime cases. This will give
viewers a better understanding of cyber
threats such as identity theft and social
engineering and encourage them to
adopt safe online practices.

For example, cyber security awareness
videos in both English and Mandarin
could be uploaded onto popular video
sharing websites. Winning videos from the
National Infocomm Security Competition’s
Multimedia Design segment will also be
shown on local television channels to
promote cyber security best practices.
Cybercrime cases will be featured in
Crimewatch, a regular public education
television programme that re-enacts

In addition, the NCSM2018 will also include
initiatives to facilitate information sharing
between the Government and private
sector, as well as collaborations with
industry and trade associations to promote
cyber security. Information such as
security advisories and threat information
can be shared to enhance businesses’
ability to assess risks, make security
investments and take protective actions.

16 / NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY MASTERPLAN 2018

NATIONAL CYBER SECURITY MASTERPLAN 2018 / 17

Grow Singapore’s
Pool of Infocomm
Security Experts
The threat posed by increasingly
sophisticated cyber attacks is
exacerbated by a shortage of highly
skilled defenders. This shortage is not
unique to Singapore. More than half
(56%) of the respondents in the 2013
Global Information Security Workforce
Study (GISWS) indicated that their
security functions were short-staffed.
There is a pressing need to explore
new initiatives to boost the numbers
and skill levels of cyber security
professionals, as well as to retain
them in Singapore.
To alleviate this situation, the
NCSM2018 will push further to develop
human and intellectual capital within
Singapore’s infocomm industry.

As of 2013, the
number of cyber
security professionals
comprised less than 1%
of the total infocomm
industry workforce in
Singapore

Promotion of R&D to attract and
cultivate more cyber security
expertise
The National Cybersecurity R&D
Programme seeks to develop R&D
expertise in cyber security and improve
cyber infrastructure with an emphasis on
security, reliability, resiliency and usability.
The programme, involving NRF, MINDEF,
MHA, NSCS, IDA and EDB, aims to promote
collaboration among agencies, academia,
research institutes and private sector.
A 5-year S$130 million fund has been
committed to support research efforts into
both technological and human-science
aspects of cyber security, complemented
by studies into cyberspace governance
and policy research.

TRAINING PROGRAMME to develop
Infocomm Security Specialists
The Company-Led Training (CLT)
Programme for Fresh Professionals
is an initiative by IDA, in collaboration
with CLT Partners. CLT aims to recruit,
mentor and train fresh professionals
in areas and technologies relevant to
the local infocomm industry, including
Software Security Administration,
which is essential to an organisation’s
cyber security.
Currently, various infocomm security
companies provide in-house training for
entrant-level professionals, and some
have indicated a willingness to train
these professionals beyond their own
needs. CLT thus aims to fast-track fresh
infocomm security professionals toward
specialist-level jobs.

Trainees will receive fundamental
training in infocomm security in the
CLT Partner’s business unit. This offers
them the opportunity to apply what
they have learned and recommend
solutions in live projects. Feedback will
be provided by mentors and the training
duration will span up to a year.

CYBER TRAINING FACILITY for testing /
training of cyber security experts
The DigiSAFE Cyber Security Centre,
officially opened in June 2014, offers
highly sophisticated operations-centric
cyber security training that better
prepares cyber security professionals
in detecting and responding to
cyber attacks. The Centre’s training
programmes allow trainees to experience
realistic simulations of real-world
malicious attacks.

Strategic
Collaborations
National-Level
Committee

The importance of a collaborative
approach towards cyber security
cannot be overstated, as it
enables the pooling and sharing
of resources and knowledge
across different entities to
achieve greater synergy and more
refined solutions. In Singapore,
domestic collaboration spanning
across government agencies,
and between the government and
private sector, is complemented
by conscientious efforts to engage
other countries in international
collaborations.

The National Infocomm Security
Committee (NISC) comprises of senior
leadership from multiple government
agencies including the Agency for
Science, Technology and Research
(A*STAR), Infocomm Development
Authority of Singapore (IDA), Ministry of
Communications and Information (MCI),
Ministry of Home Affairs (MHA) and its
agencies, Ministry of Defence MINDEF)
and its agencies, Ministry of Finance
(MOF), National Security Coordination
Secretariat (NSCS) and National Research
Foundation (NRF). Besides being the
national platform that formulates
infocomm security policies and sets

strategic directions for Singapore,
NISC also guides the development and
implementation of the NCSM2018.
The multi-agency committee takes a
risk-based approach to cyber security,
balancing the advantages of using new
technologies and capabilities against the
related security risks. While recognising
that infocomm technology and the
Internet can enhance service quality
and create new opportunities, these
technologies can also potentially be
exploited for malicious activities such
as data or identity theft that will
significantly impact businesses.

Public-Private
Partnerships
Cyber Security Awareness Alliance
The Cyber Security Awareness
Alliance was formed in 2008 by IDA
and other like-minded partners from
the Government, private enterprises,
trade associations and non-profit
organisations. The Alliance amalgamates
the efforts of its members by utilising
their collective resources and bringing
together different strengths. It aims to:
•	 Build a positive culture in Singapore
where cyber security becomes second
nature to all infocomm users; and
•	 Promote and enhance awareness
and adoption of essential infocomm
security practices for the private and
people sectors
Over the years, the Alliance had been
reaching out to the People and Private
sectors through exhibitions, talks, as
well as flagship events to promote

awareness and adoption of essential
security measures. Some of its key
flagship events are:
The Cyber Security Awareness
Campaign has been held annually since
2011 to reinforce security awareness
messages to Government, business and
individual users. Through the years,
the Campaign has in turn focused on
Computer Security, Mobile Security,
Wireless Security and Online Security.
From 2011 to 2013, the Campaign
prompted an average of 600,000 pledges
per year by businesses and individuals
responding to the call-to-actions to
secure their computers, wireless
equipment, mobile devices and online
identities. Advertisements were also
placed in national newspapers such as
The Straits Times, TODAY and MyPaper.
In addition, exhibitions, roadshows and
talks were held at public locations such
as libraries and residential hubs to
promote the call-to-actions.

The National Infocomm Security
Competition (NISEC), a feature of the
Cyber Security Awareness Campaign
since 2013, aims to educate the public
about cyber security and the need to
adopt simple yet secure online practices.
NISEC engages the younger generations,
ranging from primary to tertiary levels, in
competitions such as poster design, model
design, multimedia video creation, secure
coding and penetration of web applications.
The Alliance maintains a web portal
https://www.gosafeonline.sg to promote
and inculcate safe infocomm practices
for the public, private and people sectors.
The Alliance also leverages on popular
social media and networking websites to
connect with its target audience.

For the rising numbers of mobile device
users, the Alliance is planning to launch
a mobile application for Android and iOS
platforms. Some of the features include:
•	 Events Calendar
	

Lists Infocomm Security Events that will
be held in Singapore

•	 Security News

International
Collaborations
Association of Infocomm Security
Professionals (AISP)
The Association of Infocomm Security
Professionals (AISP), a collaboration
between Government and Industry, aims to
uplift infocomm security into a distinguished
profession and build a critical pool of
competent infocomm security professionals
who subscribe to the highest professional
standards. The first of such associations
in Asia, the AISP plans to:
•	 Promote, develop, support and
enhance the integrity, technical
competence, management expertise,
status and interests of information
security professionals in Singapore
•	 Promote the development, increase
and spread of information security
knowledge and of any related subject

Ambient Networks Secure Eco system
The Ambient Network Secure Eco System
(ANSES) is an initiative to enhance the secure
interoperability of pervasively deployed “smart”
devices in large networks. One outcome of
the initiative is the development of a security
framework and standards compliance for
IT security hardening and attack protection
for mobile devices, embedded systems
and SCADA systems. Products developed
include a secure and encrypted USB flash
storage solution for mobile workers named
Secure USB for Roaming Users (SURU), and
a Secure Printing System to send print jobs
securely over a network. To foster publicprivate partnership and collaboration, a
series of outreach events known as “ANSES
RahRah seminars” were also held on a
quarterly basis to share ideas and showcase
solutions to industry players, academia and
the public and private sectors.

The Singapore Government continues to
engage other countries and contribute to
global efforts in combating cyber threats.
Some of these engagements include:

ASEAN TELMIN
The ASEAN Telecommunications and
IT Ministers’ Meeting (TELMIN) was
established in 2001 to serve as the main
regional platform to discuss and enhance
cooperation and collaboration among
ASEAN member states. Held annually
to discuss the key focus and direction
of regional cooperation, TELMIN also
aims to strengthen cooperation with
ASEAN Dialogue Partners such as the
People’s Republic of China, Japan and
the Republic of Korea.

Singapore contributes actively to the
TELMIN and its various sub-meetings to
make ICT an engine of growth for ASEAN
and to support the building of an ASEAN
community. A key contribution from
Singapore is the building of confidence
and trust in network and information
security infrastructure to further
promote trade and the use of ICT, as
well as to protect the flow of information.
This is done through various activities
such as the ASEAN Network Security
Action Council (ANSAC), ASEAN-Japan
Information Security Policy Meeting and
the ASEAN CERT Incident Drill (ACID).

The Infocomm Security Masterplans will continue to
serve as strategic blueprints to guide Singapore’s efforts
to foster a secure and resilient national infocomm
environment, while taking a balanced approach between
security requirements and ease of conducting business
or daily activities.
With cyber threats expected to become ever
more sophisticated, it is vital for the Government,
businesses and individuals to exercise vigilance
and continually strengthen Singapore’s infocomm
infrastructure and systems.
Our nation’s resilience against cyber threats will also
appeal to investors by boosting their confidence in
selecting Singapore as a strategic and secure location
for their investments.
Given our heavy reliance on infocomm, Singapore needs
to build up our pool of infocomm security professionals
and develop their competencies. Only then can we better
mitigate cyber threats and provide a trusted and secure
online environment for businesses and individuals.
