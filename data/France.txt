Information systems defence and security 


France’s strategy 


Foreword 



In the French White Paper on Defence and National Security presented by the President in June 
2008, information systems security emerged, alongside deterrence, as an area in which the 
sovereignty of France should be fully expressed. More collective work remains to be done in 
order to fully achieve this. 

Yet cyberspace may seem only remotely related to defence and national security. In twenty 
years, digital technologies have eroded the boundaries between our personal and professional 
lives, raised corporate competitiveness to unprecedented levels, made public services more 

accessible to users and promoted a transparency drive in our country’s institutions. 

Cyberspace, the new Tower of Babel, is a place where the cultures of the world can be 
shared, ideas and information circulated in real-time, and topics discussed among individuals. 
Exclusion from the digital world condemns individuals to isolation, companies to decline and 
nations to dependency. 

In the material world, the violent acts of criminals and the destruction caused by wars and 
terrorism are highly visible and usually subject to wide media coverage. In cyberspace, the 

consequences of computer attacks on government, companies or individuals’ information 

systems are most of the time visible only to specialists and remain unknown to the general 
public. 

Cyberspace, like a virtual battleground, has become a place for confrontation: appropriation 
of personal data, espionage of the scientific, economic and commercial assets of companies 
which fall victim to competitors or foreign powers, disruption of services necessary for the 
proper functioning of the economy and daily life, compromise of information related to our 
sovereignty and even, in certain circumstances, loss of human lives are nowadays the potential 
or actual consequences of the overlap between the digital world and human activity. 

Given the sudden emergence of cyberspace in the field of national security and the extent of 
the challenges ahead, the French government decided to provide France with a structured 
defence and security capability. In 2009, therefore, it set up the French Network and Information 
Security Agency (Agence nationale de la sécurité des systèmes d’information or ANSSI), to meet 
the needs of public institutions, companies and individuals. In July 2010, the President decided 
to make the Agency responsible for the defence of information systems in addition to its security 
role. 

The purpose of this document is to outline the strategy undertaken by France since the 
publication of the French White Paper on Defence and National Security in order to safeguard 
the security of our citizens, our companies and our nation in cyberspace.

Information systems defence and security strategy 


Summary 


Among the major threats that France will have to face over the next fifteen years, 
the 2008 French White Paper on Defence and National Security cited large-scale 
cyberattacks on national infrastructures. 

This observation led to the French Government’s decision to significantly strengthen 

national cyberdefence capabilities. The creation of the French Network and Information 
Security Agency (ANSSI) in 2009 was the first step of this process. 

This description of the national strategy on information systems defence and 
security presented in this document reflects the ambitions set out in the White Paper. 
This strategy is based on four objectives. 

1. Become a world power in cyberdefence 
While maintaining its strategic independence, France must work to ensure that it 
belongs to the inner circle of leading nations in the area of cyberdefence. We will thus 
benefit from the knock-on effect of cooperation both at an operational level and in the 
implementation of a unified strategy to face common threats. 

2. Safeguard France’s ability to make decisions through the protection of 
information related to its sovereignty 
Governmental authorities and crisis management actors must have the resources to 
communicate in any situation and in total confidentiality. The networks that meet this 
need must be expanded, particularly at the local level. 

Ensuring the confidentiality of the information circulating over these networks requires 
mastered security products. We must keep the necessary expertise to design them and 
optimise their development and production methods. 

3. Strengthen the cybersecurity of critical national infrastructures 
To function correctly, our society is increasingly dependent on information systems and 
networks, particularly the Internet. A successful attack on a French critical information 
system or the Internet could have serious human or economic consequences. In close 
collaboration with the relevant equipment manufacturers and operators, the State must 
work to guarantee and improve the security of these critical systems. 

Information systems defence and security strategy 


Summary Summary 
4. Ensure security in cyberspace 
The threats to information systems simultaneously affect public services, private 
companies and citizens. 

Public services must operate in an exemplary fashion and improve the protection of 
their information systems and the data entrusted to them. 

Simultaneously, campaigns to raise information and awareness among companies and 
citizens must be undertaken. 

In terms of the fight against cybercrime, France will promote the strengthening of the 
current legislation and international judicial cooperation. 

In order to meet these objectives, seven areas of action have been identified: 

1. Effectively anticipate and analyse the environment in order to make appropriate 
decisions. 
2. Detect and block attacks, alert and support potential victims. 
3. Enhance and perpetuate our scientific, technical, industrial and human 
capabilities in order to maintain our independence. 
4. Protect the information systems of the State and the operators of critical 
infrastructures to ensure better national resilience. 
5. Adapt French legislation to incorporate technological developments and new 
practices. 
6. Develop international collaboration initiatives in the areas of information 
systems security, cyberdefence and fight against cybercrime in order to better 
protect national information systems. 
7. Communicate, inform and convince to increase the understanding by the 
French population of the extent of the challenges related to information systems 
security. 
This document summarises the public part of the guidelines and actions approved 
by the strategic committee on information systems security instituted under Decree 
No. 2009-834 of 7 July 2009 creating the French Network and Information Security 
Agency* (ANSSI) 

.

« France must retain its areas of sovereignty, concentrated on 
the capability necessary for the maintenance of the strategic and 
political autonomy of the nation: nuclear deterrence; ballistic 
missiles; SSBNs and SSNs; and cyber-security are amongst the 
priorities. »

Information systems defence and security strategy 


Four strategic objectives 


1. Become a world power in 
cyberdefence 
The development of an information society, 
supported by electronic communication 
networks, is a tremendous driver of French 
growth as it creates value and employment. It 
significantly contributes to the competitiveness 

of our economy and therefore to France’s 

international standing. 

Yet electronic communication networks are subject to illicit activities 
carried out either directly or indirectly by foreign States. Some conduct wide-scale 
espionage operations through these networks in order to access information relating 
to our sovereignty such as classified national defence material, or to the scientific, 

technological, commercial or financial assets of companies operating in our nation’s 

strategic sectors. 

Terrorist groups also use these same communication networks to spread their ideas, 
disseminate operational information to their organisations and conduct propaganda 
activities. 

In the near future, foreign States or terrorist groups could attack the critical infrastructures 
of States that they consider as ideologically hostile. 

It is therefore essential for France to acquire a cyberdefence capability. 

Yet, unlike in the material world, confrontations in cyberspace know no boundaries. 
Thus credible cyberdefence cannot be limited to national level. It must rely upon a 
network of allies with whom real-time information can be exchanged on vulnerabilities, 
protection mechanisms, attacks and countermeasures that can be implemented against 
cyberattacks led directly or indirectly by States or terrorist groups. France will strengthen 
its operational partnerships with its closest allies and will build on its expertise to actively 
contribute to formulating cyberdefence policies within international organisations, in 
particular the European Union.

Four strategic objectives Four strategic objectives 
2. Safeguard France’s ability to make decisions 
through 
the protection of 
information related to its 
sovereignty 

The need to instantly access and share 
information in multiple formats is 

increasingly becoming a trend in today’s 
society. Nevertheless, part of the world’s 

stability still lies in the ability to conceal the 

«information related to our sovereignty”, 

i.e. the fragments of diplomatic, military, 
scientific, technical and economic information that allow 
freedom of action and determine the prosperity of nations. 

Just as in the past, intelligence services around the world, among others, attempt to 
obtain information related to our sovereignty. Communications networks, particularly 
the Internet, the information they contain and the data available on the terminals 
connected to them have become both sources of information and a means of collecting 
it. 

The most effective way to protect information related to our sovereignty is the use 
of cryptography* techniques which prevent, or at least delay, the understanding of 
information should it be disclosed or intercepted. Developments in cryptanalysis*, 
which mirror those in computer processing power, require the conception and use of 
methods and techniques that are more difficult to analyse and regularly renewed. 

Preserving our strategic independence depends on our ability to master cryptographic 
techniques and key technologies needed to design our security products*; therefore 
we need to ensure that the field of information systems security remains attractive for 
young graduates in order to prevent the gradual erosion of our expertise. 

In addition to the need to communicate in a safe and confidential way, both decision-
makers and organisations involved in crisis management must have at their disposal 
means of communication which can be used in all circumstances. These secured 
resources for electronic data exchange, telephony and videoconferencing have already 
been designed and developed. We will keep on deploying them over the coming years, 
in particularly for operators of critical infrastructures*.

Four strategic objectives Four strategic objectives 
3. Strengthen the cybersecurity of critical 
national infrastructures 
Through the convergence of multiple technologies, the real and 
virtual worlds are increasingly becoming overlapped. Many 
real world objects - from supermarket labels to refineries, from 
photocopiers to combat drones - have built-in information 
systems and are connected to others. Remotely, through 
networks, it becomes possible to collect the information 
transmitted by these objects, to keep them operating and to 
control them. 

In its Defence Code, France defined critical sectors in which 
operators meet needs essential to the life of the population, the exercise of State 
authority, the running of the economy, the maintaining of defence capabilities and the 

nation’s security, as these activities are difficult to substitute or replace. 

Most operators of critical infrastructures make widespread use of communication 
networks, especially the Internet, both for the management of their activities and their 
work. However, in the long-standing relationship between the industrial world and the 
IT world, revolutionised by the interconnection of systems, the industrial world lacks 
training and awareness of information systems security, while the IT world often has a 
poor understanding of the constraints and functioning of industrial systems. 

The dependence of all stakeholders on the Internet is increased due to the major trends 
of our economic and social organisation: outsourcing and cloud computing, pooling 
of support services, real-time and just-in-time management, roaming, task transfer to 
customers and citizens, creation or re-engineering of numerous processes. 

Should communications networks or the Internet be interrupted, the resources available 
to replace them may prove to be highly insufficient, especially because of the lack of 
qualified personnel capable of reinstating processes prior to the advent of the digital 
era. In the case of processes resulting directly from new practices linked to information 
technology, the resources to replace them do not yet exist. 

As world news regularly demonstrates, the possible consequences of malicious actions 
against the automated control systems of industrial processes used by operators of 
critical infrastructures have not yet been properly assessed. As a result, protecting 
electronic communication networks - and in particular the Internet - together with 

securing the core systems of critical infrastructures’ operators have become national 

priorities. 

Information systems defence and security strategy 13 


Four strategic objectives Four strategic objectives 
4. Ensure security in cyberspace 
For an increasing number of our citizens, the use of 
electronic communication networks like the Internet 
is permeating the most common activities of daily 
life such as shopping, administrative procedures 
and interpersonal communications. 

Simultaneously, the techniques used in cyberspace 
by malicious individuals or groups of individuals 
are more and more efficient and aim to steal 
identities, obtain the information needed to 
access bank accounts or collect and resell 
personal data. Cases of malicious remote 
takeovers of computers, in order to incorporate 
them into networks of compromised machines 

(«botnets*») to carry out illegal activities such 

as cyberattacks or sending malicious e-mails, 
have also been dramatically increasing. 


Given these developments, public authorities must set an example by 
protecting public cyberspace. Users must be able to trust the electronic services offered 
by the administration, particularly in regard to protection of their personal data. The 
General Security Framework* (RGS) published in early 2010 provides a regulatory 
context for strengthening this security. Compliance and implementation by public 
authorities are priorities. 

Securing cyberspace systematically involves providing companies and individuals with 
the relevant information on the risks and the ways to limit them. The long-term objective 

is to raise citizens’ awareness of cybersecurity issues during the education process. This 

initiative will require the implementation of an active governmental communication 
policy. 

Last but not least, laws must govern the Internet. France must support the strengthening 
or enactment of legal rules in cyberspace when existing legislation proves to be 
insufficient, and promote international judicial cooperation on repression of offences 
committed on or through electronic communication networks. 

In order to achieve our four strategic objectives, 
7 areas of action have been identified. 

14 Information systems defence and security strategy 


Seven areas of action 


1. Anticipate and analyse 
Risks and threats evolve rapidly in cyberspace. The release of a new product or a new 
version of software, the disclosure of an uncorrected flaw in a widely used software 
product, the development of new technologies or practices, or even a political statement 
can threaten the security of information systems within a very short period of time. 

• 
In light of this, the first step to ensure our information systems’ security and 
defence is to monitor the latest technology developments and analyse, fully 
understand and even anticipate the actions of public or private actors. 

2. Detect, alert and respond 
Given the increasing dependence of companies, infrastructures and services on the 
Internet, and because of the systemic risks related to some weaknesses, it is essential to 
be able to detect flaws and attacks as soon as possible, alert potential and known victims 
and offer them rapid assistance with the analysis and development of countermeasures. 

• 
As planned in the French White Paper on Defence and National Security, 
France is developing a detection capability for attacks on information systems. 
Deployed in particular within ministry networks, these systems enable the 
relevant personnel to be alerted, help assess the nature of attacks and create 
appropriate countermeasures. 
• 
In order to manage all the information either gathered by these detection tools, 
by monitoring mechanisms or provided by our partners, so as to obtain a real-
time picture of the national network situation, and if necessary manage a crisis 
situation, the ANSSI has been equipped with an «operations room» adapted to 

the challenges. 

• 
In order to respond to major crises affecting or threatening the security of 
the information systems of the administration or the operators of critical 
infrastructures, the State must be able to take the necessary measures rapidly. 
To this end, the ANSSI is the national Authority in charge of information systems 
defence.

Seven areas of action Seven areas of action 
3. Enhance and perpetuate our scientific, technical, 
industrial and human capabilities 
The security of information systems is based on mastery of technology and knowhow 
that is also accessible to organisations and individuals intending on damaging 
them. State actors responsible for information systems security must not only be familiar 
with state-of-the-art technology, they must also be able to foresee or even spur on 
technological developments by maintaining their research capabilities, as this is the 
only way of limiting the tactical advantage of the attacker over the defender. 

France has world-class research teams in the areas of cryptology and formal methods. 
In other areas, such as security architecture of information systems, it is rapidly catching 
up with the most advanced nations. 

• 
In order to drive this research forward, the possibility of creating a cyberdefence 
research centre in collaboration with industrial partners is currently being 
examined. This centre would carry out scientific research activities (cryptology 
studies, analysis of attacking groups and their methods, expertise on malware 
and software flaws, development of secure open source software, drafting of 
cyberdefence concepts,...), as well as expertise and training activities. 
The development of the information society offers companies a worldwide market, 
currently dominated by actors located outside of Europe. As far as information systems 
security is concerned, this situation is neither desirable nor tenable. Yet France does 
have a state-of-the-art industrial base unique in Europe, with the potential to master 
a large part of the technologies needed for the design of security products, including 
components. This base is made up of a large number of innovative SMEs. However, 
these companies have not yet reached the required critical size and are not in sufficient 
demand. 

• 
Industrial strengthening will be promoted using the various resources of the 
State, in particular through strategic investment funds. 
In order to ensure better efficiency, the designers of IT products and information systems 
must take security issues into account from the very beginning of the development 
process. The presence of information systems security experts in our industrial base must 
therefore be increased. Orienting young people towards such jobs will be encouraged 
in order to expand the pool of expertise available in the country. 

As a general rule, scientific and technical training on information technology must 
incorporate courses on information systems security. 

16 Information systems defence and security strategy 


Seven areas of action Seven areas of action 
4. Protect the information systems of the State and the 
operators of critical infrastructures 
As stated in the French White Paper on National Defence and Security, France must 

«master and develop very high-security products to protect State secrets, as well as a 
range of guaranteed ‘trusted products and services’ for use by government agencies 
and services which will be made widely available to the business sector». Resilient 
secure networks* for «the entire decision-making and command chain in Metropolitan 
France» must be used. 

• 
With regard to classified information*, the French strategy on security products 
and components has been redefined. In particular, it takes full account of France 
rejoining NATO integrated command. 
• 
Within ministerial networks, the introduction of robust authentication systems 
based, for example, on the use of smart card technology, an area of French 
excellence, will have a very significant impact on the level of security. 
• 
Government authorities now have a secure interdepartmental intranet, a high-
availability telephone network that will be fully equipped with new encryption 
terminals by 2012, and a secure videoconferencing system mainly for use in 
ministerial decision-making centres. Deployment of these various networks will 
continue, especially in local administrations. 
• 
With regard to the security of the information systems of operators of critical 
infrastructures, a public-private partnership will be set up, firstly so that these 
operators can benefit from the information gathered by the State on threat analysis; 
and secondly, to allow the State to ensure the appropriate level of protection of 
the infrastructures that are crucial to keep the country running properly. Such 
assessments will also be undertaken with equipment manufacturers. 
5. Adapt French legislation 
New practices introduced through the development of cyberspace can, if not enough 
attention is paid, threaten individual freedoms, the functioning of critical infrastructures 
and the stability of our companies. 

Information systems defence and security strategy 17 


Seven areas of action Seven areas of action 
Our legislative and regulatory framework must reflect recent developments in 
technology. Laws will be reviewed as new technologies and new practices emerge 
in order to strengthen the security of individuals while at the same time ensuring a 

balance between the desire to minimise the impact on companies’ competitiveness 
and the need for the State to be able to intervene in the nation’s best interest. 

• 
Regarding operators of electronic communications, transposition of European 
directives into French law will enable the enactment of new rules to protect 
information systems and alert government authorities in case of incidents. 
• 
The enforcement of the «General Security Framework» (RGS) and its development 
will allow public authorities to significantly raise the protection levels of their 
information systems, particularly in their relations with users. 

6. Develop our international collaborations 
The security of information systems is partly based on the quality of the data exchange 
between relevant services of various States. France will seek to establish a wide network 

of foreign partners in order to promote the sharing of essential data – e.g. information 

on vulnerabilities or flaws of products and services. 

France will also strengthen its relationships with its partners to fight cybercrime. 

Similarly, strong relations between allies form the basis of an effective cyberdefence 
policy. France is building a highly select circle of trustworthy partners with whom in-
depth operational exchanges will be held. 

7. Communicate to inform and convince 
The security of information systems relies as much on personal vigilance as on the 
organisation, the choices and technical measures introduced by companies and the 
action of governments. 

Given the potential consequences of a major attack on information systems on the 
country and its citizens, we must ensure the awareness and motivation of individuals 
and organisations. 

18 Information systems defence and security strategy 


Seven areas of action Seven areas of action 
In France, information and public debate on the threats posed by damage to the 
security of information systems and its impact on defence and national security, or 
simply on our daily lives, remain largely underdeveloped. 

• 
ANSSI will provide targeted support to decision-makers in order to help them 
draw up measures and make the necessary decisions regarding the security of 
information systems that are critical to the running of their organisations and the 
protection of their technical, scientific, commercial and financial assets. 
• 
In a more general sense, appropriate communication campaigns will be 
conducted by ANSSI targeting the general public and companies.

Glossary 


Botnet 

A botnet, or robot network, is a network of 
compromised machines controlled by a 
malicious individual (the master). The network 
is structured in a way that allows its master to 
transmit orders to some or all of the machines 
in the network and operate freely. 

Comment: some networks consist of a huge 
number of machines (several million). They 
may be illegally traded or used to carry out 
malicious activities against other machines.
